        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Just two years ago, Bhavish Aggarwal was facing one of his biggest tests. A video on social media showed an Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. vehicle bursting into flames in the Indian city of Pune, raising doubts about whether his bet on the world\u2019s biggest e-scooter factory would ultimately pay off.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure How a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture NYC Subway Riders See \u2018Exceptionally High\u2019 Air Pollution New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants New York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\n\nThe outspoken founder, who\u2019s drawn parallels to Elon Musk, bounced back. Now, the company\u2019s public listing is set to cement his position as one of the world\u2019s youngest billionaires.\n\nAggarwal, 38, will add $1.2 billion to his wealth if his SoftBank Group Corp.-backed Ola Electric lists Friday in Mumbai at the lowest end of the price band at 72 rupees ($0.86) a share, giving the entrepreneur a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ola Electric did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Aggarwal\u2019s net worth.\n\nDespite being yet to turn a profit since it was founded in Bengaluru in 2017, Ola Electric is among the many electric vehicle-linked firms looking at India\u2019s public market to raise money, tapping into the craze for alternative fuels in one of the busiest countries for new share offerings. The firm made a net loss of 14.7 billion rupees in the financial year ended March 2023, its offer document shows.\n\n\u201cThree years ago when we launched our product, I believe that\u2019s when the EV story began,\u201d Aggarwal said at a press conference in Mumbai in late July.\n\nJust two years after its founding and without having shipped a single scooter, Ola Electric had become a unicorn \u2014 a startup with a $1 billion valuation \u2014 thanks to early funding from the likes of SoftBank and Tiger Global Management. At a time when India\u2019s green infrastructure was in its nascency, Aggarwal aimed to build the world\u2019s leading \u201curban mobility EV company,\u201d he told Bloomberg News in 2021.\n\nBut the company encountered some early stumbles. Shortly after it debuted its electric two-wheelers in 2021, it saw a major setback when Ola scooters were caught up in a spate of high-profile EV battery fires across the country.\n\nThe company recalled more than 1,400 scooters in the wake of the incidents.\n\nTaking on Tesla\n\nA serial entrepreneur, Aggarwal has started companies operating in a range of industries from online payments to artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven before the listing of his electric-vehicle company, Aggarwal had joined an exclusive club. Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index of the world\u2019s top 500 billionaires lists only seven under the age of 40 across the world, excluding Meta Platforms Inc. founders Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz both of whom turned 40 in May.\n\nAggarwal in many ways embodies Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s more confident and assertive India. Never one to shy away from offering an opinion, Aggarwal appeared to welcome Tesla Inc.\u2019s decision last month not to invest in India, saying in a post on X, \u201cthis is Tesla\u2019s loss, not India\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHe seems to relish competing with global giants such as Musk\u2019s EV venture on his home turf. As he put it in an interview with Bloomberg last year: \u201cTesla is for the West, Ola is for the rest.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from one of India\u2019s top technology-focused schools, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Aggarwal started out working at Microsoft Research India before founding his first company in 2010. Ola Cabs, or ANI Technologies Pvt., was launched as a ride-hailing app to rival Uber Technologies Inc. and soon expanded beyond cab services into online payments and food-delivery.\n\nHe founded his latest venture, Krutrim, in 2023, which became India\u2019s first $1 billion AI startup in January this year. Through Krutrim, he plans on building large language models, data centers, and ultimately servers and super computers for the AI ecosystem.\n\nAll of his firms are in tech-led sectors, creating data that can be used by his other businesses, said Nitin Pangarkar, associate professor of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore. \u201cBut the attention given to the businesses could be an issue.\u201d\n\nHe owns stake in Ola Cabs and Krutrim, and has also invested undisclosed amounts in tea chain Chaayos and news platform YourStory among others as an angel investor, according to data from Tracxn Technologies Ltd.\n\nHe is a vocal supporter of Modi\u2019s aim to boost local manufacturing, and often takes to social media as well as blogs to talk about how his firms can contribute to India\u2019s economic growth.\n\nIn May, he ditched Microsoft Azure\u2019s cloud services for his firm\u2019s and moved to Krutrim cloud after a LinkedIn chatbot used gender neutral pronouns with him. Criticizing Microsoft for \u201cpronoun illness\u201d on his X account, he said Indians need to move away from western concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion and set their own guidelines.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like India\u2019s Elon Musk,\u201d said Pangarkar. \u201cBrash and abrasive and all that. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Musk from succeeding.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Dave Sebastian and Pei Yi Mak.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Former Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive Rohan Patel said on Wednesday that California GovernorGavin Newsom and his team have \u201cbent over backwards\u201d to help the EV giant despite CEO Elon Musk\u2018s criticisms.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry \u2013 Here\u2019s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks. Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nWhat Happened: \u201cNewsom and his team bent over backwards to help Tesla. We didn't always agree with every action, but his top leadership always was willing to help whenever we asked,\u201d Patel wrote, while also noting that the Governor owns a Tesla Roadster and a Model S. Patel was Tesla\u2019s vice president of global public policy and business development until April earlier this year.\n\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nPatel further added that not all who find Musk\u2019s political stances disturbing are against the company, its employees, or its products.\n\n\u201cEven after the harshest tweets against Newsom or Biden or another Dem, their teams and governments did not shut me or my team out and were professional in working with us for the greater good,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNewsom (Roadster and Model S owner with Tesla solar/powerwalls) and his team bent over backwards to help Tesla. We didn't always agree with every action, but his top leadership always was willing to help whenever we asked. \r\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of @WholeMarsBlog and his... https://t.co/8Zxojg80G4\n\n\u2014 Rohan Patel (@rohanspatel) August 8, 2024\n\nTrending: Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nPatel was refuting Tesla enthusiast Omar Qazi, who goes by the username \u201cWhole Mars Catalog.\u201d Qazi alleged that democrats hate Tesla after Newsom applauded EV startup Rivian for their rise in new registrations in the state of California during the second quarter and noted that Tesla is no longer the exclusive EV manufacturer for EVs in the state.\n\nWhy It Matters: \u201cI want to applaud and thank the extraordinary work that Rivian has done,\u201d Newsom said on Tuesday. \u201cTesla is not the exclusive manufacturer any longer in this space. You're seeing a dramatic shift in competition across the sector. This is exactly what was predicted. This is exactly what we have been promoting: competition in the space.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from the California New Car Dealers Association released last month, California's BEV market share through the end of the second quarter stood 21.4%, much higher than the U.S. BEV market share of 7.5%.\n\nTrending: Want to invest in homes? $100 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nAs per the association, Tesla's new registrations fell 17% in the first half of 2024 while that of Rivian Automotive rose by nearly 77% in California. Tesla's mass-market Model Y SUV, however, continues to be the best-selling EV in the state, followed by the Model 3.\n\nLast month, Patel also said that the Biden administration treated EV giant fairly in certain issues despite \"surface-level disappointment\" between the President and Musk.\n\n\"No doubt Biden is very biased towards unions and appoints pro-Union people to the nlrb making it easier to organize. But it didn\u2019t often create substantive problems, and instead was more of a PR and surface-level disappointment,\" Patel wrote on X while adding that it is just his personal view.\n\nRead More:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

        "content": "Rivian And Lucid Show That Wealthy Backers Are The Only Chance For Survival Of EV-Only Companies\n\nThe latest earnings reports from\u00a0Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN)\u00a0and\u00a0Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ: LCID)\u00a0made two things clear. The first is that pure play EV makers are continuing to struggle, burning a ton of cash along the way. The second is that having wealthy backers makes the difference between survival and bankruptcy, the latter being the one that the wealthy-backer-free Fisker declared in June.\n\nRivian\u2019s Lifeline Is Volkswagen\u2019s $5 Billion Gamble\n\nRivian is already seeing supply chain tailwinds from its planned $5 billion joint venture with Volkswagen\u00a0(OTC: VWAGY) that was announced in June.\u00a0The partnership gives Rivian the opportunity to scale beyond its product line and benefit from Volkswagen, more precisely its portfolio and strength.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to the Volkswagen relationship, Rivian is also expected to gain more favorable pricing from suppliers and therefore, thanks to Volkswagen, Rivian will be able to also save on hardware components.\n\nRivian remains laser-focused on reducing the costs of making its R1 while it continues to source materials for the forthcoming R2, whose production is set to kick off in 2026.\u00a0In what its CEO RJ Scaringe named a \u201cpivotal operational event,\u201d Rivian\u00a0retooled its manufacturing plant in\u00a0Normal, Illinois during the second quarter, which is said to have contributed to a 30% improvement on the R1 line rate, achieving gross cost per vehicle of $33,000, which is $10,000 down from 2023\u2019s comparable quarter cost.\n\nDuring the company\u2019s Q2\u00a0earnings call,\u00a0Rivian reported a 41% improvement in its cash flow from operations compared to the first quarter, but\u00a0still lost a staggering $1.46 billion, which is $300 million worse compared to last year\u2019s quarter.\u00a0Although the securities filing shows that Rivian projects a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2024,\u00a0Rivian is also targeting to reach its first-ever positive gross margin before 2024 comes to a close.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund Has Lucid\u2019s Back\n\nAlso for the second quarter, Lucid Group reported a net loss of $643 million which is a slight improvement compared to 2023\u2019s quarter when the luxury EV maker reported a loss of $764 million. But, thanks to its majority shareholder bringing in an additional $1.5 billion, Lucid secured the extension of its lifespan.\n\nWithout ICE or hybrid vehicles to fall back on, Rivian and Lucid are feeling the EV cooldown way more than legacy automakers like Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and others.\u00a0\u00a0But, even the mighty Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is racing to refresh its ageing lineup with an affordable EV. Rivian is doing the same with the R2 and\u00a0Lucid is going the same with the Gravity SUV.\u00a0With these novelties, Lucid, Rivian as well as Tesla hope to\u00a0attract new customers. Even the mighty Tesla needs to spark some fresh EV enthusiasm.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, innovations on the EV front keep on coming.\n\nWorksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP),\u00a0a U.S.-based manufacturer and innovator of hybrid and clean energy solutions for light trucks will expand its market presence this summer with an innovative power duo COR & SOLIS, or\u00a0more precisely, their alpha release. With a solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS and a portable battery system COR, Worksport promises to do much more than enhance the range of electric pickups, as it brings off-grid power on the go, opening many new opportunities with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis pickups, even Tesla, whose long-awaited Cybertruck came with many challenges. To enhanceinvestor engagement\u00a0and transparency, Worksport\u00a0announced a\u00a0Q&A portal ahead of its\u00a0upcoming Q2 2024 earnings call. Scheduled for\u00a0August 13th, 2024, at 4:30 p.m, Woksport management will use the call to provide\u00a0a\u00a0detailed\u00a0overview of the second quarter financial results and guidance, along with the sales trajectory, key product launches, and future plans.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "A lieutenant from a South Florida fire department says they are preparing for the opening of a planned transit operations center that will house 100 60-foot articulated battery-electric-buses, which poses a variety of new challenges.\n\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue (MDFR) Lt. Mike Adams says the EV industry is changing so rapidly and is so new that departments are trying to keep up. The South Dade Transit Operations Center is set to house Miami-Dade County\u2019s Metrobus fleet as early as next summer, with project completion slated for summer 2026.\n\nAdams said he and his team are as \"equipped as we can be\" for electric vehicle (EV) fires, which are more difficult to handle than standard car fires.\n\n\"They burn a lot hotter, a lot faster, and they take a lot more water to put out,\" Adams told FOX Business over the phone about EV fires, adding that a typical car fire takes about 300 to 400 gallons to put out, whereas an electric vehicle fire could take 10 times as much.\n\nTESLA BATTERY CATCHES FIRE IN ILLINOIS, SHUTTING DOWN HIGHWAY FOR NEARLY 3 HOURS: REPORT Six Tesla electric cars burn on a trailer in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 6, 2023.\n\nMDFR firefighters are \"constantly\" getting new training and industry standards because there is no \"silver bullet\" to putting EV fires out. Along with taking more water, Adams said EV fires also take more time and labor to extinguish, which means greater cost. Most EV fires are just doused with water until they burn out on their own, he said.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAdams said he is involved in state-level EV testing in an attempt to get some sort of standard operating procedure or policy for fire departments.\n\nWhile the EV fire trend is picking up, according to Adams they are still rare.\n\nIn terms of the transit center, which Adams said is still in the design and engineering phase, many people are involved due to the lack of building codes specific for EV housing structures.\n\n\"An EV vehicle is a lot heavier than a regular car,\" Adams said. \"You have to reinforce the building for structural, especially if it's goinna be like a parking garage where there's multiple floors. So you gotta re-engineer the building to handle the extra load, then you gotta re-engineer the electrical to handle the charging requirements for them, and then you have to do the same thing for automatic sprinklers and suppression systems on the fire side.\"\n\nGM LOST TAX CREDITS ON 20,000 EVS DUE TO BATTERY SOURCING REQUIREMENTS Several burnt-out Tesla Model Y electric vehicles sit in a parking lot in Frankfurt, Germany, on Sept. 14, 2023.\n\nWhen it comes to buses, Adams said the bigger the vehicle, the bigger the battery. Diagrams of the buses he has seen show the batteries on the roof, which creates height and access problems.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last month, a driver crashed his Tesla in Texas before it caught fire. Video released by the Colony Police Department showed officers breaking a window to rescue the driver.\n\nOfficers attempted to put the flames out, according to KLTV, but it kept reigniting.\n\nIn June, what appears to be a newer Tesla Model 3 burned for two hours and took 45,000 gallons of water until it was put out, Panama City Beach Fire Rescue said on Facebook.\n\n\"The protective casing around the batteries suffered major damage causing thermal runaway,\" the post reads. Thermal runaway is \"a chain reaction within a battery cell that can be very difficult to stop once it has started,\" Dragonfly Energy states.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAdams said every carmaker is now in the EV business, and those choosing to hit the roads in them need to be aware of potential risks.\n\n\"Consumers have to be aware of their vehicles,\" he said. \"They have to look for telltale signs of a failure. They have to use the right charging cords or charging stations. They have to watch out for damage, like running things over on the road. They have to be more aware that there is potential danger.\"\n\nOriginal article source:Planned Florida electric bus center poses new challenges, including potential EV fires\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best EV Stocks Under $50.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against the other EV stocks under $50.\n\nEV Sales are Growing\n\nSince 2018, electric vehicle (EV) sales have been rapidly growing as the world tries to reach its carbon neutrality goal by 2050. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), only 2% of new vehicles registered globally were electric vehicles, and reached 18% by the end of 2023. Even though most of these sales were concentrated in China, Europe, and the US, other markets such as India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Latin America have also been adopting the EV trend at a fast pace.\n\nIn 2024, while the high costs due to interest rates stalled EV sales a little, they are still growing at a significant pace as the sales reached 3.4 million units in Q1, compared to 2.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, according to the IEA. Furthermore, the accounting and consulting firm, PwC analyzed 21 markets and found out that in the second quarter of 2024, 37% of vehicles sold in these markets were battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), or hybrids, marking an increase from 30% in the same period of 2023. At the same time, overall EV sales rose by 21% compared to Q2 2023, while sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles declined by 9% during the same period.\n\nBloombergNEF's Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook shows that as technology improves and battery prices drop, EV adoption is increasingly driven by consumer demand. Passenger EV sales are expected to surpass 30 million units in 2027 and reach 73 million units by 2040.\n\nGlobal EV Market to Reach $63 Trillion by 2050\n\nDespite such progress, strong policy support is still needed, as only 69% of the global car fleet is expected to be electrified by 2050 in the base case scenario, short of the 100% target in the Net Zero scenario.\n\nHeavy trucks and other segments lag in reaching net zero and full combustion vehicle sales need to stop by 2038 to reach the goal. The report states that the global EV market could reach $63 trillion by 2050, with significant investment needed in battery production and charging infrastructure.\n\nAccording to estimates by Fortune Business Insights, the global EV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.8% from 2024 to 2032, and Asia is currently the dominant region with a 51.24% market share. This is the time for investors to take positions in EV stocks, as the EV market is just getting started and is poised for a lot of growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify over 25 electric vehicle manufacturers with a stock price of under $50, as of August 7. We narrowed down our list to 7 stocks that were most widely held by institutional investors and listed the stocks in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way.\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nShare Price as of August 7: $9.77\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the biggest names in the automotive industry in the world. The company manufactures and sells a range of commercial and luxury vehicles under the brand names Ford and Lincoln, respectively. While Ford (NYSE:F) is mostly known for its gas-guzzling muscle cars and trucks, the company is also making significant strides in the EV industry.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Jim Farley announced plans to introduce a $30,000 all-electric vehicle in about two and a half years, emphasizing that profitability is a key focus. During the Aspen Ideas Festival held around the last week of June, Farley revealed that this vehicle, developed by a specialized Ford team, is intended to compete with Chinese automakers like BYD and an upcoming entry-level Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) model.\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is prioritizing smaller, more affordable EVs over larger all-electric trucks and SUVs, as Farley believes the latter is unlikely to be profitable due to the high costs of large battery packs. He highlighted the need for a shift in focus to smaller vehicles for both economic and environmental reasons, despite the historical profitability of larger vehicles like the company\u2019s trucks.\n\nApart from that, Ford (NYSE:F) is also a shareholder-friendly company as it was mentioned in our best dividend-paying stocks under $15 article. We mentioned the company\u2019s strong cash and liquidity position which allows the company\u2019s long-term growth and returns to shareholders. The company has consistently issued supplemental dividends to shareholders over the years, alongside its regular common dividend. As of August 7, the company has a dividend yield of 6.1% with a payout ratio of a little over 31%.\n\nIn Q1, 41 hedge funds had stakes in Ford (NYSE:F), amounting to $1.54 billion. The most prominent stake is held by Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management with 62.52 million shares worth $830.301 million.\n\nOverall F ranks 2nd on our list of the best EV stocks to buy. You can visit 7 Best EV Stocks Under $50to see the other EV stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of F as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than F but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital",
        "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tesla is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.084 = US$7.2b \u00f7 (US$113b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nTherefore, Tesla has an ROCE of 8.4%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.7% average generated by the Auto industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Tesla  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Tesla's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Tesla .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Tesla Tell Us?\n\nWe're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 8.4%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 282% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Tesla can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a staggering 1,234% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.\n\nOn a final note, we've found  1 warning sign for Tesla that we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Tesla isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Tough Summer for US Stocks Overshadows Estimate-Beating Earnings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A tough summer for US stocks is overshadowing Corporate America\u2019s best-received earnings season in years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure New York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants NYC Subway Riders See \u2018Exceptionally High\u2019 Air Pollution The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\n\nDespite big selloffs for the likes of Tesla Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., the median reaction for S&P 500 firms that beat profit estimates outperformed the benchmark by 1.7% on the day of reporting results \u2014 the widest margin in Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s records going back to 2019 \u2014 while the median reaction for stocks missing forecasts trailed the index by just 1.1%, one of the narrowest margins over the same period.\n\nSo while the S&P 500 is down more than 7% since JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported its results on July 12, the unofficial start to the quarterly earnings season, the market is also rewarding individual companies that are delivering on their promises.\n\nThe trends are in response to the strongest profit growth for US firms in over three years in absolute terms. Already facing a high bar coming into the reporting season, S&P 500 firms have still managed to beat expectations overall with a 13% leap in second-quarter profits. That\u2019s the sharpest increase since the fourth quarter of 2021, BI data show. And it has helped alleviate concerns of softening consumer demand and weaker pricing power due to cooling inflation.\n\nCan\u2019t Complain\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been little to complain about with respect to the S&P 500\u2019s earnings,\u201d said Gina Martin Adams, BI\u2019s chief equity strategist. \u201cThough revenue misses have been more frequent than usual, guidance momentum is now positive,\u201d she wrote in a note on Monday entitled Stop Blaming Earnings for S&P Struggles.\n\nAmong some of the most notable rallies this season, DoorDash Inc. surged 8.4% on Friday after posting results that analysts deemed \u201cstellar\u201d at a time of \u201cmeltdown\u201d in the quick-service restaurant industry. Barbie maker Mattel Inc. jumped 10% on July 24 because of its impressive margins, while BNY Mellon Corp. hit a record high on July 12 following its estimate-beating earnings report.\n\nStill, the S&P 500 at an index level has reaped no rewards from this strong season. Instead, the stock market is fixated on worries about excessive valuations in high-flying technology companies stoked by an artificial intelligence frenzy and concerns that the Federal Reserve hasn\u2019t cut interest rates fast enough to stave off an economic downturn.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the share of companies beating sales estimates also the weakest since 2019, Wall Street pros are wondering how much longer profit margins will remain resilient. Firms that disappoint on margins or forecasts are seeing their stocks punished: Tesla sank 12% on July 24 following its margin miss, while Super Micro Computer Inc. tanked 20% and Airbnb Inc. slumped 13% on Wednesday after their disappointments.\n\nBut for the most part, investors are being more forgiving than usual with stocks that miss estimates. For example, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. shares rallied 2.4% following an outlook cut that analysts said was largely expected. And Kraft Heinz Co. jumped 4.1% after slashing its annual organic sales target because investors were relieved that it wasn\u2019t projecting an even bigger decline.\n\nResilient Outlook\n\nDespite broader concerns about an economic contraction, Citigroup Inc. strategist Scott Chronert said his outlook for earnings this year hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cWe remain comfortable with our S&P 500 earnings projections, while acknowledging some risk should a traditional recession ensue,\u201d Chronert said. He added that the team\u2019s models show \u201ca high likelihood\u201d of roughly 10% profit growth in 2024 \u2014 with a further increase next year.\n\nAnalysts currently expect earnings to rise 8.5% in 2024 and 14.2% in 2025, according to data compiled by BI.\n\nThe effusiveness from Corporate America this quarter was notably absent from Europe, where the median stock in the Stoxx 600 Index that missed profit estimates underperformed the benchmark by 2.2%, the widest margin since at least 2016, figures from JPMorgan show. On the flip-side, stocks reporting better-than-expected earnings outperformed by only 1.6%.\n\n\u201cThe US investor is highly optimistic whereas the European investor tends to be relatively pessimistic,\u201d said Chris Hart, portfolio manager at Boston Partners. \u201cBut then you\u2019re paying a much higher multiple for that. Over the medium term, the pendulum starts to swing back to Europe, where you get to a point where valuations are very compelling.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Why Leaders Have a Hard Time Knowing When to Leave\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Recently falling to under $200 a share, Tesla\u2019s TSLA stock has dropped -20% over the last month after previously edging towards its 52-week high of $278.98 seen last September.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock had started to post a masterful rebound before its underwhelming Q2 report in July and the selloff afterward was extended by recent market volatility.\n\nInvestors may be wondering if Tesla's stock can get back to its recovery as the broader indexes stabilize. To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Performance Overview\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\n\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\n\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\n\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its 200-day SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw an increase in subscriptions of its full self driving software in the second quarter amid promotional offers and price cuts, with RBC analysts stating that a bigger cut in subscription prices could present a major upside for the stock.\n\nRBC noted that cumulative miles driven under Tesla\u2019s FSD software jumped 60% in the second quarter from the first, with the trend coming after a free trial in March and a price cut in the subscription to $99/month from $200/month.\n\nBut RBC noted that despite the increased usage, FSD penetration in Tesla\u2019s fleet remained in the single digits, much weaker than that seen with its peers.\n\nThe brokerage argued that if Tesla lowered the price of its FSD offering to compete better with its peers, it could \u201csignificantly increase\u201d FSD subscriptions.\n\n\u201cThis could translate to immediately improved margins and more importantly, highlight the autonomy narrative and multiple on Tesla shares instantly, instead of waiting for robotaxis. It could also highlight the potential for Tesla to license FSD to other OEMs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company could at any moment cut its FSD pricing, which we believe would be a critical catalyst for shares.\u201d\n\nStill, RBC cut its price target on Tesla to $224 from $227, citing a much weaker delivery growth forecast for 2025. This came after the EV maker clocked dismal earnings and deliveries in the second quarter, as it grappled with softer margins, increased competition and production disruptions.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has consistently touted the potential for FSD and robotaxis to become a major earnings driver. But FSD still remains a relatively niche product for Tesla, while the launch of its robotaxis was delayed to October from August.\n\nBeyond FSD and robotaxis, RBC said Tesla\u2019s energy storage revenues were set to pick up, while the firm was also set to benefit from higher regulatory credits.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock is nursing a nearly 23% tumble so far this year, as the stock was battered by falling deliveries, while a string of price cuts, amid increased competition in China, dented its margins.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla: FSD price cuts could be \u2018critical catalyst\u2019 for shares, RBC says\n\nUS judge tosses much of Mexico's lawsuit against US gun makers\n\nUS stock futures drift lower as rebound stalls, tech weakness persists\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla Stock (NASDAQ:TSLA): Here\u2019s Its Secret Growth Machine",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA), the leading EV maker in the United States, has a clean energy business that could become the company\u2019s secret growth machine in the next decade. Under this business segment (known as Energy Generation and Storage), Tesla sells energy storage products and solar energy systems to customers, capitalizing on the growing demand for renewable energy products.\n\nSince its founding in 2015, Tesla\u2019s energy business has grown into a $3 billion business today, and the company is aggressively expanding it in key global markets such as China to gain long-term competitive advantages on a global scale. I am bullish on the outlook for Tesla as I believe the company is well-positioned to grow in the next decade.\n\nThe Booming Energy Business\n\nIn Q2, Tesla\u2019s energy storage deployments reached an all-time high of 9.4 GWh, a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 158%. On the back of record deployments, Energy Generation and Storage revenue reached a new high of $3 billion compared to just $1.5 billion in Q2 2023. Meanwhile, the core EV business reported a revenue decline of 7% in Q2, which highlights the importance of the energy business at a time when macroeconomic pressures are limiting the growth of the EV segment.\n\nThe growing energy business is already helping Tesla\u2019s bottom line. In the second quarter, the gross profit margin of the energy segment expanded by more than 600 basis points YoY to 24.6%, while Automotive gross margins declined by 70 basis points to 18.5%. Even on an absolute basis, energy gross margins are way ahead of Automotive margins, which suggests the energy business is fundamentally more profitable compared to Tesla\u2019s core EV business. Q2 was the most profitable quarter for the energy business since its inception.\n\nA year ago, the energy business only accounted for 6% of total gross profits, but in Q2, the contribution from this segment rose to 16.3%. This is an encouraging sign, given the high profitability of this business segment.\n\nTesla is aggressively investing in its energy business to capitalize on the opportunity in renewables. During the Q2 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk claimed that the company is planning to ramp up production in the U.S. In addition, Tesla is building a Megapack factory in China to cater to the growing demand for energy storage systems. According to company executives, Tesla is on pace to at least double the energy storage capacity in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Big Picture Is Promising\n\nAccording to BloombergNEF, the global energy storage market tripled in 2023, with record global additions of 97 GWh in storage capacity. This year, global energy storage additions are expected to hit 100 GWh, building on the positive momentum from last year. BloombergNEF projects the global energy storage market to grow at a CAGR of 21% to 442 GWh by 2030. Continued adoption of renewable energy is at the center of these expectations.\n\nEnergy storage systems play a crucial role in supporting the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. They help balance the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources by helping consumers and energy producers store excess energy to be utilized when production falls below demand.\n\nAnalysts Are Betting Big on the Energy Business\n\nWall Street remains concerned about Tesla\u2019s growth prospects amid the slowdown in global EV sales, but some experts are banking on the energy segment to deliver outsized returns. For instance, Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, believes the energy segment will drive strong earnings growth for Tesla in the coming years. She even compared the energy segment to Amazon Web Services, which has been the key earnings driver for Amazon (AMZN) in recent years.\n\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Adam Jonas, after digesting Q2 earnings, raised Tesla\u2019s price target to $310, assigning the energy business a value of $50 per share, up from his earlier estimate of $36 per share. After boosting his estimates, the analyst commented that the energy business is a \u201cshow stealer.\u201d\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analysts also raised their full-year revenue estimates for Tesla on the back of the improving outlook for the energy business. Cantor analysts now expect energy storage deployments of 29 GWh in 2024, up substantially from the previous estimates of 16.3 GWh. Energy segment revenue is expected to hit $9.6 billion this year against previous expectations of $6.6 billion. Stifel and Baird analysts also commented positively on the outlook for Tesla\u2019s energy business following the strong second-quarter performance.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTesla stock has declined more than 16% this year amid EV price cuts, intensifying competition, elevated interest rates, inflationary pressures, and regulatory challenges. This lackluster market performance has brought Tesla\u2019s valuation to more reasonable grounds. Still, based on the ratings of 30 Wall Street analysts, Tesla stock earns a Hold consensus rating. The average Tesla stock price target is $213.92, which implies upside potential of 6.6% from the current market price.\n\nSee more TSLA analyst ratings\n\nBased on analyst projections, Tesla seems fairly valued today. Tesla has always enjoyed premium valuation multiples because of the company\u2019s long runway for growth. Today, at a forward P/E of 83x, Tesla is trading well below its five-year average multiples of close to 300x. Although Tesla may not be as cheaply valued as traditional automakers, the growing energy business, Tesla\u2019s dominance in the U.S. electric vehicle market, and the company\u2019s expansion into robotaxis justify its valuation today.\n\nThe Takeaway: Tesla Still Has a Lot to Offer\n\nTesla\u2019s energy business is proving to be a growth driver at a time when the company\u2019s core EV business is facing challenges. In the long run, both these business segments will contribute positively to growth, which justifies the company\u2019s premium valuation today. Analysts are also becoming bullish on the prospects for the energy business, which should lead to a meaningful hike in earnings estimates.\n\nThis is good news for Tesla, as positive earnings revisions often lead to stock market momentum. Despite short-term challenges, Tesla seems well-positioned to grow.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) energy business is expanding in Texas, partnering with solar and home energy infrastructure provider Sunrun (RUN) to help homeowners build \u201cvirtual power plants\u201d and make money in the process.\n\nIn a statement, Sunrun said it was partnering with Tesla subsidiary Tesla Electric, a retail electricity provider in Texas, in order to support the energy grid in Texas via Tesla Powerwall battery owners.\n\nTesla Electric is the company\u2019s retail electricity provider that gives owners of Tesla Powerwalls the option to let Tesla manage and adjust an owner\u2019s home energy system, either at home or through dispensing energy back to the grid. With the Tesla Electric service, Powerwall owners can optimize their earnings by selling back to the grid and sharing electricity with the community, in this case the Texas energy grid.\n\nCustomers will be compensated in the form of yearly payments, Sunrun said, currently calculated at $400 per Powerwall for 2024.\n\nSunrun stock jumped over 10% on news of the partnership.\n\nSunrun said the partnership with Tesla has enrolled more than 150 Sunrun customers in an \u201caggregated power program\u201d and will scale up using stored solar energy from at-home batteries to augment electricity reserves on the grid during peak consumption.\n\nSunrun uses other energy storage providers as well, but the company noted that Tesla Electric is a preferred provider for the service due to its rate structure for customers and \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d functionality, where clusters of Powerwall owners are aggregated virtually via software and batteries to create a power source capable of augmenting a larger electrical grid.

(Andrew Francis Wallace/Toronto Star via Getty Images) (Andrew Francis Wallace via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cTexas grid has already experienced a traumatic spring and summer due to weather vulnerabilities and we know the state also needs more power to meet soaring demand on a daily basis,\u201d said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell in a statement, noting that Texans are now increasingly adding batteries to their solar installations, like the ones Sunrun installs.\n\nTexas was slammed by Hurricane Beryl only a few weeks back, knocking out power to millions of consumers connected to Texas\u2019s troubled electrical grid, managed by local regulator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Beryl\u2019s destruction comes three years after a winter storm devastated Texas\u2019s grid, knocking out power for weeks during a bitterly cold winter.

(David Becker for the Washington Post) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nSince then, ERCOT has been experimenting with ways to augment its grid\u2019s resiliency, and distributed energy strategies like virtual power plants have been implemented.\n\nAdded Sunrun\u2019s Powell, \u201cOn-site energy storage not only provides homeowners peace of mind with outage protection but also enables them to participate in programs like these by contributing to solutions that better the lives of those in their communities.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla did not comment on news of the deal, but the company has noted the growth in its energy business. In its latest second quarter earnings report, the company said it deployed a record amount of battery storage, which was more than double Q1\u2019s total.\n\nWall Street analysts, including Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas, are bullish on Tesla Energy, one of the company\u2019s biggest growth drivers.\n\nJonas dubbed Tesla\u2019s Q2 energy deployment storage figure a \u201cshow stealer\u201d in a recent research report, noting the 9.4 GWh deployed was double the firm\u2019s forecast.\n\n\u201cWe believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the US electric grid accelerated by the AI boom,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Federal safety authorities say they are seeking information on a crash and fire involving a Tesla Cybertruck that killed a driver of the futuristic new pickup.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday it is gathering information from Tesla. The agency did not send crash investigators, nor has it opened a formal investigation into the crash. It did not say if it is investigating the cause of the fire or whether the driver was using a partially automated driving system.\n\nMessages were left Wednesday seeking comment from Tesla and the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nThe death apparently is the first involving the angular stainless steel-clad truck, which went on sale Nov. 30.\n\nKHOU-TV reported that state troopers are investigating the crash, which occurred in the Baytown area of Chambers County early Monday. The truck was heading down a parkway when it left the road for an unknown reason, hit a concrete culvert and went up in flames, the station reported.\n\nThe Cybertruck was recalled twice in June to fix problems with trim pieces that can come loose and front windshield wipers that can fail. It has been recalled four times since its introduction.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why this Tesla investor and Elon Musk supporter is buying the stock dip",
        "content": "Tesla's (TSLA) stock may be on the skids right now, but one perma bull considers the slide to be a perfect buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very convinced this [stock] goes to $5,000 or $10,000 [long-term] once people understand what Tesla is all about,\u201d retail investor and Tesla shareholder Alexandra Merz told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi for his Opening Bid podcast (See video above or listen in here).\n\nMerz is a former financial advisor and current CEO of L&F Investor Services, and no stranger to the electric vehicle (EV) space.\n\nSince 2014, she has enthusiastically been behind the wheels of various EVs. Of all the EVs she\u2019s come into contact with, her Teslas are all that and then some, she says. After test-driving a Model 3, she realized Tesla was more than just a car company \u2014 but also a tech play.\n\nShe began purchasing Tesla shares after liquidating other assets, and has since been a fierce advocate of the brand on Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter \u2014 where she can be found driving discussions on the brand to her more than 100,000 followers at the handle TeslaBoomerMama.\n\nTo Merz, Tesla's stock remains undervalued for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, the market is not properly pricing in the company's earning power from the widespread adoption of its Optimus humanoid robots over time. Although there are doubters on these robots, including former Meta head of AI Jerome Pesenti.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to call it what it is, right? I mean, have you seen this [robot] thing do anything? It's bulls**t,\" Pesenti said on Opening Bid.\n\nAnd two, Tesla's AI is a competitive advantage that can widen its moat versus car rivals such as General Motors (GM).\n\nIn the end, Merz thinks fellow Tesla bull Cathie Wood's $2,600 long-term price target on Teslas' stock (currently the most aggressive in the finance world) will prove conservative.\n\nDespite Tesla's alleged longer-term potential, investors like Merz are dealing with a different short-term reality.\n\nTesla's stock \u2014 often seen as riskier than the broader market \u2014 has been swept up into the recent tech meltdown.\n\nShares of the EV maker have tanked 20% in the past month, according to Yahoo Finance data. The S&P 500 has shed about 6% during that same stretch, with the Nasdaq Composite off by 11%.\n\nThe sell-off was triggered in part by the company's lackluster second quarter earnings report in late July, which included the promise of cheaper EVs in 2025.\n\n\"Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition. Meanwhile, valuation appears to be pricing in upside related to expansion into mass-market segments well beyond our volume forecasts for the Model 3,\" said JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman in a client note.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrinkman holds an underweight rating (sell equivalent) on Tesla's stock.\n\nFurther not helping sentiment on Tesla is the mercurial Musk.\n\nMusk continues to feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, again filing a lawsuit alleging that he was misled about OpenAI's mission as an early backer.\n\nOn the political front, Musk has backed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a noted critic of EVs.\n\nAnd, Tesla postponed its robotaxi event from mid-July to October 10, stirring speculation the unveiling could be a letdown.\n\nAs an enthusiastic investor, Merz is following this barrage of information but taking it with a grain of salt. She says buying Tesla's stock on its latest sell-off makes sense.\n\n\u201cAs any Tesla investor knows, we have our ups and downs because while we see the long-term vision, obviously, the day-to-day stock price can be fluctuating,\u201d Merz said.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s not \u201conly a car company, [it\u2019s an energy company and this whole tech company that\u2019s] going to bring us full self-driving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also going to bring us this whole real-life AI.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Elon Musk\u2019s backing of Donald Trump is hurting Tesla\u2019s struggling EV business in Europe",
        "content": "Elon Musk has never shied away from controversy\u2014whether that\u2019s on AI\u2019s threat to society, reinstating once-banned X (formerly Twitter) accounts, or, more recently, his endorsement of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nWhile many of Musk\u2019s controversial thoughts eventually fizzle out, his support for Trump is having a tangible impact on his EV company, Tesla, in Europe.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rossmann, one of Europe\u2019s largest drugstore chains, said it was suspending Tesla vehicle purchases \u201cwith immediate effect.\u201d\n\nIts reason? Musk\u2019s vocal support of Trump.\n\n\"Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla's mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars,\" Raoul Ro\u00dfmann, Rossmann\u2019s spokesman for the management, said in a statement. KRAKOW, POLAND - 2018/03/19: Rossman store in Galeria Krakowska. (Photo by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nThirty-four of Rossmann\u2019s 800 vehicles are Teslas, the company\u2019s spokesperson told Fortune. The company plans to continue using those vehicles for \u201csustainability and resource conservation.\u201d\n\nRossmann is the first major business to cite Musk\u2019s political stance as a reason to halt future Tesla purchases. Other European companies have dropped orders from Tesla for different reasons. For instance, software giant SAP said it would stop offering Teslas as company cars for employees as Musk\u2019s numerous price cuts add uncertainties, unlike other car makers.\n\nCloser to home, Hertz, a Florida-based car rental company, is reeling from its big (bad) bet on Tesla, resulting in it offloading tens of thousands of the company\u2019s vehicles. European leasing companies have faced a similar predicament, forcing Tesla to offer unofficial discounts to mollify them.\n\nThe European EV market is far larger than that in the U.S., but demand has slumped owing to strong competition and fewer subsidies. That\u2019s hurt Tesla significantly, as the region\u2019s largest countries have reported sharp drops in sales for the first seven months of the year.\n\nThe Musk dilemma\n\nWhere Musk stands on the broader debate surrounding clean technology is still unclear. Musk\u2019s companies have pioneered the scale-up of EVs, which are seen as a novel alternative to fossil fuel-powered vehicles and a key step towards a green transition. For that reason, the world\u2019s richest man is regarded as somewhat of a hero\u2014depending on who you ask.\n\nBut the billionaire, a self-proclaimed environmentalist, has also said that the \u201cclimate change alarm is exaggerated in the short term\u201d in December. Not to forget, Musk is also an avid private jet user, making him a big polluter personally.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the European drug chain highlighted, Musk\u2019s support for Trump can seem like a stark contrast given Tesla\u2019s focus on electric cars. The SpaceX CEO has spoken about a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect a Trump presidency might have on the EV market\u2014including on Tesla.\n\nStill, Musk\u2019s support doesn\u2019t stop at his endorsement of Trump. He created a political action committee (PAC) that backs the former president, although the amount he is donating is still disputed. The PAC is now being investigated over data fraud concerns.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments in the past have been at odds with Tesla\u2019s business. The Republican nominee once said EVs would \u201cdestroy the country\u201d and \u201ccost too much.\u201d But since Musk pledged support for him, Trump said he has \u201cno choice\u201d but to be on team EVs.\n\nWith just months to go before the U.S. election, the story of how Musk\u2019s political stance affects his businesses\u2014in and out of America\u2014could continue to unfold.\n\nRepresentatives at Tesla didn\u2019t return Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors are rushing out of electric vehicle-focused funds as growth forecasts cool and with a potential reelection of Donald Trump seen posing a further challenge to profits.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure New York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk Singer Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice Paris Spent \u20ac1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\n\nEV funds tracked by data provider EPFR Global had combined net outflows of $1.6 billion this year to July 31, more than the total redemptions in 2023. The funds saw inflows in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe EV trade has become an anti-Trump trade,\u201d said Vicki Chi, a portfolio manager at Robeco in Hong Kong, who manages funds that don\u2019t have exposure to pure-play EV producers. \u201cDespite the fact that you see more and more EVs on the road, very few companies are making money and very few companies have an outlook of expanding margins.\u201d\n\nEven after winning the backing of Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, Trump has criticized incentives to support the wide adoption of electric models, insisting they\u2019ll be a \u201csmall slice\u201d of the market, alongside gas-powered vehicles and hybrids.\n\nTrump has vowed to ditch some existing electric car policies if he returns to office, and to extend tariffs on Chinese EV imports to as much as 200%. Those moves threaten to exacerbate concerns over a slowdown in EV sales growth that\u2019s already causing investors to manufacturers to reassess their outlook on the technology.\n\nTax credits added under the Inflation Reduction Act could be rolled back and federal funding for EVs and related infrastructure removed, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Bill Peterson wrote in a report last week.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t go far, they cost too much and they\u2019re all made in China \u2014 other than that they are fantastic,\u201d Trump said last week at a rally in Atlanta. \u201cAnd I\u2019m for electric cars. I have to be because, you know, Elon endorsed me very strongly.\u201d\n\nFunds in China, the largest EV market, saw almost $500 million in redemptions in the first half, according to EPFR data tracking about $6.5 billion in assets. Products in the US, South Korea and Japan were among those to also record net outflows in the second quarter.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. last month trimmed its holding in Shenzhen-based BYD Co., which vies with Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest electric automaker, to less than 5% from more than 20% two years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe removal of US subsidies by Trump would have \u201csome impact\u201d on Tesla, and \u201cwould be devastating for our competitors,\u201d Musk said last month, as the automaker posted another quarter of disappointing profits. Rivals including Volkswagen AG reported weaker operating margins, in part on declining demand.\n\nFord Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG have revised down forecasts on EV growth too, while Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche AG has shifted away from a target for electric models to account for 80% of new-vehicle sales in 2030.\n\nBYD and rival Chinese automakers face additional tariffs in the US and European Union that threaten their global expansion amid a fierce domestic price war that\u2019s eroding profitability.\n\n\u201cGrowth in end demand or in market share is far from a guarantee of profit growth,\u201d said London-based Raj Shant, a client portfolio manager at Jennison Associates, a firm which benefited from an early bet on Tesla. \u201cThat, after all, is what drives share prices.\u201d\n\nEV sales, including plug-in hybrids, are set to rise from 13.9 million last year to more than 30 million in 2027, according to BloombergNEF\u2019s Economic Transition Scenario, a base case forecast that assumes global efforts to hit net zero only on technologies that are currently economic.\n\nUnder that trajectory, average annual sales growth for EVs would slow to 21% through 2027, compared with 61% between 2020 and 2023.\n\n--With assistance from Jeffrey Hernandez.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too How a Hip-Hop Pioneer Turned Breaking Into a Business Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest Retailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 largest automotive markets in the world. You can skip our detailed discussion of the current state of the auto market and see the 5 Largest Automotive Markets in the World here.\n\nThe Global Automotive Industry: A Brief Overview\n\nProviding millions of jobs and supporting numerous sectors, the global automotive industry plays a crucial role in the global economy. According to a report by Towards Automotive, the global automotive industry was estimated to have reached a value of $4.07 trillion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.66% from 2024 to 2032 to reach a value of $6.67 trillion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe global automotive industry has experienced significant shifts in recent years, driven by the rapid adoption of fuel-efficient cars and electric vehicles. China is heavily investing in electric vehicle (EV) production. From 2009 to 2023, the Chinese government has invested a total of $230.8 billion to support the growth and development of its electric vehicle industry, as revealed by an analysis published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nChinese electric vehicle manufacturers are emerging as significant global players, challenging automakers around the world. These Chinese companies are shaking up the competitive landscape, both within China and globally, by offering affordable and technologically advanced electric vehicles. On April 3, Bloomberg reported that Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing significant challenges in China, the largest EV market, due to intense competition from local rivals. The company\u2019s market share in China has shrunk from 10.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to around 6.7% in the fourth quarter, ending in December 2023. Chinese EV makers like BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) are offering newer models with more advanced features compared to Tesla, Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) relatively unchanged Model 3 and Model Y. BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), in particular, has a wide range of vehicles catering to different price points. At the more affordable end, it offers the Seagull hatchback, which features a 10-inch rotating touchscreen and is priced under $10,000. On the higher end, BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594) has the Yangwang U8 plug-in hybrid SUV, which boasts an impressive 1,200 horsepower, can float on water, and can perform a 360-degree \"tank turn\".\n\nThe transition to EVs may also start gaining significant momentum in the US. On June 7, The New York Times reported that the Biden administration has unveiled new fuel efficiency standards as part of its strategy to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles in the US. The Transportation Department's regulations require American automakers to improve the average fuel economy of their passenger cars to 65 miles per gallon by 2031, up from the current 48.7 miles per gallon. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recently introduced strict new limits on tailpipe emissions, aiming to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the US by 2032 are electric or hybrid vehicles. American automakers will be looking to increase both the number of all-electric and hybrid vehicles they sell, as well as improve the fuel efficiency of their conventional cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Look at General Motors Company\u2019s EV Ambitions\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company that ranks high among the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturers by revenue. The company is focused on advancing an all-electric future by leveraging its Ultium battery platform to power a diverse range of electric vehicles, from mass-market to high-performance models. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), its subsidiaries, and its joint venture entities market vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun, and Wuling brands. GM is one of the best car stocks to buy right now.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is making significant progress in its EV business, ramping up production and improving profitability. In its Q1 2024 earnings report, the company reported that it has increased its battery module production by 300% over the past six months. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is on track to double its current EV production capacity by the end of the summer. GM's EV sales have also seen a sharp rise, with a 21% year-over-year increase in retail customer deliveries. The all-electric Cadillac LYRIQ, for instance, outsold all European luxury brand EVs in the first quarter of 2024. Since mid-March, GM has also been delivering the Chevrolet Blazer EV with updated and improved software, benefiting from the company's focus on end-to-end software improvements.\n\nLooking ahead, the Chevrolet Equinox EV is expected to arrive in showrooms in the second quarter of 2024 as the most affordable long-range EV in the US. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also plans to introduce more affordable trim levels for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Silverado EV in the second half of 2024, aiming to drive volume and market share growth. GM also aims to expand its Cadillac EV lineup with the OPTIQ and Escalade IQ later this year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2024, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and its joint ventures delivered more than 441,000 vehicles in China. This included a significant increase of 42.6% in sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), reaching a record high of more than 128,000 units. GM plans to launch a record number of NEV models in 2024 in China, leveraging a combination of global and local solutions, including new plug-in hybrid technologies, to cater to the diverse needs of consumers.\n\nNow that we have discussed what\u2019s going on in the automotive industry, let\u2019s take a look at the 20 largest automotive markets in the world. 20 Largest Automotive Markets in the World\n\nAn auto warehouse filled with newly acquired used cars.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article, we compiled a list of the 20 largest automotive markets in the world.

        "title": "Why Is Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER) the Best Travel and Leisure Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Travel and Leisure Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other travel and leisure stocks.\n\nPrior to COVID-19 pandemic, travel and tourism sector was one of the most important sectors in the world economy. The sector made up ~10% of global GDP and was responsible for 320 million jobs worldwide, as reported by the IMF. After first case was identified in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic outbreak. Due to lockdowns and ban on international travel, global hospitality and tourism sector saw significant losses.\n\nRecovery Phase of The Industry\n\nAs per first UNWTO World Tourism Barometer of the year, international tourism closed 2023 at ~88% of pre-pandemic levels, with estimated ~1.3 billion international arrivals. UNWTO World Tourism Barometer gives a brief overview of the sector's performance in 2023, assessing recovery by global region, sub-region and destination. The Middle East led this recovery in relative terms. It was the only region to overcome pre-pandemic levels as the region saw arrivals 22% above 2019. Europe touched 94% of 2019 levels, aided by intra-regional demand along with travel from the US.\n\nExperts believe that stage is all set for resilience and rapid recovery of travel and tourism sector, with pre-pandemic numbers anticipated by 2024 end. Rebound is having a solid impact on several economies, jobs, growth and opportunities for communities.\n\nDespite a range of economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, the travel & tourism sector continues to thrive. International tourism flows bounced back at a strong pace and should fully recover by 2024 end. That being said, recovery remained uneven, and challenges still remain.\n\nAfter declining ~68.3% in 2020 \u2013 which was marginally below the drop of ~72.3% globally \u2013 by 2022-end, international tourist arrivals to OECD countries recovered to ~77.3% of 2019 levels. This was ahead of ~66.6% globally. OECD countries made up ~65% of international tourism arrivals in 2022, exhibiting a rise from ~56% in 2019. This highlighted stronger performance as compared to non-OECD countries since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2023 built the momentum, and evidenced that there is still an unwavering passion for travel. This paves the way for a strong year in 2024.\n\nFuture Prospects of Travel and Tourism Industry\n\nThe World Travel & Tourism Council expects record-breaking year for travel & tourism sector in 2024. Data suggests that the sector\u2019s global economic contribution is expected to touch all-time high of $11.1 trillion. Travel & Tourism should be able to make additional contribution of $770 billion over the previous record. This will help the industry regain its stature of global economic powerhouse. By 2034, travel and tourism is expected to account for ~11.4% of the entire economic landscape, with the contribution as high as $16 trillion to broader global economy.\n\nTourism and hospitality is on the cusp of disruption. Shift in source markets and destinations, higher demand for luxury traveling, and innovative business strategies are expected to improve the industry landscape.\n\nAs per McKinsey & Company, China\u2019s $744 billion domestic travel market has been categorized as the world\u2019s 2nd largest. Even after the opening up of borders, Chinese travellers prefer staying close to home. Resultantly, domestic destinations continue to benefit. Changchun (known for Changchun Ice and Snow Festival) saw 160% year over year growth in visitors in 2023. In 2024, domestic travel during Lunar New Year surpassed pre-pandemic levels by ~19%. As a result of this, some Chinese travel and tourism stocks saw their share prices move northwards.\n\nChina\u2019s domestic travel market should grow by ~12% annually and surpass the United States\u2019 to be counted as the world\u2019s largest by the year 2030.\n\nOne of the signs of increased demand in the travel industry is growth in aircraft orders in the aerospace industry. We covered this back in July in 10 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Now, here's a short excerpt from that article:\n\n\"While sharing his insights on commercial aviation at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago on June 26, Tony Bancroft from Gabelli Funds said that he had noticed a significant growth in aircraft orders lately, with both Airbus and Boeing having a 12-year backlog of orders. He believes there are three reasons driving it. The first catalyst, according to him, is China which accounts for 20% of the growth in orders to cater to the growing middle class in both China and India who want to travel more. Another critical factor he cited during his talk was that business travel has finally returned to the 2019 pre-pandemic level. Lastly, Tony highlighted the rising middle class in the United States, and the world, which is increasing air travel and contributing to the economic growth in the industry.\"\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we sifted through 2 ETFs i.e., Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF and Amplify Travel Tech ETF. Then, we chose the companies with most hedge fund investors holding stakes in them, by using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q1 2024 database. These stocks are in ascending order of hedge fund investors having positions in them.\n\n\u201cWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\u201d\n\nA close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 130\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a technology provider, matching riders with drivers, hungry people with restaurants and food delivery service providers and shippers with carriers.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock was recently covered by numerous research analysts. DA Davidson initiated the coverage on shares of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and reaffirmed \u201cBuy\u201d rating. The brokerage gave a $81.00 price objective on the company\u2019s shares on 8th May. Piper Sandler increased their price target on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) from $86.00 to $88.00, giving the stock \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 25th June.\n\nThe company announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Its gross bookings went up by ~20% YoY to $37.7 billion, or 21% on the constant currency basis. Mobility Gross Bookings came in at $18.7 Bn, reflecting 25% growth YoY or 26% growth on constant currency basis.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has recently been in the news after reports surfaced that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) pushed back\u00a0its big robotaxi event. Mr. Musk announced that it plans to postpone a planned event from August to October.\n\nPlans for potential autonomous robotaxi service from Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have impacted share prices of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) since April 2024.\n\nAt the end of 1Q 2024, 130 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). These stakes have a consolidated value of ~$10.18 million.\n\nRiverPark Advisors, an investment advisory firm, released its 1Q 2024 investor letter and mentioned about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Here is what the company said:\n\n\u201cUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 4Q23 earnings and 1Q24 guidance. Gross bookings of $37.6 billion were up 22% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $19.3 billion grew 29% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $17 billion were up 19% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion, up $618 million year over year, was better than management\u2019s guidance of $1.2 billion, and the company generated $768 million of free cash flow, up from a cash loss of $303 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q Gross Bookings (20% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.3 billion). The company hosted a well-received analyst day in February during which it guided to three year compounded annual growth rates for gross bookings of mid-to-high single digits and EBITDA of 30-40%, both above investor expectations. The company also guided to free cash flow conversion of 90% of EBITDA.\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.4 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.8 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $165 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year\u2019s free cash flow.\u201d\n\nOverall UBER ranks 1st on our list of the best travel and leisure stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Travel and Leisure Stocks to Buy Nowto see the other travel and leisure stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA andJim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Sunrun and Tesla Partner to Support Texas Power Grid Using Residential Solar-Plus-Battery Systems",
        "content": "Sunrun Inc.\n\nSunrun partners with retail electricity provider Tesla Electric to create a customer-driven power plant in Texas using customers\u2019 solar-plus-battery systems\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrun (Nasdaq: RUN), the nation\u2019s leading provider of clean energy as a subscription service, announced today that it has expanded its support for the energy grid in Texas with a partnership with Tesla Electric, a retail electricity provider operated by Tesla Energy Ventures LLC, a subsidiary of Tesla, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA). The partnership has already enrolled more than 150 Sunrun customers in an aggregated power program and will scale up enrollments while dispatching stored solar energy from at-home batteries to rapidly increase available electricity reserves on the grid during periods of high consumption.\n\nThe ongoing partnership marks Sunrun\u2019s first operational aggregated power plant program in the Lone Star State and comes just weeks after Hurricane Beryl caused widespread power outages impacting nearly 3 million homes and businesses. It also comes three years after the state\u2019s devastating and deadly power grid meltdown during the winter storm in February 2021. Since both catastrophic events, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state\u2019s grid operator, has begun adopting ways to diversify and strengthen the power grid, including through the Aggregated Distributed Energy Resources Task Force.\n\n\u201cTexas grid has already experienced a traumatic spring and summer due to weather vulnerabilities and we know the state also needs more power to meet soaring demand on a daily basis. We\u2019re eager to bring Sunrun\u2019s on-demand battery response expertise to help make the grid more resilient against outages,\u201d said Sunrun CEO Mary Powell. \u201cTexas families are increasingly opting to add batteries to their solar installations. On-site energy storage not only provides homeowners peace of mind with outage protection but also enables them to participate in programs like these by contributing to solutions that better the lives of those in their communities.\u201d\n\nSevere weather events and soaring electricity demands in Texas highlight the importance of solar-plus-battery systems for residents seeking greater control, energy security, and independence. Sunrun will enhance these benefits through its partnership with Tesla Electric by enabling residents to receive compensation for sharing energy from their Tesla Powerwall batteries to help stabilize the electric grid for all Texans.\n\nSunrun customers who enroll will be participating in ERCOT\u2019s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resources pilot program aimed at strengthening grid reliability by networking together customer-sited storage devices to serve as a resource for the wholesale electricity market. Additionally, customer Powerwall batteries will also help to lower the costs of energy at the wholesale level. The resulting energy cost savings will be shared with customers.\n\nCustomers will be compensated for their participation in the form of yearly payments, currently calculated at $400 per Powerwall for 2024 participation. In addition, customers will retain a portion of the stored energy in their batteries to provide back-up power to their homes in the event of a power outage. Sunrun will also earn incremental recurring revenue for the program.\n\nTesla Electric is one of Sunrun\u2019s preferred Retail Electricity Providers for Sunrun customers in Texas because of its attractive rate structures and ability to participate in this power plant program. Sunrun customers with solar panels combined with a Tesla Powerwall battery are eligible to participate once they choose Tesla Electric as their electricity provider.\n\nWith nearly one million customers and more than 116,000 installed storage systems, Sunrun has a proven track record of incentivizing customers to support local power grids. Sunrun currently operates more than a dozen power plants across the country, including the largest single-owner virtual power plant program.\n\nAbout Sunrun\r\nSunrun Inc. (Nasdaq: RUN) revolutionized the solar industry in 2007 by removing financial barriers and democratizing access to locally-generated, renewable energy. Today, Sunrun is the nation\u2019s leading provider of clean energy as a subscription service, offering residential solar and storage with no upfront costs. Sunrun\u2019s innovative products and solutions can connect homes to the cleanest energy on earth, providing them with energy security, predictability, and peace of mind. Sunrun also manages energy services that benefit communities, utilities, and the electric grid while enhancing customer value.

The posts eventually caught the eye of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who personally stepped in to address the issue and promised Lamar a replacement truck.\n\nWe'll get it fixed pronto\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2024\n\nSee Also: Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nUnfortunately, Lamar\u2019s replacement Cybertruck also had issues similar to what many other owners experienced. Common problems include unintended acceleration, faulty windshield wipers, and rapid battery drain. Cybertruck\u2019s stainless steel body also needs vinyl wrapping because paint doesn\u2019t stick to it, and the advanced steer-by-wire system has also been problematic.\n\nAfter wrapping it in blue for a few thousand extra dollars and going on vacation, Lamar returned to find the truck completely unresponsive. \"It was just this giant brick in my garage,\" he said. This led him to post about the issues again on Musk\u2019s social media platform to prove he wasn't just seeking attention.\n\nThis is my second Cybertruck. I've only driven this one for about a week since I've had it because I was on vacation for 3 weeks. I've only managed to drive it for a day and a half since I returned, it only has 800 miles on it. I'm really hoping this is an easy fix!\r\n\r\nI think... https://t.co/nqdDFGmmxdpic.twitter.com/dtSrGMLA2D\n\n\u2014 Lamar MK (@LamarMK) July 1, 2024\n\nTrending: When today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough initially happy, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the truck might fail again, especially if he were somewhere remote.\n\nSome people and influencers love the Cybertruck, but Lamar\u2019s experience shows the problems Tesla is having as it tries to innovate with electric cars. Early buyers have pointed out some serious quality issues that Tesla needs to fix.\n\nHowever, not everyone is impressed with the Cybertruck. Many people think it's a risky or downright ridiculous and unsafe design that focuses on \u201cstyle\u201d instead of practicality. There are also many doubts about how well it performs and holds up in real-world situations, to say the least.\n\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Lamar remains hopeful that Tesla will improve the Cybertruck\u2019s reliability. \"I just want Tesla to be better,\" he said, explaining his decision to speak out.\n\nTesla has been ramping up production of the Cybertruck, and it has become one of the top electric pickups in the U.S. market, surpassing competitors like the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning.\n\nLamar\u2019s persistence paid off. After plenty of back-and-forth with the company, he eventually got a working Cybertruck. He\u2019s now happy with his vehicle and has no regrets about sticking with Tesla.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.

        "content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugstore chain Rossmann said on Tuesday it would no longer buy Tesla cars for its corporate fleet due to CEO Elon Musk's support for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe drugstore chain, which is among the largest in Europe, said its decision was with immediate effect and due to what it called an \"incompatibility\" between statements by Musk and the values that Tesla represents.\n\n\"Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax - this stance is in stark contrast to Tesla's mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars,\" said Raoul Rossmann, the son of Rossmann's founder.\n\nMusk, Tesla and the Trump campaign had no immediate comment.\n\nMusk's stance on issues has in the past led companies to drop their advertising on his social media platform X, prompting a fierce rebuke from the billionaire.\n\nRossmann, with more than 62,000 employees and more than 4,700 stores in Germany and other European countries, said it would continue to use the Teslas it already owns \"for reasons of sustainability and resource conservation\".\n\nIt did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the size of its corporate fleet, or the number of Teslas it uses. Bloomberg reported that the company has 34 Teslas among its 800 cars.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Sims; Additional reporting by Hyun Joo Jin and Nathan Lane; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Stock Reports for Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla &amp; Visa",
        "content": "Tuesday, August 6, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Visa Inc. (V), as well a micro-cap stock AXIL Brands, Inc. (AXIL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+16.5% vs. +15.4%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. \r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. \r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Tesla have modestly outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past six months (+4.9% vs. +2.0%). The company has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market. \r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture. \r\n\r\nThe expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nVisa shares have gained +6.8% over the past year against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry\u2019s gain of +8.3%. The company\u2019s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. \r\n\r\nVisa, fueled by persistent increase in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. \r\n\r\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect adjusted operating expenses to jump 10.1% in fiscal 2024. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AXIL Brands\u2019 have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry over the past year (-61.6% vs. -12.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $27.98 million is witnessing rising operating expenses and declining gross profit margins signal profitability challenges. Inventory management issues and high customer concentration risks add to the concerns. \r\n\r\nIncreased accounts payable and reduced cash flow from operating activities highlight cash flow volatility. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, AXIL is expanding globally, diversifying revenue streams across the United States, Canada, the EU and Asia. \r\n\r\nStrategic initiatives, such as the NASCAR-branded hearing protection product deal with Racing Electronics and a distribution agreement with Kinsey\u2019s, boost market penetration. The strategic share repurchases in March 2024, reducing outstanding shares by 55%, enhance shareholder value. Third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue growth of 14.4% shows effective sales strategies and business expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AXIL Brands here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Morgan Stanley (MS), The Southern Company (SO) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Zeekr is using the Walker S Lite robot to automate simple manual tasks in its Hangzhou Bay factory - Peng Peng, Ni Yanqiang/Zhejiang Daily Press Group/VCG via Getty Images\n\nA Chinese luxury electric car maker has deployed humanoid robots in its factories for the first time in a blow to Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to make Tesla a global leader in the technology.\n\nZeekr, which is owned by Chinese automotive giant Geely, has begun experimenting with the \u201cWalker S Lite\u201d robot, which resembles a human and can perform basic tasks.\n\nA slick video on social media shows the two-legged robot, made by Shenzhen-based UBtech Robotics, moving boxes around the carmaker\u2019s \u201cintelligent factory\u201d in China\u2019s Hangzhou Bay region.\n\nThe robot is shown loading small pallets onto a conveyor below, which UBtech said it had done for 21 consecutive days, showing how it can assist \u201cemployees with logistics works\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen welcomed to the Zeekr factory by an employee, the robot replies \u201cI will do my best\u201d, before it is seen carrying boxes weighing as much as 15kg across the factory, walking in a human-like manner.\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nAlongside Zeekr, Geely controls British brand Lotus and has a stake in Aston Martin. It also owns the London EV Company, which manufactures London\u2019s iconic black cabs.\n\nThe footage from its factory comes a month after billionaire Mr Musk said Tesla would begin producing and using humanoid robots from 2025.\n\n\u201cTesla will have genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year and, hopefully, high production for other companies in 2026,\u201d Mr Musk recently wrote on X.\n\nThe Tesla chief executive has previously said the number of two-legged robots on Earth would one day surpass the 8bn humans on the planet.\n\nHe first announced plans to produce a 170cm-tall droid designed to do \u201cboring, repetitious and dangerous\u201d work in 2021.\n\nIn December, Tesla debuted a new version of its humanoid robot that could squat without falling over and pick up an egg without breaking it.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "When there's a market deluge, Cathie Wood is there trying to catch the drops in a bucket. The co-founder, CEO, and stock picker at Ark Invest had one of her busiest days of trading on Monday, when the market was plummeting. She added to two dozen of her existing positions, taking advantage of the lower entry points. Will her strategy work?\n\nWood kicked off the new trading week by building up her stakes in Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA), and Tempus (NASDAQ: TEM). The shares fell 2% to 4% on Monday as part of the larger market sell-off. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThe leading online retailer's 4% decline on Monday wasn't pleasant for shareholders, but the past few weeks haven't been a pleasure cruise, either. Amazon has now fallen 20% since hitting an all-time high last month.\n\nThe larger drop came on Friday of last week. Amazon stock fell 9% after the company posted poorly received financial results. Earnings per share nearly doubled to $1.26 in the second quarter, well ahead of the $1.03 analysts were targeting. There wasn't a lot of surprise behind the surprise, as Amazon has topped Wall Street profit targets by a double-digit percentage in each of the past four quarters. Unfortunately for Amazon, that was pretty much the only good news in last week's update.\n\nRevenue rose 10% to $148 billion for the three months ending in June, just shy of analyst expectations. A 19% jump in its buoyant Amazon Web Services segment was weighed down by a 9% increase in North American e-commerce sales and a 7% gain for its smaller international business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon's outlook is also a sore spot for the market. It sees net sales rising 8% to 11% in the the third quarter. The midpoint is below the nearly 11% year-over-year jump Wall Street pros were targeting. Amazon also sees its operating income growth slowing substantially from previous quarters.\n\nThe stock is intriguing here. Revenue growth is slowing. This is shaping up to be the third consecutive year of top-line growth of less than 12%, the three worst years of its 27-year trading history. Amazon is feeling pretty mortal now. It's facing Chinese e-commerce players that are growing quickly, and brick-and-mortar chains are getting smarter about drumming up digital sales. A potential recession won't help, either.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, bottom-line forecasts keep inching higher. Amazon's shrinking price finds it trading at 34 times this year's projected earnings and less than 28 times next year's estimate. These are rich multiples for an e-commerce company growing net sales at a much slower and slowing pace. However, Amazon deserves a rich market multiple given its dominant market position and its high-margin AWS business.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Tesla Motors\n\nTesla is the largest holding of Wood's largest fund, accounting for 14% of the assets of the Ark Innovation ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKK). With Tesla shares down 20% so far this year, they're playing a role in why Ark Innovation is losing to the market for the third time in the past four years.\n\nThere are growth challenges for Tesla right now. Revenue rose just 2% in its latest quarter, and that was with its energy generation and storage business doubling over the past year. Its flagship auto segment saw its sales dip 7%. A 5% decline in vehicle deliveries and lower average selling prices resulted in a much bigger hit on overall profitability.\n\nTesla remains the leader in its niche. Some of the more aggressive growth models may need to be pared back, particularly those that assumed the prices for Tesla vehicles and premium offerings like its full-self driving platform have moved lower, not higher, over the past year. Is Tesla a richly valued automaker or a bargain tech company? Wood would agree with the latter, and it's why she was a buyer on Monday.\n\n3. Tempus AI\n\nSome IPOs are more volatile than others, and Tempus AI has been a bucking bronco since going public in mid-June. The stock has traded as low as $22.89 a week after its market debut. It peaked at $47.09 just last week. It's now trading near its original IPO price of $37.\n\nTempus AI isn't short on ambition. It's working on practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Its goal is to improve the treatment and outcome of patients using generative AI to deliver intelligent diagnostics. Nearly two-thirds of U.S. academic medical centers and half of oncologists are now connected to Tempus AI.\n\nYou won't have to wait long to check out Tempus AI's first quarter as a public company. It will announce fresh financials after Tuesday's market close.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "This Energy Company Just Made A Big HQ Move, Time To Invest In Houston?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe departure of large businesses from California to Texas has been one of the evolving news stories over the last several years. Elon Musk moved Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Austin and may now move his other companies, including Space X and X. Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) left San Francisco for Austin in 2021. According to one estimate, over 70 businesses left California for Austin between 2018 and 2023.\n\nBut Austin isn't the only draw in Texas. Houston has been capturing increasing attention with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) opening a massive campus in 2022. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Houston had the second-biggest population increase in the country in 2022-2023. It's also one of the cities where new home construction is booming.\n\nCheck it out: Earn potential monthly cash flow from Sunbelt real estate with just $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThe Oil Town Keeps Booming\n\nHouston is known for the nexus of Big Oil; 44 of the nation's 113 publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production firms call it home. Now, one of the biggest is making an official move to the area. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is relocating to Houston from San Ramon, CA. Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth and Vice Chairman Mark Nelson will move to Houston before the end of 2024. Chevron already has around 7,000 employees in Houston and only around 2,000 in San Ramon. The company has said it won\u2019t require all employees in San Ramon to relocate to Houston immediately. The City of San Ramon issued a statement that said Chevron would continue to maintain a presence in the local economy from its current office space in San Ramon even with the transition in headquarters. Chevron says all corporate functions are expected to be in Houston over the next five years.\n\nThe Houston move isn\u2019t entirely out of the blue. In 2022, Chevron announced it was selling Chevron Park, its 92-acre campus in San Ramon. That complex has 13 buildings and over 1.3 million square feet of space. At that time, the company said it would move to a smaller space in San Ramon and move some employees to Houston. The project was bought by Sunset Development for an undisclosed sum. Plans surfaced last year to turn the campus into a mixed-use development called The Orchards, which would have nearly 3,000 homes, parks, and retail space.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nChevron has plenty of room in Houston. In 2011, it paid $340 million for Enron's former headquarters. The 40-story tower at 1500 Louisiana Street was designed by architect Cesar Pelli & Associates and has 1.3 million square feet of space. The former Enron complex also includes 1400 Smith Street, a 50-story tower built in 1983.\n\nBy 2035, Houston could be the third-largest city in the United States, outpacing Chicago. For those looking to get a slice of this growing market, one option for fractional real estate investors is Cityfunds by Nada, which recently opened one of its popular Cityfund investments in Houston. The Houston Cityfund is a chance to participate in the city\u2019s burgeoning growth, which is not just about energy but education, tech, and much more. The Cityfund targets prime real estate in Houston through a portfolio of owner-occupied homes, enabling anyone to own fractional shares of top-tier homes in Houston.\n\nWhile Chevron's move to Houston wasn't a big surprise, it is a reminder of the power of hubs of industry-specific talent. Although many people work remotely, companies are signaling that being located where the action is for their particular industry can be powerful. Texas's business-friendly policies continue to attract companies of all sorts.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Shares look set to open about 2.8% higher later on Tuesday.\n\nThe rollercoaster for shareholders has come in a week where it emerged there are some engineering issues with its latest AI chip. Reports last week from The Information said that the company had uncovered design flaws \"unusually late\" in the production process.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London and European stocks higher as Nikkei rebounds\n\nAI chips have made Nvidia one of the most valuable companies in the world, and the B200 chip was set to be an extension of that \u2014 the next generation of the H100 chips that power much of the world of AI cloud computing.\n\nPalantir (PLTR)\n\nPalantir stock was up more than 11% in premarket trade as the company raised its annual outlook in its earnings report, citing continued demand for AI software.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRevenue guidance for 2024 increased to a range of $2.74bn (\u00a32.15bn) to $2.75bn, while analysts had expected $2.7bn, according to Bloomberg data. It also upped its outlook for adjusted operating income to $966m to $974m for the year, above the expected $882.9m. Sales and net income also beat expectations.\n\nA brainchild of Peter Thiel in 2003, Palantir provides data analysis tools to companies and governments. Its software is used across the US military and has been used in furthering AI capabilities.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nEV maker Tesla saw its stock regain some ground in premarket on Tuesday, having dipped a full 4.2% on Monday amid market turmoil.\n\nThe moves lower came as CEO Elon Musk ramped up his feud with LLM darling OpenAI, filing a lawsuit against the company and its creator Sam Altman alleging he was misled in how the company had presented itself as a nonprofit.\n\nThe complaint, filed in US District Court in Northern California, says Musk invested tens of millions of dollars and sourced leading AI scientists off the back of that claim. It added that Altman was playing out a \"long con\" and \"hot-air philanthropy\" in representing the company as nonprofit.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe lawsuit is similar to a complaint filed by Musk in March, which alleged the company had broken its founding agreement \u2014 that lawsuit was withdrawn in June.\n\nStock in Tesla was trading around 2% by mid-morning in London.\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nProperty platform Rightmove was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Tuesday, as it announced it would end its partnership with Openrent.\n\nOpenrent is a platform where landlords can list properties for rent directly, as opposed to going through an agent. Rightmove said the platform accounted for less than 8% of listings on its site.\n\nThe move signals the changing landscape with Rightmove's shift in fee structure, which has reportedly increased for some third parties wanting to advertise on its site.\n\nRightmove said Openrent's split would not affect its guidance this financial year. It reiterated its forecast of a 7% to 9% increase in revenue and an underlying operating margin of 70%.\n\nStock was about 5.5% lower by mid-morning in London.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company Might End Up Being Nvidia's Biggest Competitor (Hint: It's Not AMD)",
        "content": "When it comes to semiconductor stocks, I'd wager that investors rarely look any further than Nvidia. And why would they?\n\nWith shares up 141% in just the past year, Nvidia has been a darling among megacap tech stocks and artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities more broadly.\n\nHowever, smart investors understand that nothing goes up forever. Eventually, reality sets in and investor euphoria can wane. Moreover, as AI continues to experience more demand, it's natural for other chip companies to emerge as formidable competitors to Nvidia.\n\nLet's break down where Nvidia stands today, and why Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) could end up as Nvidia's biggest challenger in the long run.\n\nNvidia is the 800-pound gorilla, but...\n\nNvidia specializes in designing semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPU).\n\nAt the moment, GPUs are in high demand as many technology companies are furiously at work training large language models (LLMs) or building machine learning applications.\n\nNvidia is estimated to have an 80% market share of the AI chip market thanks to the company's impressive line of A100, H100, and Blackwell chips.\n\nOn the surface, this dynamic looks great for business. However, the other side of the equation is that Nvidia is experiencing bottlenecks in its supply chain given such abnormal demand levels for its chips. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n...competition is not far behind, and...\n\nOutside of Nvidia, some of the more obvious competitors in the chip realm include AMD and Intel.\n\nAMD's MI300X accelerator and the Gaudi 3 from Intel are each company's response to Nvidia's GPU roster at the moment. While Nvidia is still in the lead, I don't think investors should sleep on the idea of competition catching up.\n\nThe current dynamics of Nvidia's supply constraints will allow companies like AMD and Intel to make a move and start gaining some ground on their larger competitor.\n\nBeyond mainstream chip designers, \"Magnificent Seven\" companies Amazon and Meta are also hard at work developing their own chips.\n\nWhile Meta currently uses hundreds of thousands of Nvidia H100 GPUs, the company is actively working to migrate away from its reliance on these chips by developing its own in-house tech.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon has also been touting its own line of chips -- dubbed Trainium and Inferentia. The company's recent $11 billion investment into data centers is a clear signal that Amazon is serious about its own chip development, and could very well become a major force competing against Nvidia in the future.\n\nNevertheless, despite the aggressive tactics coming from both direct and tangential competitors, I see Tesla as a sleeper pick for Nvidia's biggest competitor in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\n...Elon Musk is entering the ring\n\nOne of the character traits that makes Elon Musk so unique is that the entrepreneur has an unwavering knack for entering new markets. While Musk helped pioneer the electric vehicle (EV) movement, some moves by the company over the past couple of years suggest that his vision spans far beyond automobiles.\n\nMusk has made it clear that the next phase of Tesla hinges largely on successful execution of the company's self-driving software platform -- dubbed FSD. At its core, FSD is the key to building Tesla's robotaxi fleet, as well as igniting newfound demand for its EVs over the competition.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Tesla is currently a large customer of Nvidia and uses its GPUs to help train its self-driving car models, known as Dojo.\n\nHowever, during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk proclaimed that he plans to \"double down on Dojo\" and that the company has \"a path to being competitive with Nvidia with Dojo.\"\n\nOn the surface this might seem a little far-fetched. However, longtime Tesla investor Cathie Wood of Ark Invest considers robotaxi alone to be a $10 trillion opportunity in the long run.\n\nMoreover, Musk sees Tesla as far more than an EV manufacturer at this point. His view is that Tesla is a robotics and AI business.\n\nBearing all of that in mind, I think it actually makes sense that the company would begin to allocate more resources toward its own in-house tech and away from external vendors.\n\nAlthough I think it will take several years for Dojo to be on par with Nvidia or other leading providers, I believe in Musk's vision and his ability to create a full spectrum AI enterprise with a custom-built tech stack.\n\nGiven the potential of Tesla's Dojo supercomputing and processing power to disrupt the auto and robotics industries, I would not be surprised to see other companies begin to move away from Nvidia over time.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity for Tesla to enter yet another market, and gain ground on Nvidia by becoming a major force in the chip realm one way or another.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Donald Trump got a Tesla Cybertruck from a controversial influencer\u2014right after the former president said EVs will \u2018destroy the country\u2019",
        "content": "Adin Ross, a controversial streamer who has been banned from Twitch at least seven times, interviewed and gifted former President Donald Trump a custom Tesla Cybertruck on Monday.\n\nAfter interviewing Trump for a little over an hour, Ross led Trump outside of his Mar-a-Lago home to present the Cybertruck, which was adorned with the now-iconic photo of a bloodied Trump raising his fist after being shot, a flurry of American flags, and a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d logo wrapped at the front.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an Elon,\u201d Trump joked as he saw the car, referring to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nThe gift came almost immediately after Trump went on a four minute rant about an \u201celectric vehicle mandate\u201d that will \u201cdestroy the country.\u201d\n\nThe Republican nominee began by talking about the extraordinary amount of electricity that A.I. requires, and that if he became president, he would build more power plants to accommodate the new technology. Then, he turned his attention toward what he saw as wastes of electricity.\n\n\u201cYou know, they have this electric car mandate, and [electric cars] don't go far. They cost a lot. They're gonna be made in China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd under Biden, he wants everybody to drive electric: No more gas-propelled cars, no more hybrids, no more anything. Think of it. How crazy.\u201d\n\nHe then focused his attention on the short distance electric cars can go compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles that use gasoline or diesel.\n\n\u201cSame thing with trucks; they want trucks to go electric,\u201d Trump said. He said that to get from his home in Mar-a-Lago to Los Angeles, an electric truck has to make \u201csix stops,\u201d whereas a diesel truck can make no stops over the roughly 2,600 mile trek.\n\n\u201cOne gentleman, the biggest guy in that business, he said to me that \u2018all my life I've been buying trucks, 50 years I've been buying trucks, and every year they got better, bigger, stronger, more beautiful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe said a truck 50 years ago would have been better than what they're making us use right now. And I say, \u2018When you explain that, do they do anything?\u2019 They sit there they look and they say, \u2018We don't care. That's our mandate. You have to go all-electric.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d Ross replied. He then went on to close the interview. \u201cI know you're very busy\u2026 but I do want to give you this last gift,\u201d Ross said, referring to the Cybertruck.\n\nRoss and Trump sat in the truck and listened to the Beatles, Beach Boys, and Michael Jackson (\u201ca very good guy,\u201d Trump said). The former President did not extensively talk about or praise the truck beyond first calling it \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cincredible,\u201d but he sent a message to Musk, saying \u201cElon, you\u2019re great. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re seeing this but you\u2019re really good.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOver half a million people watched the stream live, according to Ross. He praised Trump and also gave him a Rolex watch. Ross has faced multiple bans from streaming platforms for the use of hate speech and showing inappropriate content during livestreams. He has also supported influencer Andrew Tate, who is facing serious legal issues including charges of rape and human trafficking.\n\nThe Cybertruck gift comes one day after Trump said he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to support electric cars since Musk began endorsing him.\n\nAfter a history of dismissing electric vehicles, Trump told supporters in Atlanta that they aren\u2019t all that bad. He added that they could continue to be a small slice of the U.S. car market should he retake the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for electric cars. I have to be, you know, because Elon Musk endorsed me very strongly,\u201d he said in comments shared widely throughout Musk\u2019s fan base by accounts like John Stringer\u2019s Tesla Owners Silicon Valley and blog site Teslarati. \u201cSo I have no choice.\u201d\n\nNow, Trump may have no choice but to become a Tesla owner himself. It is unclear if he accepted the gift or not.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley survey: Tesla's popularity is waning",
        "content": "Investing.com - Morgan Stanley's 6th Annual Intern Survey, released on Monday, revealed shifting preferences among future business leaders and influencers, suggesting significant trends that may impact the automotive industry.\n\nTesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) popularity has declined, with its desirability dropping to 11% from 14% year-over-year, now trailing behind Mercedes and BMW (ETR:BMWG). Preference for electric vehicles (EVs) also decreased, with only 15% of interns favoring them, while nearly twice as many preferred internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\n\nThe survey, which gathered insights from approximately 575 Morgan Stanley North American summer interns, indicates evolving tastes and preferences in the auto sector that could surprise industry insiders.\n\nThe allure of Tesla appears to be waning, as gasoline-powered cars are preferred over EVs by nearly a 2-to-1 margin among interns. Tesla's desirability has further dropped to 11%, compared to 14% last year, 19% in 2022, and 30% in 2021. This shift in preference has been largely absorbed by Mercedes (19% compared to 20% last year) and BMW (16% compared to 13% last year).\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the preference for EVs has declined (15% this year, 22% last year, and 30% in 2022). In contrast, the preference for combustion engines ticked up to 28% from 23% last year. This aligns with Morgan Stanley's cautious outlook on U.S. EV penetration in the near term; their 2030 EV penetration forecast was recently lowered to 20% from 25%, reinforcing their 'ICE is Nice' thesis.\n\nThe interns' perspectives on the near-term adoption of autonomous vehicles mirror Morgan Stanley's cautious stance. A majority (51%) believe that owning or leasing a car will still be necessary by 2030, up from 48% last year and 44% in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, 19% of interns said they would not use a robo-taxi, up from 12% last year. Despite the significant corporate and investor emphasis on autonomous driving, the path to full autonomy may be longer than expected, especially from a consumer trust perspective.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMorgan Stanley survey: Tesla's popularity is waning\n\nGoogle loses antitrust case over search dominance\n\nNvidia's AI chip demand to face limited impact from potential production delay, analysts say\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Elon Musk revives feud with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman\u2014\u2019the Emperor has no clothes\u2019",
        "content": "Elon Musk is once again going after the tech company he helped found. Musk filed a lawsuit Monday suing OpenAI and co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, alleging they \u201cmanipulated\u201d Musk to help create the company.\n\nThe lawsuit claims OpenAI breached the company\u2019s initial commitment to benefit humanity in favor of business interests. Altman and OpenAI\u2019s leaders \u201cintentionally courted and deceived Musk, preying on X owner\u2019s humanitarian concern about the existential dangers posed by artificial intelligence,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nMusk was an early investor in OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in December 2015. OpenAI restructured and formed OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity in 2019. OpenAI and Microsoftannounced a partnership that same year that involved a $1 billion investment. The alliance has since evolved and in 2023 expanded to include a multi-year, multi-billion investment reported to be $10 billion. Musk, in turn, felt betrayed by OpenAI and its partnership with Microsoft as they \u201cestablished an opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates, engaged in rampant self-dealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit today comes two months after he withdrew an earlier lawsuit against OpenAI, in which Musk similarly alleged the artificial intelligence research platform had abandoned its initial mission of altruism and widespread public sharing of its technology. Musk pulled the complaint without explanation the day before a judge was set to rule on its dismissal in June. In a March 2024 blog post in response to the lawsuit, OpenAI said, \u201cThe mission of OpenAI is to ensure [artificial general intelligence] benefits all of humanity, which means both building safe and beneficial A.G.I. and helping create broadly distributed benefits.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s lawyer Marc Toberoff said in a statement to Fortune, \u201cNo amount of spin and deflection by Defendants will evade accountability for their self-dealing and intentional misrepresentations to Musk and the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven to this day Defendants cloak themselves in altruism\u2014but as the world now knows the Emperor has no clothes,\u201d he added.\n\nMusk and Altman were locked in a power struggle over OpenAI since before 2018, the year Musk left the company. Fearing OpenAI had fallen behind Google\u2019s DeepMind AI research lab, Musk reportedly wanted to take sole control of the AI company. OpenAI\u2019s founders did not agree, leading Musk to vacate his board position. At the time, Musk publicly said he stepped down from OpenAI because his role there conflicted with his work at Tesla. In its blog post in response to Musk\u2019s March lawsuit, OpenAI included email excerpts from Musk detailing an argument for Tesla absorbing OpenAI and indicating he supported OpenAI\u2019s need for a for-profit arm to \u201ccreate a more sustainable revenue stream over time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow,\u201d Musk wrote in an email on Jan. 31, 2018. \u201cI believe attachments to other large suspects (e.g. Apple? Amazon?) would fail due to an incompatible company DNA.\u201d\n\n\u201cElon\u2019s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told Fortune.\n\nMusk\u2019s big stakes in AI\n\nMusk\u2019s own AI anxieties have been well documented for over a decade, with the Tesla boss advocating for the creation of a government committee to research and regulate the technology.\n\n\u201cAs AI gets probably much smarter than humans, the relative intelligence ratio is probably similar to that between a person and a cat, maybe bigger,\u201d he said in an interview with tech journalist Kara Swisher in 2018.\n\nAI has the potential to lead to \u201ccivilization destruction\u201d Musk said in April 2023, a month after he, along with several other tech leaders, signed a petition calling for a six-month pause in AI development following the release of GPT-4.\n\nBut for all Musk\u2019s criticisms on AI that span beyond his disdain for OpenAI itself, Musk has sunk much of his energy in his own AI ventures. He has spoken at length about the development of Dojo, a supercomputer that would train Tesla\u2019s network of self-driving cars. Musk founded xAI in March 2023 with the goal \u201cto understand the true nature of the universe\u201d\u2014and compete with OpenAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI venture raised $6 billion in May 2024 from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Saudi investor Kingdom Holding. Considered one of the better-funded AI projects to go head-to-head with OpenAI, xAI has a $24 billion valuation compared to OpenAI\u2019s $80 billion worth.\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s attacks on OpenAI are centered around his ethical concerns, xAI has received similar criticisms. After last November\u2019s introduction of Grok, the company\u2019s first AI model in the form of a sassy chatbot integrated in X, experts warned the product\u2019s supposed anti-political correctness risked proliferating biases and misinformation in the form of the model\u2019s hallucinations.\n\n\u201cElon Musk, on the other hand, decimated the trust and safety team at [X] and intends to make this Chatbot less politically correct\u2014aka more rude and inappropriate,\u201d Reid Blackman, AI ethics adviser at Virtue Consultants, told the Financial Times.\n\nTesla and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell roughly 8% in early trading as the Magnificent 7 stocks saw their worst intraday market cap loss ever during Monday's market plunge.\n\nAs of 10:00 a.m. ET the 'Mag 7' group was down more than $860 billion in market valuation. Together the Mag 7 stocks make up roughly 43% of the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) weighting.\n\nThe other components of the group also dropped with Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) and Meta (META) falling more than 3%. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) plunged more than 5%.\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) dropped more than 8% while software maker Microsoft (MSFT) plunged 5%.\n\nIndividual company news also put pressure on the Mag 7 stocks.\n\nApple (AAPL) dropped more than 4% after Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) revealed over the weekend it had cut half of its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nAI chip heavyweight Nvidia fell as much as 13% at the market open to pare some of its losses. Analysts noted recent negative catalysts weighing on the stock.\n\nThe Information reported the company's upcoming next-generation AI chips will be delayed by three months, potentially impacting its biggest customers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta.\n\n\"Nvidia has a window to sell to Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta while those companies are hot and bothered about building out data centers as quickly as they can. That window will shut at some point,\" Gil Luria, D.A Davison senior software analyst, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.\n\n\"If Nvidia is missing out on some of those sales during that window, that does have an impact on Nvidia's value,\" said the analyst.\n\nMonday's action follows a recent heavy sell-off on Wall Street as chip stocks have gotten hammered over the past week.\n\nOn Friday Nvidia closed off the lows of the session, down only 1.8% while Intel (INTC) shares cratered over 26% following a disastrous second quarter earnings report, and a broad decline in chip stocks led the tech sector lower.\n\nAfter the July jobs report, which showed job growth slowed last month and the unemployment rate reached a nearly three-year high, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped into correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high.

        "title": "Tech ETFs That Drew Billions Are Battered by Losses Hitting 60%",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders plowed billions of dollars into betting on a big rebound in tech stocks last month. Now their leveraged-up ETF positions are getting thrashed in the sweeping market meltdown.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do Valencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals A Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity Uber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts\n\nEven as the Nasdaq 100 Index tumbled in July, cash continued flowing into funds with notable exposures to companies like Nvidia Corp. and Intel Corp., indicating investors were wagering the slump would prove short lived.\n\nBut some of the ETFs \u2014 which use leverage to boost returns \u2014 are now being hit by double-digit drops as global investors pile into havens. That\u2019s increasing the risk that the ETFs will tumble even more deeply if investors start rushing to the exits.\n\nThe Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3x Shares (ticker SOXL), which delivers triple the daily move of the NYSE Semiconductor Index, took in a record $2.8 billion inflow in July, only to slide about 60% slide since July 10.\n\nThe ProShares UltraPro QQQ (ticker TQQQ), which outperforms when tech stocks rally, took in $830 million last month, the most since 2022, and has seen inflows of more than $400 million so far in August, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nMeanwhile, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (ticker NVDL), which bets on Nvidia outperforming, took in $560 million last month after a record $1.6 billion inflow in June. It has tumbled 50% in less than a month.\n\nThe data underscores how much investors have been blindsided by the swift shift in sentiment, with Friday\u2019s employment report helping to replace once-widespread faith in an economic soft landing with rekindled worries about a recession.\n\n\u201cThe biggest concern today will be \u2018forced selling,\u2019\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cIf the tech investors, especially the ones who own the leveraged ETFs, get margin calls today, they will have to sell at any price. It won\u2019t matter if the shares become cheap.\u201d\n\nThe data on Friday that showed unexpectedly slow payroll growth underscored the risk of an economic downturn just as earnings disappointments from some high-flying tech behemoths spurred fears that the stocks had run up too far. All the worries are now snowballing after the Federal Reserve opted not to cut rates at its July meeting, with some pundits calling for it to intervene before its next scheduled meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe worries have been compounded by quarterly reports from companies including Intel, whose shares suffered a historic decline last week after the firm gave a grim growth forecast and laid out plans to slash jobs. Amazon.com Inc., meantime, told investors that profits will for now take a back seat to heavy spending on AI, and its shares, too, dropped, losing 8% in the week ending Friday. The Nasdaq 100 tumbled as much as 5.5% on Monday.\n\n\u201cMany people are long growth/tech stocks, which is the brunt of the selloff,\u201d said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital. \u201cPeople who invest in leverage should understand the risks.\u201d\n\nMighty Tech, whose biggest names staged a sizzling rally through June, have plunged into a correction. That hasn\u2019t stopped investors from adding money to a fund that tracks Tesla Inc., Apple, Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) in July saw more than $170 million come in, its best month since its April 2023 inception.\n\nInvestors also poured cash into leveraged single-stock funds tracking companies like Tesla. For the $1.4 billion Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL), July marked its seventh straight month of inflows, with its 2024 haul adding up to nearly $700 million. It has tumbled more than 45% since July 10.\n\n\u201cLeverage is not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. \u201cEspecially during volatile environments, you have to be precise with your risk and positioning.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Emily Graffeo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here\u2019s Why Analysts are Bearish on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings.Since Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 9th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year, things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of \u201cdemand cracks.\u201d He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.\n\nBrent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more \u201cattractive.\u201d\n\nBut Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.\n\nAsked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.\n\nThill thinks the AI \u201cpayoff\u201d time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.\n\nFor this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Among the Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nCopyright: wolandmaster / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nAmid a decline in EV sales growth, Elon Musk\u2019s only option is to go all-in on AI. After a Twitter poll that overwhelmingly voted in favor of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) investing capital in xAI, Musks\u2019 AI company, the CEO of Tesla said he\u2019d discuss investing $5 billion in xAI with Tesla.\n\nElon Musk said in a latest earnings call with analysts that massive discounts from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitors created headwinds for the company in the most recently reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also delayed its robotaxi event until October. All possible catalysts for Tesla stock lie far into the future and the reality is revealing itself to Elon Musk who admitted during the\u00a0latest earnings call that he\u2019s been overly optimistic about robo taxis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that \u2014 to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.\u201d\n\nDuring the second quarter, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0automotive gross margin fell to 18.47% from 19.22% the previous year. Non-automotive revenue, now 22% of total sales compared to 14.67% in Q2 2023, has a lower gross margin, negatively impacting overall profitability. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0\u00a0is still heavily reliant on EVs where demand is falling. Tesla energy business is not strong enough to offset declines in the core business.\n\nCathie Wood recently set a $2600 price target on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) for 2029, which presents a whopping 1300% upside potential from the current levels. Wood thinks the robo taxi project has the potential to deliver $8 to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nHowever, many believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) won\u2019t be able to live up to the hype around its robo taxi plans. Each robo taxi is expected to have a price target of around $150K to $200K, with some estimates suggesting Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) would need about $35 billion to develop a global feet of such cars. Amid inflation and lack of preference for electric cars, American families will probably stay away from spending a fortune on robo taxis, which could cause a blow to Tesla Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans in the future.\n\nBaron Partners Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the Fund\u2019s underperformance this quarter stemmed from the Fund\u2019s 10-year investment in\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla\u2019s shares fell 29.3% during the period and detracted 13.41% from the Fund\u2019s first quarter results. Although Tesla has contributed importantly to the Fund\u2019s performance since 2014, on occasion it has detracted from quarterly performance. In previous instances when Tesla shares have underperformed during a discrete period, they have shortly afterwards reflected the strong growth of the underlying business and the stock has appreciated considerably. We believe that will be the case again, although cannot guarantee it.\n\nA significant decline also occurred at the end of 2022. In that instance, investors had become concerned about a host of external factors. Investors believed the company founder, visionary, and CEO Elon Musk was distracted by his acquisition of Twitter. They also believed a weak Chinese economy emerging from COVID and U.S. government policies would curtail the purchases of Tesla vehicles. These fears proved to be overblown. As the company achieved milestones in the succeeding year, the stock subsequently doubled over the next 12 months\u2026\u201d\n\nOverall, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 9th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\n\u201cThe Fed needs to drop rates.

        "title": "Donald Trump admits EV flip-flop was a quid-pro-quo to secure Elon Musk\u2019s support",
        "content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump admitted to tempering his strident opposition to electric vehicles in order to gain the endorsement of billionaire Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla.\n\nThe former president, well known for the transactional nature of his politics, has championed an economic agenda relying heavily on cheap, plentiful energy through fracking and mining of U.S. fossil fuel deposits that drive climate change. Tesla\u2019s stated mission however is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\n\nSpeaking to supporters in Atlanta, Trump now said EVs aren\u2019t all that bad, adding they could continue being a small slice of the U.S. car market should he retake the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for electric cars. I have to be, you know, because Elon Musk endorsed me very strongly,\u201d he said in comments shared widely throughout Musk's fanbase by accounts like John Stringer\u2019s Tesla Owners Silicon Valley and blogsiteTeslarati. \u201cSo I have no choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am for electric cars. I have to because Elon Musk endorsed me very strongly, Elon. So, I have no choice.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump \r\npic.twitter.com/A0SfvDp5Al\n\n\u2014 Tesla Owners Silicon Valley (@teslaownersSV) August 5, 2024\n\nLast month the New York real estate mogul pledged to roll back President Biden\u2019s EV subsidies, which he labelled a \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d on day one of a second Trump administration.\n\nSpeaking to Maria Bartiromo on Thursday, Trump explained all the electric cars in the future will be made in China, since the United States doesn't have the mineral resources of its rival, the world market leader in processing battery-grade lithium.\n\n\"They don't go far [and] they cost too much,\" he said, referring to EVs. \"I like Tesla, but you know what? It's limited.\"\n\nHis vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, meanwhile has pushed a bill called the \u201cDrive American Act\u201d that would repeal Biden\u2019s $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs and hand them instead to conventional combustion engine cars.\n\nThis has put Musk on the backfoot, forcing the EV champion to claim late last month Trump\u2019s hostility to EVs would harm his competition more than it would Tesla itself.\n\nMusk\u2019s brand sells roughly as many EVs in the U.S. as\u00a0all its other competitors combined. Along with China's BYD, it is one of the only two carmakers in the world to build EVs profitably at scale.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumers fleeing brand in Europe\n\nNevertheless, Elon Musk\u2019s brand of right-wing politics, increasingly ardent since he acquired Twitter at the end of October 2022, has fractured the Tesla community into those that support its mission to phase out fossil fuels and tech enthusiasts that back Musk first and foremost.\n\nAnecdotal and empirical evidence suggests this has contributed to a small but growing number of customers abandoning the brand for competitors like Rivian, especially in\u00a0Tesla\u2019s own stronghold of California.\n\nEurope, whose EV market is 60% larger than the U.S., has seen a plunge in Tesla demand as the tycoon embraced the continent\u2019s far right, an ally of Trump, who is highly controversial on the continent. As president, Trump cozied up to Russia's Vladimir Putin while branding European Union as America's real \"foe\" in the region.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBgSDNTtM48\n\nMusk\u2019s engagement with political fringe parties like the AfD, under official observation by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service as a danger to democracy, has soured support for the brand in an EV-friendly market where consumers are already spoiled for choice.\n\nOn Monday, registration data published for\u00a0Germany, the UK and France\u2014the three largest EV markets in Europe\u2014showed Tesla sales in the first seven months drop 41%, 13% and 28%, respectively, over the previous year\u2019s period.\n\nBy comparison the most recent continent-wide data showed EV sales edged 1.6% higher in the first half of this year, implying all other brands dramatically outperformed Tesla.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors globally are reeling from a historic sell-off, with the Nikkei plunging over 12% overnight, triggering market carnage that has US markets deep in the red.\n\nAmid this turmoil, Wedbush analysts urged calm and strategic action, particularly in the tech sector.\n\nAccording to Wedbush, \"This is not the time to panic on the tech trade; it's the time to go bargain hunting for our top tech names after this panic sell-off.\"\n\nThe firm says that several factors have converged to create this \"perfect storm\" risk-off environment, including the Nikkei/Yen carry trade unwind, last week's tech weakness, Warren Buffett's decision to sell 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRKa) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake, and geopolitical jitters.\n\nHowever, Wedbush believes these events create a unique buying opportunity. \"We do not hide in times of panic and market chaos,\" the note states, highlighting that historically, such sell-offs have provided the best long-term opportunities to invest in tech leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nDespite the current market turbulence, Wedbush maintains a bullish outlook on the tech sector, driven by the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nThey assert, \"This is just a white knuckle moment in a multi-year bull run for tech stocks that need hand holding.\"\n\nThe firm underscores its confidence in a \"soft landing environment\" with the Fed entering what it sees as a major rate-cutting cycle over the next 18 months. Moreover, the AI sector is seen as entering a new growth phase, reminiscent of the early days of the internet.\n\nThis earnings season has reinforced Wedbush's positive outlook, with strong performances and optimistic forecasts from major tech players.\n\nThey note that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have shown robust cloud growth, and the AI monetization phase is gaining momentum.\n\n\"We focus on tech spending and the winners that will be front and center in this massive AI tech buildout,\" Wedbush emphasizes.\n\n\"We would strongly focus more on what is happening at the likes at Apple (bullish conf. call and outlook from Cook), Nvidia, Microsoft (Azure 2H accel), Alphabet, Amazon (AWS monster number), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as barometers and see the forest through the trees despite this morning's carnage,\" they concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nNow not the time to panic on the tech trade, bargain hunt after selloff: Wedbush\n\nElon Musk revives lawsuit against Sam Altman and OpenAI, filing shows\n\nTyson Foods beats Q3 estimates, shares rise on strong results\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Meta\u2019s META.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings: Good or Bad?\n\nOf the six members of \u2018The Magnificent 7\u2019 group that have already reported June-quarter results, the market was disappointed with Tesla, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon . Conversely, it was okay with Apple\u2019s quarterly release and loved Meta\u2019s results.\n\nThis is clearly not a good picture and likely suggestive of tougher times ahead for the group. Some in the market are likely thinking the Mag 7 leadership of the market is likely behind us.\n\nI will push back on parts of this narrative, as most of the Mag 7 stocks provide some of the most sustainable growth performance in the entire market.\n\nAside from Apple, which is likely no longer a growth company, and Tesla, which is dealing with a combination of competitive pressures and a cyclical downturn in its core market, the other five are not only generating impressive top- and bottom-line growth today, but the trend is expected to remain in place at least through next year, if not beyond.\n\nTake the case of Amazon, which modestly missed the Zacks Consensus revenue estimate. Amazon\u2019s Q2 earnings almost doubled from the year-earlier level (up +99.8%) to $13.16 billion on +10.1% higher revenues to roughly $148 billion.\n\nAlphabet beat on the top and bottom lines, with its Q2 earnings up +28.6% to $23.6 billion on +15% higher revenues to $71.4 billion. Microsoft also beat on the top- and bottom lines, coming out with Q2 earnings that increased +9.7% to $22 billion on +15.2% higher revenues to $56.2 billion.\n\nSo why is everyone so glum if these companies are bringing in so much in revenues and earnings?\n\nThe answer to that question lies in what these companies are doing to prepare for the artificial intelligence (AI) world. Each one is heavily investing in building out the AI infrastructure; the amounts involved are huge and bigger than what many in the markets had been expecting. And that is the primary reason why investors are so glum; they feel that these companies haven\u2019t provided a good-enough explanation of how these huge investments will be monetized.\n\nWe noted in this space last week the comment from Alphabet's CEO, who said that underinvestment in the AI opportunity represented a bigger risk at this stage than the alternative.\n\nWe have no reason to think that these otherwise very well-run companies are throwing good money on questionable projects. As such, we like these companies investing in their future, which will ensure their importance and leadership status in the AI-centric future world. In other words, we think the market\u2019s capex fixation is overdone.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.3% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week\u2019s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 2nd, we have seen Q2 results from 377 S&P 500 members, or 75.4% of the index\u2019s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +11.2% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating EPS estimates and only 59.2% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have seen results from three-quarters of the S&P 500 already. This week, more than 1,300 companies, including 80 S&P 500 members, will report results. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include Disney, Expedia, Eli Lilly, Airbnb, Uber, Caterpillar, Ralph Lauren, Shopify, and others.\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59.2% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +10.5% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last nine quarters since the +35.7% growth rate in 2021 Q4.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.5% on +1.9% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +4.2% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.1% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Breaking Down the Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "You can't buy a Chinese EV in the United States. But they dominate in Southeast Asia",
        "content": "A record number of brands participated in Indonesia's largest auto show in Tangerang outside Jakarta. One-third of passenger car brands at the event were Chinese companies, drawn to the Indonesian market by the government's favorable policies to spur consumer adoption and local manufacturing. (Stephanie Yang / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLate last year Chinese automaker BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nBut you won't find its cars in the United States anytime soon. With the Chinese auto industry facing tariffs in the U.S. and the European Union, one of its most important markets is Southeast Asia.\n\nOf the 31 passenger car brands represented last month at the sprawling Indonesia International Auto Show outside Jakarta, about a third were from China. The vast majority of those were electric vehicles.\n\nStriding past fashion models and huge video displays, Safik Bahsein made his way to the BYD display, where he honed in on a BYD Dolphin, which promises 300 miles on a single charge and sells for the equivalent of $26,000. Visitors look at a BYD car during an auto show last month. Chinese car companies have been gaining ground in Indonesia, particularly in EVs. (Tatan Syuflana / Associated Press)\n\nIt's one of three EV models that BYD now sells in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country \u2014 with more than 275 million people \u2014 and the largest car market in Southeast Asia. The company's first shipment of 1,000 EVs arrived last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite beautiful,\u201d said Bahsein, 49, who works in shipping. \u201cCompared with European cars, I think BYD has good prospects in the future.\u201d\n\nIn his view, the quality of Chinese cars now matches those from Europe and Japan. He said he was considering buying one for his wife, though he still prefers his Tesla Model 3, which he had to have specially imported two years ago because there are no dealers in Indonesia.\n\nRead more:China\u2019s highflying EV industry is going global. Why that has Tesla and other carmakers worried\n\nThe country's car market has long been dominated by the Japanese brands Toyota, Daihatsu and Honda. But Chinese companies have been gaining ground, particularly in EVs, where Japanese automakers have lagged.\n\nChinese brands accounted for 43% of EV sales in the first half of 2024, according to the Assn. of Indonesia Automotive Industries.\n\nBut getting people to buy EVs has been especially challenging in Indonesia, where there are many cheaper alternatives and a dearth of charging stations. Only 17,121 EVs were sold last year \u2014 just 2% of all auto sales. \"Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand and Indonesia, is the beachhead, both as a market and a production base,\" said Lei Xing, former chief editor of the China Automotive Review. (Tatan Syuflana / Associated Press)\n\nThe Indonesian government has created incentives for EV buyers and set a goal of 400,000 EV sales next year. But the international data analytics firm Fitch Solutions has suggested that a more realistic expectation is 56,000 by 2028.\n\nFor Goldie Liem, 24, who recently bought a Binguo EV from the Chinese carmaker Wuling, the biggest incentive was the license plate, which exempts Jakarta drivers from road restrictions meant to cut down on traffic.\n\nThat saves her time on her daily office commute, which can take up to two hours. She said she also saves on gas, and pays about $60 a year in taxes compared with $430 for her old Mazda.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more:Feds pump $2 billion into boosting U.S.-based EV manufacturing\n\n\u201cIt gets me from A to B, that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried to take it out of town yet, because I\u2019m not that brave, in terms of charging stations and all that.\u201d\n\nIt would take much more to make her husband an EV convert. They couple had come to the auto show so he could check out gas-powered BMWs.\n\nIn China, the EV industry has flourished thanks to clean energy subsidies and access to comprehensive supply chains for battery technology and vehicle manufacturing. But intense domestic competition has prompted price cuts and led automakers to look overseas for growth.\n\nBrazil, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Thailand and the Philippines are the biggest export markets this year, according to the China Passenger Car Assn. Indonesia is among the fastest growing. Wuling, a Chinese EV brand, accounts for about 40% of EV sales in Indonesia. But electric cars still only make up about 2% of total car sales, hampered by insufficient charging infrastructure. (Stephanie Yang / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\"Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand and Indonesia, is the beachhead, both as a market and a production base,\" said Lei Xing, an independent auto analyst and former chief editor of the China Automotive Review. \"It's not like you\u2019re going into Europe and competing against the Volkswagens and the BMWs. Now with the EV opportunity, Chinese brands are jumping on that.\"\n\nBYD recently announced plans to build a $1.3-billion EV plant two hours from Jakarta that will begin operations in 2026, joining other Chinese brands Neta and Wuling to build electric cars in Indonesia.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Indonesia also happens to be one of the world\u2019s leading producers of nickel and other minerals needed in EV batteries.\n\nChina has already invested billions of dollars in Indonesian nickel mines in order to procure the strategic metal. Now Indonesia is trying to attract more Chinese funding to process its natural resources and build cars at home.\n\nIn an op-ed this year for China Daily, a state-run newspaper, a senior Indonesian transportation official declared his country\u2019s EV industry \u201copen for business.\u201d\n\nThe official, Rachmat Kaimuddin, the deputy coordinating minister of transportation and infrastructure, also encouraged Chinese carmakers to take advantage of the \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d of recently announced tax incentives for international car brands producing in Indonesia.\n\nFor brands like BYD, building more facilities in other countries is a critical part of global expansion, particularly as the U.S. and EU have threatened to implement harsher policies to keep cheap Chinese models from pushing out their own domestic manufacturers. Leading Chinese automaker BYD delivered its first 1,000 EVs to Indonesian consumers this year, as it expands its manufacturing and sales in one of Southeast Asia's biggest auto markets. (Stephanie Yang / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLast month, the EU announced tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese EVs. In the U.S., President Biden raised the existing 25% tariff on Chinese EVs to 100%.\n\nBYD has also opened a plant in Thailand, and has announced investment plans for Turkey, Hungary and Mexico, which could help the automaker sidestep foreign import taxes in the U.S. and Europe on Chinese goods.\n\nRead more:Editorial: China embraced electric vehicles. The U.S. didn't. Now we're paying the price\n\n\u201cThese are very strategic locations,\u201d said Xing, the auto analyst. \u201cIn order to be global, I think the U.S. and Europe are the last two frontiers.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, there is Southeast Asia. At the auto show, Ricky Aristin, 23, spent two hours browsing cars that could potentially replace his Honda Accord. The highlight was climbing into the driver's seat of a BYD Seal, an electric sedan that sells for about $44,000.\n\n\u201cIt feels like an expensive car,\u201d Aristin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good experience from the car with the lowest price.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he decided he wouldn't buy an EV until Jakarta has more charging stations.\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway's Massive $277M Cash Hoard Rekindles Tesla Investment Chatter: Fund Manager Says 'Two Worlds Seldom Collide'\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.\u2018s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) second-quarter 10-Q report filed with the SEC showed that the investment holding company\u2019s cash position swelled to $277 million. The cash buildup sent social media into a tizzy, with some Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) fans fervently hoping that the investment guru would divert some of it into the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s stock.\n\nWhat Happened: \u201cBuffett is a value investor. $TSLA is a growth stock,\u201d said The Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black in a post on X. Black, who is a Tesla bull, was referring to Buffett\u2019s investment rationale of picking up quality stocks trading at bargains, which is the premise behind value investing.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.

Their high valuations are justified only by the returns they can generate in the future.\n\nDespite Tesla stock\u2019s secular decline seen since late 2022, it still trades at an elevated forward P/E multiple of 84.75, according to the Yahoo Finance database.\n\nSource: Benzinga Pro data\n\nSee Also: America's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\nNever The Twain Shall Meet: \u201cThe two worlds seldom collide,\u201d said Black in the post, referring to Buffett\u2019s ideology and Tesla\u2019s stock characteristic. Clarifying further, the fund manager said Buffett first bought Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock when it traded at less than 12 times earnings and BYD Co. Ltd (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDY) stock when it was trading at less than 10 times earnings.\n\nTesla \u201cisn\u2019t his type [of] stock,\u201d said Black.\n\nIncidentally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has in the past resented that Buffett and his trusted late lieutenant Charlie Munger had overlooked Tesla as an investment option. Musk has mentioned an unsuccessful meeting with\u00a0Munger in 2009 regarding a potential Tesla investment.\n\nEvery time Berkshire\u2019s massive cash position is being discussed on social media, the world\u2019s richest man has indirectly nudged Buffett to take a stake in Tesla. Buffett, while giving Tesla a snub, has admired Musk. \u201cElon is a brilliant, brilliant guy and I would say that he might score over a 100%,\u201d Buffett said at one Berkshire shareholder meeting. \u201cHe dreams about things and his dream have got a foundation.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla ended Friday\u2019s session down 4.24% at $207.67, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.

        "title": "EV costs on track to match gas guzzlers as early as next year as battery prices drop 'dramatically'",
        "content": "The higher cost of owning an electric versus a gas-powered vehicle is a sticking point for many would-be buyers of EVs. Now, the price of a key EV component is falling, raising hopes that automakers could close the gap as they grapple with waning demand.\n\nBatteries make up about one-third to one-fourth of the cost of producing an electric vehicle, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The firm predicts the global average cost to automakers for batteries in 2024 will average about $115 per kilowatt hours, about 23% lower than last year. Prices are expected fall another 20% in 2025.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk (TSLA) recently noted costs have come down for lithium-ion cells used in EV batteries, a big reversal from the \"massive spike\" during the pandemic when car manufacturers put in \"giant, giant orders.\"\n\nMusk said at the company's shareholder meeting in June that \"battery cell suppliers have increased their supply, and the orders from other car manufacturers have declined.\"\n\nThe drop in demand has impacted the price of lithium. The essential mineral used to make current EV batteries has plunged more than 70% over the past year.\n\n\"Raw material prices are a significant factor in the overall cost of EV batteries. As battery prices decrease due to technological advancements, the contribution of raw material costs becomes more significant,\" Kieran O'Regan, co-founder of battery data and software company About:Energy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nTo be sure, batteries are just one factor in how much EVs cost, which includes everything from research and development to assembly and manufacturing. But it's one of the most important components as the industry races to catch up with China, where the cost to own an electric vehicle is already cheaper than a gas-powered car. An EV charging station is seen Thursday, May 9, 2024, in San Antonio. Many Americans still aren\u2019t sold on going electric for their next car purchase. High prices and a lack of easy-to-find charging stations are major sticking points. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAlan Taub, director of Michigan Materials Research Institute at the University of Michigan, says the battery industry has already come a long way toward bringing down the price of EVs.\n\n\"The cost is dropping dramatically through technology,\" said Taub. \"Right now, there's nothing that looks like the Achilles heel of 'you can't get there.'\"\n\nThis year automakers in the US have scaled back their electric vehicle rollout plans amid waning demand. Price is one reason for the tepid enthusiasm, along with range anxiety and consumer preference for hybrids.\n\nCar companies have tried to make EVs cheaper for consumers through financing deals and cash incentives, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, prices in the US haven't come down enough to make it cheaper to buy an EV than a gas-powered vehicle.\n\nThe average cost of an electric vehicle sat at $56,371 in June, compared to gas-powered vehicles at $48,644, according to Kelly Blue Book.  Visitors look over a 2024 Cybertruck in the Tesla display at the Electrify Expo, Sunday, July 14, 2024, in north Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nPart of the reason for the price disparity is US drivers' tendency toward bigger cars that require larger, more expensive batteries. There's also a delay between battery costs come down and when they're incorporated new vehicles.\n\n\"There is a time lag that we need to account for here and that's why 2024 is still a tough year from an EV demand perspective, but we do see catalysts opening up in 2025 from a demand perspective,\" Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Asia-Pacific natural resources and clean energy at Goldman Sachs, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts estimate a breakeven point between EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, without accounting for government subsidies, will be achieved in the US between 2025 and 2026 as battery prices fall further next year. The cost of ownership not only includes the price of the actual vehicle but also fuel or battery charging, repairs, and maintenance over the lifetime of a car.\n\nGoldman's timeline appears to coincide with comments made by Elon Musk during the company's latest earnings call when he said \"we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.\"\n\nInterest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve along with government electrification incentives will also likely play a role in spurring demand.\n\nOnce prices go well below breakeven, \u201cthen [the electric vehicle] actually becomes a cash machine,\u201d said Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets global autos analyst, highlighting the cost benefit of not having to include catalytic converters, engines, or transmissions, which are found in ICE vehicles.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "5 Top Stocks to Buy in August",
        "content": "There's been a lot going on between enduring the sweltering summer heat, kicking back and watching the Olympics, and getting ready for back-to-school season. But the stock market just had arguably its most dramatic month of the year, with many mega-cap tech stocks plummeting, plenty of rebounds across small caps, and surprisingly red-hot runs in value-focused sectors like utilities.\n\nNo matter the cause or complexion of market gyrations, it's important to filter out the noise and focus on the companies that have what it takes to grow their earnings -- and in some cases their dividends -- over time.\n\nHere's why these five Motley Fool contributors are especially excited about The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), Nio (NYSE: NIO), Visa (NYSE: V), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) as top stocks to buy in August. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCapitalizing on a recent pullback\n\nAnders Bylund (The Trade Desk): Digital marketing expert The Trade Desk has seen some volatility lately. The stock has gained more than 25% year to date, but it also trades more than 12% below its recent multiyear highs.\n\nOne might think it's an expensive investment, since the stock trades at a lofty 223 times trailing earnings and 80 times free cash flow. But you're also looking at a sector leader with stellar sales growth, working in an online advertising industry with plenty of growth catalysts up its collective sleeve.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympic Games are on the air, with world-class sports content available across several streaming platforms. It's also an election year, with lots of political ad content across every conceivable media type. These events tend to go hand in hand every leap year, often with market-moving consequences.\n\nAnd the digital marketing sector is coming back from a couple of rough years when ad buyers held onto their wallets due to raging inflation. Why spend a ton of money on targeted marketing when no one is ready to buy your goods and services? The upswing from that dark trough could be impressive, releasing years of pent-up advertising demand in a few short months.\n\nSo The Trade Desk is poised to perform in August and beyond. Its earnings are expected to jump 29% higher year over year in Friday's second-quarter report. Sales should also soar by at least 25%, according to the analyst consensus, though the company has a habit of leaving analyst estimates far behind.\n\nThis stock can be volatile, and I can't guarantee that it won't ever be cheaper than it is today. But if you don't have The Trade Desk in your stock portfolio yet, you're missing out on a tremendous growth stock with robust business prospects, both in the near term and over the long haul. You should consider grabbing a few shares in this compelling price dip.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis price drop is an opportunity\n\nNeha Chamaria(Nio): The once red-hot electric vehicle (EV) stocks have hit a speed bump in recent months amid fears of a global slowdown. That includes Nio's stock, which has crashed a whopping 50% so far this year. I believe the sell-off is now overdone, and the second half of the year could be a lot better for the Chinese EV maker and give its stock price a much-needed boost.\n\nNio's deliveries and margins fell consistently for some quarters but now show signs of a recovery. In the first quarter, for example, Nio delivered a little over 30,000 EVs, which was down 3% year over year and nearly 40% from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nNio's deliveries, however, have improved significantly since, with the company even surpassing management's estimates and delivering more than 57,000 units in the second quarter.\n\nTo be sure, one quarter alone does not signal an uptrend, but there's a valid reason to believe that Nio's deliveries should continue to rise. The thing is, Nio started upgrading all of its models late last year, which hurt production and sales.\n\nThe upgrades were completed in April, which is also when Nio's deliveries picked up. I expect the trend to continue, and as its deliveries rise, so should its vehicle and gross margins. Dwindling margins were among the biggest factors that weighed on the stock's price.\n\nMeanwhile, Nio also launched a mass-market brand called Onvo in May and expects to start deliveries of its first midsize SUV, the L60, in late September. Expectations are high since the L60 will compete with EV leader Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) hot-selling Model Y and offer better pricing.\n\nOverall, with Nio's deliveries on the rise and margins likely to rebound, the EV stock looks like a compelling buy at current prices.\n\nChecking all the boxes\n\nDaniel Foelber (Visa): When looking for stocks, it's easy to get too caught up in the price action and use it as a yardstick for where a stock has been and where it could be headed. A better way to determine which stocks to buy is to take a step back and think about the qualities that make up an excellent business, and then find companies that match that profile.\n\nVisa has been a company I've admired for some time. Its global position has never been stronger. And yet the stock has sold off 12% in the past four months. I think it's a compelling stock to buy in August.\n\nVisa has a diverse revenue stream spanning domestic and international markets, credit cards and debit cards, and consumers and corporate clients. The business model is essentially perfect: Charge a flat fee per transaction and a variable fee based on the size of the transaction. Visa wins whether you tap your card and spend $1 or $1,000, but it makes more if it's the latter.\n\nVisa often gets roped into cyclical stock conversations. And while it's true that it benefits from increased spending and economic growth, it strikes me as more of a staple at this point.\n\nThe transition to cashless digital and mobile payments has accelerated growth for credit card companies. It wasn't long ago that you would have to convert U.S. dollars to local currency in cash when traveling abroad. But now, the conversions are automatic using a Visa card, which is one of the reasons Visa's international segment is growing faster than its domestic one.\n\nVisa fell after reporting its third-quarter results. U.S. payments volume declined, and international growth was weighed down by a poor performance in China. Still, Visa's results are respectable.\n\nBetter yet, Visa's key valuation metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales, and price-to-free cash flow are all below historical levels. It now has a lower P/E than the S&P 500 even though it is arguably a much better business than the average component in the index.\n\nTo top it off, Visa generates a boatload of free cash flow that it uses to buy back stock and pay a growing dividend. Don't let Visa's 0.8% yield fool you -- if it wanted to, it could pay nearly four times that if it reallocated the money it was using for buybacks on dividends instead.\n\nHowever, buybacks have historically been a much better use of capital because Visa has been a market-outperforming stock, and the buybacks have helped reduce the share count -- thereby boosting earnings per share and making Visa a better value.\n\nAdd it all up, and Visa is a near-perfect business that you don't have to pay a premium price for.\n\nA great ultra-high-yield dividend stock\n\nKeith Speights (Enbridge): I realize that ultra-high-yield dividend stocks might not be everyone's cup of tea. But Enbridge could be worth a sip for any investor in August, even if you're not looking for income.\n\nEnbridge ranks as a leader in the North American energy sector. The company operates pipelines and terminals that transport and store crude oil, natural gas, and other liquid hydrocarbons. It also has a natural gas utility business and owns solar and wind assets in renewable energy.\n\nWith a dividend yield of over 7.2%, Enbridge doesn't have to deliver much share price appreciation for investors to enjoy attractive total returns. Although the stock hasn't performed especially well so far in 2024, I think Enbridge's growth prospects are pretty good.\n\nThe company can count on 1% to 2% annual growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from its inflation-based revenue escalators and cost-cutting programs alone. Enbridge is investing in several pipeline expansions that could drive further growth. It also recently completed the acquisition of Questar Gas from Dominion Energy.\n\nI like its risk profile. Over 98% of its cash flow is contracted or part of cost-of-service arrangements. More than 95% of the company's customers are investment-grade. Around 80% of Enbridge's EBITDA is protected from inflation.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, Enbridge is reasonably valued. The stock trades below 17.6 times forward earnings.\n\nShop for discounts\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Walmart): Retailing giant Walmart will announce its second-quarter results in mid-August, but investors don't have to wait until then to buy this sturdy dividend stock.\n\nThe company gave investors plenty to cheer in its last visit to the earnings plate back in May, with sales and profitability both rising in the first quarter. Walmart enjoyed strong customer traffic in its online business and at stores, helping it stand out against rivals like Target. I would expect those trends to continue when the company reports fresh results on Aug. 15.\n\nBesides customer traffic, watch Walmart's profit margin in August. Operating income growth should slightly exceed the 4% uptick in expected second-quarter revenue, just as it has for most of the past year.\n\nThe retailer is getting help in this department from strong demand for its low-priced products, but also from margin-boosting revenue streams like online advertising. Falling inventory last quarter, meanwhile, also sets the stage for another strong period for earnings.\n\nLooking further out, shareholders can expect Walmart to return more of its ample cash flow in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Sure, the stock yields below 1.5% today, and you can get higher initial income by owning Target or Home Depot. Yet Walmart has returned about $3 billion to investors in each of the past two quarters, split roughly evenly between buybacks and dividend spending. And the chain's recent 9% hike shows management's commitment to prioritizing a rising payout.\n\nUnlike most of the products it sells, Walmart's stock isn't especially cheap at nearly 30 times trailing earnings. Investors should still consider building up a position in the market leader to benefit from its strengthening profitability over the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Elon Musk Just Told Tesla Investors to Sell Their Shares. Here's Why He Might Be Right.",
        "content": "Earnings season is back in full bloom, and per usual, big tech is providing investors with no shortage of reasons to pay attention.\n\nElectric vehicle (EV) pioneer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) got the party started by kicking off earnings season in late July. In a shock to probably no one, Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared his brutally honest thoughts about the company's future.\n\nLet's take a look at some of Musk's polarizing remarks during the earnings call, and assess why he might be right and what it means for Tesla investors in the long run.\n\nElon said what?!\n\nAlthough Tesla is best known for its fleet of EVs, Musk has made it abundantly clear on several occasions that he sees the company as an artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics business.\n\nWhile there are many ways that Tesla can benefit from AI, the company's primary focus is developing superior autonomous-driving technology. These ambitions riled up investors and \"smart money\" analysts on Wall Street for quite some time.\n\nHowever, after years of intense research and development and aggressive spending, Musk is now being increasingly peppered about the progress of Tesla's self-driving capabilities.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk didn't mince his words when he boldly said, \"I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla would solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock.\"\n\nTo me, this was Musk's version of drawing a line in the sand. If investors think the idea of autonomous driving carries too much execution risk or is merely something more akin to science fiction, they should move on, Musk told investors.\n\nWhile anyone can appreciate the honesty here, the brashness of this kind of communication can be jarring. Think of it this way: Have you ever heard a CEO tell you not to invest?\n\nDespite the curtness of Musk's words, I think investors were hit with a sobering dose of reality -- and it's high time to consider why Musk might actually be right. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy he might be right?\n\nTesla's autonomous-driving software is referred to as full self-driving (FSD) by management. Right now, there are two key ways that FSD can help ignite further growth at Tesla.\n\nFirst, if Tesla's FSD proves to be better than other autonomous-driving platforms available on the market, it could lead to an influx of new EV buyers.\n\nThe second opportunity for FSD lies in Tesla's vision to build a large-scale fleet of self-driving cars -- an initiative referred to as Robotaxi. If executed flawlessly, a fleet of self-driving vehicles could make shockwaves in markets such as ride-hailing, delivery and logistics, as well as rental car businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there are also some inherent risks. For one thing, Tesla could be hurt if FSD does not scale exponentially. It's pretty difficult to quantify how many people actually want to buy a car that drives itself or would feel comfortable riding in one.\n\nSecondly, the Robotaxi rollout hasn't been flawless so far. Earlier this year, Musk and his team told investors that a preview of Robotaxi would be revealed on Aug. 8. Unfortunately, this highly anticipated event is now delayed and only adds to speculation and skepticism of how good FSD really is and if it's ready for widespread commercialization and adoption.\n\nA third risk that I see as it pertains to FSD is related to costs. Developing self-driving technology requires robust spending on engineering, quality-assurance testing, and more.\n\nFor now, Tesla is relying heavily on training its FSD models on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) -- an endeavor that is racking up billions in spend for Tesla at the moment.\n\nFor all of these reasons, if you can't fully buy into the notion of autonomous driving, its potential to scale, and Tesla's ability to execute, then Musk's advice to pass over Tesla stock might be absolutely correct.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAs investors, it's important to zoom out and think about the big picture. Throughout history, many successful businesses branched out from their initial products and evolved into more sophisticated operations.\n\nI think Tesla is very much at a point in its evolution that it no longer should be viewed as an automobile company. The company's transition from an EV and energy-storage business to a full-blown AI enterprise serves as the next frontier for Tesla.\n\nTo me, Musk's comments should not be seen as intimidating or a warning. Rather, he's making it clear that Tesla has an ambitious vision revolving around AI. If you're not aligned with that, holding the stock will likely just be frustrating for you.\n\nAs a longtime shareholder of Tesla myself, I've been sold on the vision around AI and robotics for some time. I appreciate Musk's candor on the earnings call, and see Tesla as a compelling AI opportunity that is both misunderstood and underappreciated.\n\nHowever, before initiating a position or adding to one, I think it's worth taking some time to listen carefully to Musk's advice and his outline for the future of Tesla.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Top Automotive Industry Trend",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the Top 18 Automotive Industry Innovations and Trends and in this article, we will look at the top trend in the automotive industry.\n\nAn Analysis of the Future of Mobility\n\nAccording to a report by PwC, the future of the global automotive industry is explained by the acronym \"EASCY\" which stands for electrified, autonomous, shared, connected, and yearly updated. The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as part of a global effort to promote environmentally friendly transportation by using renewable energy for charging. Advances in artificial intelligence and related technologies are expected to enable autonomous vehicles that can operate without human intervention, even in complex traffic scenarios. This development will redefine personal mobility, allowing for new applications and uses of vehicles. Additionally, the concept of car-sharing is projected to become more convenient and prevalent, especially with autonomous vehicles, allowing users to access vehicles on demand without needing ownership.\n\nThe report also highlights the trend of increasing connectivity of vehicles, both between cars and with infrastructure, which will enhance safety and efficiency. Passengers will have more opportunities to stay connected during their journeys, using vehicles for communication, work, and entertainment. Furthermore, the industry is expected to see an accelerated pace of innovation, with vehicles receiving updates annually, particularly in shared fleets, allowing for the continuous integration of the latest technological advancements. Overall, these changes will make mobility more accessible, affordable, and efficient.\n\nThe younger and technically savvy generation, especially in Europe, the United States, and particularly in China, in contrast to middle-aged individuals, will be a key driver in the development of sustainable and convenient mobility solutions in the coming years. In China, this shift is expected to be more rapid and dynamic due to favorable cultural and political conditions for technological change. By 2030, the number of traditional users in China is predicted to decline significantly, with the adoption of autonomous electric taxis and widespread electrification of public transport playing a major role in this transformation. In urban areas, China is expected to catch up with or even surpass the United States and Europe in terms of technological development. Factors such as high levels of air pollution and street congestion in Chinese cities are likely to accelerate the adoption of ride-sharing services and micro-mobility services, making them viable alternatives to traditional forms of mobility.\n\nStory continues\n\nA True Disruptor in the EV Market\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one the most popular EV companies known for its innovative technology, strong brand leadership, effective sales strategies, extensive charging infrastructure, and a diverse product lineup that meets the needs of various consumers. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been at the forefront of electric vehicle technology by offering high-performance cars with impressive range capabilities. The company was the first to introduce a long-range electric vehicle, the Model S, which significantly outperformed competitors in terms of mileage per charge. This innovation set a new standard in the EV market, making Tesla synonymous with high-quality electric vehicles that appeal to consumers looking for both performance and sustainability.\n\nTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitive advantage in the electric vehicle (EV) market is significantly strengthened by its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. The software not only enhances Tesla's vehicle offerings but also represents a potential high-margin, recurring revenue stream. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) commits to integrating FSD across its fleet to attract buyers and stand out in a competitive market. On July 29, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced that owners of vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 (HW3) will receive the Full Self-Driving (FSD) software version 12.5.1 within the next 1.5 weeks. Version 12.5.1 is expected to bring new features and improvements, including enhanced decision-making algorithms, improved path planning, and faster response times in dynamic traffic conditions. A core focus of the update is enhanced safety, with better object detection and real-time analytics to reduce accidents. The rollout will begin in the United States and gradually expand to other markets, including the UK, where Tesla will ensure compliance with local autonomous driving regulations. The release of FSD 12.5.1 marks a significant advancement in autonomous driving.\n\nBy 2030, we can expect a significant revolution in the automotive industry driven by autonomous electric taxis and the widespread adoption of electric public transport. As these trends converge, there will be a more accessible, affordable, and efficient mobility ecosystem. With that in context, let's take a look at the top automotive industry innovations and trends. The Top Automotive Industry Trend\n\nA line of electric vehicles being produced in a Massachusetts-based production facility.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of top automotive industry innovations and trends, we employed a consensus approach. We consulted more than 10 rankings on the internet to aggregate the top automotive industry innovations and trends. Of them, we picked items that appeared in 50% of our sources. Here is the list of top automotive industry innovations and trends.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Top Automotive Industry Trend\n\n1. Acceleration in Electric Vehicle Sales\n\nThe global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) has been the top-ranking trend in the automotive industry worldwide. According to research by RMI, global EV sales in Northern Europe and China will increase at least sixfold by 2030. China is on track to achieve 90% EV sales by 2030, with an increasing number of markets following similar growth trajectories to reach up to 80% by 2030. China sold more EVs last year than the rest of the world combined and projections indicate that 55% of all cars sold in Europe will be fully electric by 2030. Countries that adopted EVs later, such as India and Israel, are now accelerating their deployment at rates faster than the global average and are catching up with leaders like China. Major automakers are committing to producing only electric cars in the near future.\n\nCurious to learn about other top innovations and trends driving the global automotive industry?

The judge\u2019s comments bode poorly for Tesla whose lawyers were hoping to convince her to let Musk keep the record-breaking pay package with a renewed show of shareholder support.

        "title": "Tesla attorneys ask judge to vacate decision invalidating massive pay package for Elon Musk",
        "content": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) \u2014 Attorneys for Elon Musk and Tesla\u2019s corporate directors are asking a Delaware judge to vacate her ruling requiring the company to rescind a massive and unprecedented pay package for Musk.\n\nFriday's hearing follows a January ruling in which Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick concluded that Musk engineered the landmark 2018 pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, a sum that has fluctuated over the years but is now estimated to be worth more than $60 billion.\n\nFollowing the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin.\n\nDefense attorneys say the vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out in her January ruling, are adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package.\n\n\u201cHonoring the shoulder vote would affirm the strength of our corporate system,\u201d David Ross, an attorney for Musk and the other individual defendants, told McCormick. \u201cThis was stockholder democracy working.\u201d\n\nRoss told the judge that the defendants were not challenging the factual findings or legal conclusions in her ruling, but simply asking that she vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.\n\nMcCormick, however, seemed skeptical of the defense arguments, peppering attorneys with questions and noting that there is no precedent in Delaware law for allowing a post-trial shareholder vote to ratify adjudicated breaches of fiduciary duty by corporate directors.\n\n\u201cThis has never been done before,\u201d she said.\n\nDefense attorneys argued that while they could find no case that is exactly comparable, Delaware law has long recognized shareholder ratification as a cure to corporate governance errors, and has long acknowledged the \u201csovereignty\u201d of shareholders as the ultimate owners of a corporation.\n\n\u201cI candidly don\u2019t see how Delaware law can tell the owners of the company that they\u2019re not entitled to make the decision they made,\u201d said Rudolf Koch, an attorney for Tesla.\n\nDonald Verrilli, a lawyer for an induvial stockholder who owns more than 19,000 Tesla shares, suggested that it would be wrong for the lone shareholder who filed the lawsuit to thwart the will of the majority of Tesla shareholders. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff owned just nine shares of Tesla stock.\n\n\u201cThe voice of the majority of shareholders should matter\u2026. This lawsuit is not representing the interest of the shareholders,\" Verrilli said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThomas Grady, an attorney for a group of Florida objectors who own or manage almost 8 million Tesla shares with some $2 billion, argued that for McCormick to rule for the plaintiff, she has to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d all other Tesla shareholders.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, who are seeking unprecedented legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion, were to argue their case Friday afternoon.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech stocks take a pounding as hedge fund Elliott warns AI trades like Nvidia are in \u2018bubble land\u2019",
        "content": "The unwinding of the AI trade, triggered by a recent run of disappointing quarterly earnings, has turned into a bloodbath for Big Tech.\n\nWhat began with Tesla and Google has now gathered steam with selloffs spreading across all major cloud computing and semiconductor stocks, led by Intel. The chipmaker suspended its dividend on Thursday and pledged to cut 15,000 jobs, leading to today\u2019s 27% drop\u2014its worst for a single day in decades.\n\nSentiment worsened after the Financial Times obtained on Friday a recent letter from hedge fund Elliott Management reportedly telling investors that Nvidia and the entire megacap tech sector was living in \u201cbubble land\u201d with artificial intelligence \u201coverhyped.\u201d\n\nAlthough Nvidia may have lost more than 20% from its high in June, putting it in bear market territory, those losses only wipe out roughly two months of gains. It is still trading well above levels seen during most of May and has more than doubled in price since January, an indication that valuations may have become overextended, as Elliott warned.\n\nNvidia, whose shares traded roughly in line with the 2.7% drop in the Nasdaq, declined to comment to Fortune on the report. The asset manager couldn\u2019t be reached.\n\nA darkening economic outlook hasn\u2019t helped Nvidia or its peers in the chip industry either. Belief is mounting that monetary policy is overly restrictive with the overnight interbank lending rate set by the Federal Reserve\u00a0last fixed at 5.33%, some 230 basis points above the June consumer price index, which measures the rate of inflation.\n\nAmazon and Tesla look to make their own AI training chips\n\nSymptomatic of a new trend to sell into strength, chip designer Arm Holdings reported on Wednesday a\u00a039% gain in quarterly revenue, only to see it lose a quarter of its value this week alone. Growth forecasts had only met analyst expectations\u2014a sign that the market got ahead of itself.\n\nFundamentally, little has changed for Nvidia. Its AI training and inference chips are still coveted for their unparalleled ability to crunch the terabytes of data needed to power generative AI. In fact they might even be too good. CEO Jensen Huang is struggling to keep up with the pace of demand, prompting tech companies to invest in their own microchips as a kind of plan B.\n\nElon Musk said last week that Tesla\u2019s voracious demand for Huang\u2019s H100 processors to power its upcoming data center in Austin means the carmaker will double down on investment in its Dojo chip. Optimized for training neural networks based on video data rather than text, Tesla hopes its proprietary design will solve autonomous driving if Nvidia cannot.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he was also funding his own chips.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep partnership with Nvidia,\u201d Jassy told investors on\u00a0Thursday. \u201cBut we\u2019ve heard loud and clear from investors that they relish better price performance. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Revenge Of The Rest: These Three S&P 493 Stocks Are Set To Pop\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nU.S. equities have been dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" accounting for the majority of the gains for the benchmark S&P 500 index. The highly esteemed group comprises seven of the largest companies in the U.S.: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThese tech titans make up about a third of the index\u2019s total value, overshadowing the performance of the other 493 companies. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has gained over 37% year-to-date, overshadowing the broader index's 15.8% returns over this period.\n\nCheck It Out: When today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nHowever, concerns regarding the potential overvaluation of the tech heavyweights have been racking investors, causing the S&P 500 index to decline by nearly 30 basis points over the past month.\n\nNonetheless, analysts are bullish on the remaining 493 stocks in the index.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re seeing a diverging trend between the Magnificent Seven and the [S&P] 493 happening this quarter. The other 493 were basically in an earnings recession up until last quarter. We expect this earnings season is going to be the first quarter for the other 493 to post positive earnings growth since Q4 of \u201922, whereas the Mag 7, their earnings growth is expected to decelerate for the second straight quarter and again in Q3. And by Q4 of this year consensus points to basically similar growth rates between the two and I think that will really be the catalyst for the rotation in the market to take place,\u201d said Ohsung Kwon, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Securities.\n\nAmong the S&P 493, several dividend stocks stand out as potential winners in this expected market rotation.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has been steadily investing in its 5G network. The company added 391,000 total broadband connections in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, marking the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband additions. Verizon's total broadband subscribers stood at 11.5 million as of the end of the second quarter, reflecting a 17.2% rise from the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon pays $2.66 in dividends annually, yielding 6.64% on the current price. The company is currently on track to becoming a dividend aristocrat, as it has raised its dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years as of 2023.\n\n\"Our consistently disciplined approach to driving strong cash flow, operating the business, and serving our customers has once again put the Board in a position to raise the dividend,\" Verizon's Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a news release, \"We continue to deliver value to our shareholders as we execute our network-as-a-service strategy.\"\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation\u2019s 1%.

Don\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to understand the art market dynamics.\n\nWalgreens\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading pharmacy chain, had been a long-standing Dividend Aristocrat until earlier this year when it slashed its quarterly dividend payouts by 48% to 25 cents per share. The company currently pays $1 per share in dividends annually, yielding 8.22% on the current price.\n\nBefore the dividend cut in January 2024, Walgreens was on track to becoming a Dividend King, having raised its dividends for 47 consecutive years.\n\nHowever, the company has been focusing on bolstering its growth prospects by expanding its health care services, including partnerships with primary care providers and investments in digital health initiatives.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to reduce our quarterly dividend payment to 25 cents per share, to strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position. This action reinforces our goal of increasing cash flow while freeing up capital to invest in sustainable growth initiatives in our pharmacy and health care businesses, which we believe will ultimately improve shareholder value,\" said Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, in a news release.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a global pharmaceutical giant, has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 with its vaccine development. As of December 2023, Pfizer currently pays $1.68 in dividends annually, yielding 5.35% on the current price. The company has increased its dividend for 15 years in a row.\n\nHowever, as COVID-19-related growth subsides, Pfizer's earnings have been declining. The company's net income amounted to $2.33 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 98% decline year-over-year. This comes as the pandemic-driven momentum wanes, causing Pfizer's profit margins to dwindle.\n\nNonetheless, analysts expect the company's earnings to rise in the near term at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% per annum over the next five years.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "title": "Elon Musk is opening a Montessori school in Texas this fall",
        "content": "A new Montessori school is opening outside of Austin, backed by Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tesla CEO cofounded the school, which will open on a 40-acre property in Bastrop, Texas, that used to be a horse ranch. Bastrop is also the home of Musk\u2019s Boring Company.\n\nThe school, named Ad Astra, will be open to children between the ages of 3 and 9, and will focus on science, technology, engineering, and math. Applications are being accepted now, with the school tentatively beginning classes in September.\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u2019s mission is to foster curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking in the next generation of problem solvers and builders,\u201d the school\u2019s website proclaims.\n\nOnly 50 students will be accepted: 18 between the aged of 3 and 6, and 30 lower-elementary students between 6 and 9.\n\nMusk moved to Texas in 2020, after growing frustrated with California during the pandemic. He has become so enamored with the Lone Star State that he\u2019s also in the process of building his own town, which would become a de facto suburb of Austin. Musk has reportedly bought thousands of acres of land about 35 miles outside of the city, adjacent to the Boring and SpaceX facilities under construction in the area.\n\nThe proposed municipality is said to already include some modular homes. Signs hang from poles reading \u201cwelcome, snailbrook, tx, est. 2021.\u201d Snailbrook is the name of Boring\u2019s mascot.\n\nMusk reportedly wants to offer rental houses to workers at well below local averages. One ad allegedly put the price of a two- or three-bedroom home at $800, compared to $2,200 a month in Bastrop.\n\nTexas law requires an area to have at least 201 residents before it can incorporate. Plans reportedly call for the construction of 110 more homes in the area where Snailbrook is located.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if his investment in the Montessori school is tied with the in-the-works suburb.\n\nMusk\u2019s anchor to the area is the Gigafactory manufacturing facility in Austin. The facility covers 2,500 acres along the Colorado River with over 10 million square feet of factory floor. That makes it the second-largest building in the world.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

That\u2019s up both from a year ago and from June, when Tesla recorded its third consecutive drop in shipments from its factory.\n\nTesla\u2019s pace of production in China is still lower than it was through the first seven months of last year, reflecting slowing demand for the company\u2019s electric vehicles. Elon Musk has placed greater emphasis lately on artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicle development, though those efforts may take longer to bear fruit. The chief executive officer confirmed in July that he\u2019d postponed an event to unveil robotaxi prototypes by about two months to October.\n\nTesla shares fell 2.6% as of 9 a.m. Friday in New York, before the start of regular trading. The stock has dropped 13% this year.\n\nBYD extended its lead in China\u2019s new-energy vehicle market, increasing sales by 31% from a year ago to 340,799 units. While plug-in hybrid deliveries jumped 67% in July to 210,799 cars, the company\u2019s battery-electric vehicle sales fell to their lowest in five months.\n\nIndustrywide, China\u2019s sales of new-energy vehicles \u2014 which comprises plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars \u2014 rose 29% from a year ago, with automakers getting a boost toward the end of the month from Beijing doubling a subsidy paid out to consumers trading in older autos.\n\nSeveral carmakers reported declines on a month-to-month basis, with Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.\u2019s Zeekr delivering 15,655 vehicles in July, down 22% from June.\n\nA Zeekr spokesperson said that equipment checks and production line repairs are usually timed for the summer months. Zeekr\u2019s factory lines also are being adjusted to make several new models, the spokesperson said, adding that the company is still targeting a monthly run rate of 30,000 units for sometime in the fourth quarter.\n\nZeekr\u2019s parent Geely reported a 9.2% dip in July sales while Great Wall Motor Co. posted a 6.9% drop from June.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina\u2019s Passenger Car Association estimated that new-energy passenger vehicle wholesales slipped about 3% month-on-month, amid slower economic growth and muted consumer spending.\n\nAmong China\u2019s other three US-listed EV makers \u2014 Nio Inc., Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. \u2014 the latter stood out, posting a 6.8% month-on-month increase largely driven by the popularity of its extended-range EVs.

        "title": "Tesla\u2019s Market Share Plunge: Time to Sell This Overpriced Stock?",
        "content": "There are 58 analysts covering Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. Of those, 24 still rate it a Buy. Amazingly, the average price target of the analysts is $213.45, 4% below where it is currently trading.\n\nHow is it possible 24 of 55 Wall Street analysts have a Buy on the stock and yet, their target prices are below where it\u2019s trading?\n\nTesla continues to lose market share as the EV industry matures and more of the competition find their financial footing because of a combination of higher sales and better expense control.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to recent reporting from Fortune, Tesla\u2019s U.S. EV market share in Q2 2024 fell below 50% for the first time. While its U.S. sales were down 6.3% in the second quarter, EV sales across the board in the U.S. were up 11.3%.\n\nAt what point do analysts stop giving Tesla a Buy rating just because Elon Musk is CEO? How much market share does Tesla have to lose before analysts act?\n\nLet\u2019s consider that question.\n\nTesla Stock Compared with GM\n\nTo give us some historical perspective on market share in the U.S. automotive industry, let\u2019s consider General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) market share.\n\nAs recently as 1962, it was over 50%, around the same level as Tesla\u2019s current share of the U.S. EV market. That marked is much smaller based on the number of vehicles sold in a given quarter or month. In 2009, the year GM filed for bankruptcy, its market share had fallen below 20% to 19.8%.\n\nAs of December 2023, its market share was 16.2%. Last year, GM sold 2.6 million vehicles in the U.S., 14% higher than a year earlier. By comparison, Tesla sold 670,000 vehicles in 2023, about one-quarter GM\u2019s output.\n\nGiven all these statistics between the two companies, it\u2019s easy to see why 66% of analysts covering GM rate it a Buy compared to 49% for Tesla.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Tesla got the benefit of the doubt from analysts for a long time because it participates in and dominates an industry that\u2019s still young and fairly immature. It shouldn\u2019t any longer.\n\nCan Tesla Ever Catch GM\u2019s Production Numbers?\n\nUnless GM CEO Mary Barra totally botches EVs, it isn\u2019t going to happen in my lifetime, or any lifetime thereafter. The lead is too great for Tesla to overcome knowing that GM\u2019s EV strategy is slowly coming together.\n\nGM reported its Q2 2024 production results in early July. It delivered 696,086 vehicles in the second quarter, up 0.6% from a year earlier. Its EV sales grew 40% YOY and 34% higher than Q1 to 21,930, or 3.2% of total deliveries.\n\nThat\u2019s impressive considering it dropped the Chevy Bolt EV, from its lineup after 2023, delivering 62,044 of the economical EV last year in the U.S., up from 38,122 in 2022. The next generation Bolt will be out summer of 2025. It\u2019s expected to be the cheapest EV ever sold in the American market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorse still for Tesla, GM will have 10 EV nameplates by the end of the year, including the Equinox EV, which has already become its highest volume EV in just one month.\n\nOne of the benefits of being a legacy automaker is that you have a bunch of nameplates that you can produce EV versions for, maintaining the customer engagement.\n\nTesla has to almost start from scratch with each new vehicle, and while new has its advantages, legacy brand awareness is helping GM\u2019s EV strategy moving into the second half 2024.\n\nAs I said, unless something happens to mess up GM\u2019s strategy, Tesla will always be chasing GM, something that should make investors question their investment in Tesla stock.\n\nTesla\u2019s Valuation Is Stretched\n\nWhile GM\u2019s EV strategy continues to evolve and grow, you can\u2019t say the same about Tesla. Sure, it\u2019s got Cybertruck to remind investors that it can do new vehicles, and it does have the robotaxi business, but can it do new vehicles that don\u2019t break the bank? So far, the answer is no.\n\nYet its valuation is Magnificent Seven-worthy.\n\n\u201cTesla, by share price, is the most valuable automaker in the world. Its market cap is higher than the next nine most valuable automakers \u2013 Toyota, BYD, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, BMW, Volkswagen, Stellantis, and General Motors \u2013 combined,\u201d Jalopnik contributor Amber DaSilva recently wrote.\n\nHistorically, Tesla stock\u2019s been valued like a tech business, not a maker of cars and trucks. There is an argument to be made that this is no longer the case. Perhaps the eventual lauch of the robotaxi will help on that front.\n\nIn the meantime, well-known investor Bill Gross has called it the newest meme stock, and he wasn\u2019t being complimentary.\n\nTrading at 59x cash flow \u2013 GM trades at 2.6x cash flow \u2013 Tesla stock is not a buy at these prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The case, if it goes to trial, could shine a light on the way short sellers use social media and help draw a line between legitimate commentary and intentional manipulation.\n\nHere are some of the tweets at the center in the indictment:\n\nRoku \u2018Uninvestible\u2019\n\nEarly in the morning on Jan. 8, 2019, Left opened short positions in Roku Inc., the maker of TV streaming boxes and software, setting him up to profit if the stock were to fall, prosecutors say. At 9:41 a.m., Left posted on Citron\u2019s Twitter account that Roku was \u201cuninvestible,\u201d according to the indictment. Left soon deleted the tweet and, the US says, \u201cfalsely and misleadingly\u201d posted this instead:\n\n\u201cTo clarify, we are watching ROKU from the side.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nLeft made at least $700,000 from his Roku trades that morning, prosecutors say.\n\nBeyond \u2018Stupid\u2019\n\nLeft began building a short position in Beyond Meat Inc. in mid-May 2019, according to the indictment. Then, on May 17 at 1:50 p.m., Left ripped into the maker of plant-based meat substitutes on Citron\u2019s Twitter account, as noted in the indictment, mocking the company and predicting it would suffer from a new competitor:\n\n\u201c$BYND has become Beyond Stupid. Most heavily traded retail stock on Robinhood, market cap now bigger than industry, and superior competitor coming to market soon. We expect $BYND to go back to $65 on earnings On retail exhaustion. [Look]\u201d\n\nThe short seller quickly began closing his position in Beyond Meat in Citron\u2019s trading account, according to prosecutors. Within 12 minutes of posting the tweet, Left sold the $90 put options that expired the same day, the US says.\n\nAmerican \u2018Upside Down\u2019\n\nLeft opened short positions in American Airlines Group Inc. in his trading accounts around June 5, 2020, prosecutors say. He also purchased short-dated $19 and $20 put options that expired the same day, as the airline was trading at about $20, according to the indictment. At 11:54 a.m., Left allegedly took to Twitter to blast the airline\u2019s balance sheet:\n\n\u201c$AAL Back to $10 Robinhood traders have 0 idea what they [sic] buying. Balance sheet is upside down. Unencumbered assets worth far less than current price. The reason why Buffett fully exited lower. They don\u2019t teach finance in the Sherwood Forest.\u201d\n\nLeft completely closed his pre-tweet trades in the airline by about 12:37 p.m., for a profit of at least $429,000, the US says.\n\nCannabis \u2018Dark Side\u2019\n\nLeft began building a short position in Cronos Group Inc. on Aug. 29, 2018, a few days after he wrote to a hedge fund portfolio manager that \u201cwe can make money in weed\u201d and \u201cwe can DESTROY\u201d Cronos, according to the indictment. On Aug. 30, 2018, at 10:07 a.m., Left used Citron\u2019s Twitter account to post a link to a Citron short report and said:\n\n\u201c$CRON tgt price $3.5. Everything that is contaminated about the Cannabis space. ALL HYPE with possible securities fraud . . . .\u201d\n\nAt the time of the tweet, Cronos was trading at about $11.50 a share. About an hour later, Left used Twitter again to promote his short position on the weed company and upcoming TV appearance, prosecutors say.\n\n\u201cAndrew Left from Citron on CNBC Fast Money 5:25pm ET to discuss why $CRON is the most overhyped of all the \u2018pot stocks\u2019 with a target price of $3.5[.]\u201d\n\nLeft began closing his short position on Cronos about 24 minutes after posting the first tweet, according to the indictment. By the end of the day, Left had reduced his pre-tweet position in the company by about 61%, the US said. The next day, Left wrote to another person that his commentary was like taking \u201ccandy from a baby\u201d because Cronos was popular with retail traders, the US said.\n\nSpertus pointed to Left\u2019s reports, which the tweets link to, saying they included a disclaimer that people shouldn\u2019t trade based on what he says. He added that Left only tweeted or issued reports that include public information.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the publisher. It\u2019s not inside information,\u201d Spertus said. \u201cIt\u2019s discovery from public information that he puts into the marketplace.\u201d\n\nLong on Tesla\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2018, Left took to Twitter to promote his long position on Tesla and included a link to a Citron report on Elon Musk\u2019s electric car maker, which at the time was trading at about $266, according to the indictment:\n\n\u201c$TSLA dropping earnings on top of $F tomorrow might be a bad sign for shorts. After reviewing all recent info on $TSLA dominating its categories, Citron is LONG Tesla for this quarter.\u201d\n\nBut within a minute, he placed an order to sell call options for about 120,000 shares \u2014 more than half of his pre-tweet position \u2014 reaping about $1 million in profit, according to the indictment. By the close of the next trading day, Left sold about 81% of his pre-tweet position for a profit of at least $6.6 million, the US said.\n\nNvidia \u2018Oversold\u2019\n\nOn Nov. 20, 2018, Left allegedly received a message from someone identified only as \u201cIndividual C\u201d who asked him if he wanted to \u201cmake some fast money\u201d by commenting on Nvidia Corp., according to the indictment. At 10:17 a.m., just after he opened long positions on Nvidia, prosecutors said Left used Citron\u2019s Twitter account to promote the company as a favorable investment.\n\n\u201cCitron buys $NVDA. This is the first time in 2 years stock offers an appealing risk-reward to investors... We see $165 before we see $120.\u201d At the time, NVDA\u2019s stock was trading at approximately $144.\n\nDespite Left\u2019s assertion that he expected Nvidia\u2019s share price to rise to $165, less than two hours after his announcement about a share purchase, Left allegedly sold all of his pre-tweet positions in his trading accounts. At that point, the company was trading between $150 and $151. He made a profit of at least $930,000, prosecutors say.\n\nFacebook Addiction\n\nOn Dec. 26, 2018, Left opened a long position in Facebook, the indictment shows. Prosecutors alleged that two days later, at 9:52 a.m., Left used Citron\u2019s Twitter account to post a link to a positive report on the company\u2019s outlook that downplayed social-media addiction concerns about children:\n\n\u201c$FB Backing up the sleigh. $160 tgt. Citron presents the only information that counts on $FB looking past the rhetoric. Would you rather have your kids addicted to Nicotine or Instagram? Wall St answer will amaze you[.]\u201d\n\nAt the time of the tweet, Facebook\u2019s stock was trading at about $129, the US says. Left allegedly started closing his position in Facebook within hours of posting the tweet, selling about 89% of his shares as the company was trading between $130 and $134. Within two days Left had sold all of his pre-tweet long positions for a profit of at least $680,000, the US says.\n\n--With assistance from Tom Schoenberg.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter \u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ark's Cathie Wood is Buying This Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Shares of electric vehicle (EV), energy storage, and artificial intelligence (AI) company Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) are trading down about 40% from their peak. Slumping sales in the company's EV segment, which currently provides the lion's share of its revenue and earnings, have dampened Wall Street's enthusiasm for the stock, despite the company's potential in robotics and autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nHowever, Cathie Wood, who manages billions of dollars for Ark Investment Management, is buying Tesla stock hand over fist for her firm's exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Since the end of 2023, Ark's total Tesla position has grown from 3.8 million shares to 5.3 million.\n\nWood built her reputation in part on her foresight about Tesla stock. So should investors follow her lead now and buy it for its alleged AI upside?\n\nWood has won big on Tesla before\n\nWood founded Ark Invest in 2014. The firm operates several actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), most of which focus on various categories of growing, innovative companies. Its flagship fund is the Ark Innovation ETF. Between 2017 and 2019, Wood invested heavily in Tesla, which was at the time fending off bankruptcy as it ramped up Model 3 production.\n\nTesla worked through its challenges, the business thrived, and the stock gained nearly 1,500% over three years beginning in January 2019: TSLA Chart\n\nBut Ark's reputation has suffered since then. Market sentiment about speculative growth stocks plummeted as the Fed boosted interest rates to fight inflation, and their valuations plunged too. Many of Ark's holdings remain down significantly from their former highs. The Ark Innovation ETF has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 since early 2022.\n\nNow, however, Wood appears to be leaning into Tesla once more, hoping for a big win to get her funds back on track. Her new investment thesis for Tesla credits it with eye-popping investment potential.\n\nWhy Wood thinks it will happen again\n\nArk updated its long-term Tesla forecast this year, pegging its expected value in 2029 at $2,600 per share. That's over 10 times the company's value today.\n\nBoth CEO Elon Musk and Wood have high hopes for Tesla's autonomous driving technology. On the Q2 earnings call, Musk went so far as to say that investors should sell their Tesla stock if they don't believe the company will be able to bring a self-driving EV to market, because \"the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy.\" Likewise, Ark's projections estimate that approximately 90% of Tesla's enterprise value and earnings will derive from autonomy by 2029.\n\nStory continues\n\nAutonomy, also called full self-driving, would create high-margin revenue opportunities for Tesla, potentially offsetting the impact of lower-margin electric vehicle sales. It could launch a robotaxi business that could threaten traditional ride-sharing models by dramatically reducing operating costs. Tesla plans to unveil its robotaxi EV in October.\n\nTesla has been developing this technology for the past decade, but strides in AI over the past couple of years have accelerated its progress. The company's version 12 software is allegedly a tremendous improvement; Tesla rewrote its software to use neural net technology instead of code to interpret the vehicle's surroundings.\n\nShould investors buy Tesla today?\n\nTesla is arguably overvalued today based on its recent earnings. However, the company's lofty goals and public profile have won it an investor base that seems to focus more on its long-term story than its quarterly financials. That doesn't mean shareholders are misguided; Tesla is notorious for missing promise dates, but it has eventually delivered often enough that the stock has outperformed the market.\n\nElon Musk is arguably Tesla's greatest long-term advantage and risk. Musk built Tesla into what it is today. On the other hand, Musk is a highly public and outspoken figure who occasionally attracts criticism that unnecessarily exposes Tesla to bad publicity. It's an unfair and frustrating situation for shareholders who must take the good with the bad. In June, investors voted to reinstate Musk's $44.9 billion pay package, a sign that shareholders still feel Tesla is better with Musk than without him.\n\nSo, should investors buy Tesla today? It boils down to a simple question: Do you believe the company will deliver autonomous driving technology to the market?\n\nThe bottom line is that Tesla is a stock with a wide range of potential long-term outcomes. Maybe Ark's projections are over-optimistic. Even so, Tesla shares could still deliver strong returns from here if the company produces an autonomous driving system that meets regulators' (and customers') standards, and launches a robotaxi service. However, investors should also acknowledge the risks and downsides if it fails to clear the remaining technological hurdles.\n\nThose who believe in Tesla's autonomous driving vision should consider building their positions in the stock slowly and steadily using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. They should also hold it as a small part of a diverse portfolio. If Ark's projections prove even remotely close to accurate, you won't need much Tesla stock to enjoy portfolio-changing returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Top 3 EV Charging Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "For many years, the electric vehicle (EV) industry, including EV charging stocks, has been plagued by two main adoption obstacles. Those include cars looking awkward and high upfront cost. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) largely changed the shift for the former. But battery costs are still exerting a heavy toll on people\u2019s EV perception.\n\nNonetheless, fans of quiet driving and cheap upkeep continue to show up. S&P Global forecasted that battery electric vehicles (BEV) will see growth by nearly 40% in 2024 compared to 2023. Likewise, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasted global EV penetration to increase to 17% by the end of 2025, compared to tiny 2% in 2020.\n\nWhether that results as a pure play BEV like Tesla, its cheap BYD competition like Seagull, or Toyota-like hybrids, EVs will need a developed charging infrastructure.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce the cost of batteries decreases (Goldman says 40% by 2025 from end-2023), alongside new battery tech advances like solid-state, companies in charge of charging EVs are poised to balloon.\n\nThese three EV charging stocks have the best shot at rising.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNearly half of the U.S. population lives within a close distance of 10 miles from an EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) charging station. This EV infrastructure company runs an owner-operator business model, with over 1,000 fast-charging locations.\n\nSimilar to a software as a service (SaaS) model, EVgo offers four tiers of monetization. It starts with free Pay As You Go that charges 99 cents per session to EVgo PlusMax charging $12.99 monthly for frequent EV users. As owner-operator, EVgo is in control of its charging infrastructure, able to fine-tune the balance between user feedback and maintenance.\n\nSince fast-charging takes longer than filling up a fuel tank, the company routinely sets up collaborations with retail and commercial property owners. It aims to strategically position charging stations and increase traffic to partner businesses. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) partnership to leverage Alexa\u2019s AI since January 2023. Also, BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), Honda (NYSE:HMC) and GM (NYSE:GM) drivers are incentivized with EVgo credits.\n\nIn the latest Q1 of fiscal year 2024 earnings delivered in May, EVgo reported a record 118% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase to $55.2 million. The company\u2019s charging network delivered 53 GWh of electricity, which is a 194% YOY increase. Although EVgo still reported a net loss of $28.2 million, it is a 43% YOY improvement over the net loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with added 109,000 accounts in the quarter, EVgo\u2019s heavy capital expenditures are likely to start paying of in the near future. Presently priced at $3.62, EVGO stock is up 56% in the last six months.\n\nAbove the 52-week average of $2.86, EVGO shares still have some way to go to reach the 52-week high of $5.95 per share. Nasdaq\u2019s forecasting consensus puts the average EVGO price target at $4.33 with $7 as the ceiling.\n\nEaton Corp. (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreatly diversified, Eaton Corp. (NYSE:ETN) is one of the safest EV charging stocks to buy. Not only does the company manufacture critical components for aerospace, both military and commercial, but also its end-to-end supply of electrical systems covers broader industrial and residential markets.\n\nIn addition to charging software, Eaton Corp. develops and deploys AC and DC chargers and facility\u2019s power management systems. This includes home chargers like the compact Power Xpert EVX wallbox. In March, Eaton expanded with its launch of Green Motion DC fast chargers. These are able to simultaneously charge two vehicles at each side of the compact station.\n\nAhead of the Q2 earnings report on August 1st, Eaton Corp. beat four consecutive EPS estimates, with the Q1 earnings per share of $2.04 and adjusted EPS of $2.40. The company delivered 8% YOY organic sales growth and 27% backlog growth in the Electrical division.\n\nOf course, given the massive U.S. defense budget, Eaton Corp. also reported 11% aerospace growth. With a segment margins YOY improvement of 340 bp, and free cash flow increase by 40% to $292, Eaton Corp. makes a compelling investing case.\n\nOver the last six months, ETN stock is up, presently priced at $297.88, well-above the 52-week average and closing in on the 52-week high of $345.19. Nasdaq\u2019s average ETN price target is $343.17 per share.\n\nWallbox N.V. (WBX) An iPhone screen with the Wallbox (WBX) logo on it in front of a computer screen.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs an exposure to Europe\u2019s take on EV charging infrastructure, Spanish Wallbox N.V. (NYSE:WBX) represents a key player in the EV charging stocks market. It supplies the global market with fast and ultrafast chargers for both homes and public use.\n\nFor example, U.K.\u2019s TopCharger magazine gave Pulsar Plus 4.2 stars out of five. Not only is it built with robustness in mind, but also it has wide connectivity. This includes Google Assistant and bluetooth/Wi-Fi to Apple Watch and Android Wear app.\n\nLike Eaton Corp., Wallbox N.V. released its Q2 earnings today. In the Q1 report, WBX delivered 23% more YOY sales, having improved realized gross margin by 600 bp after reducing the cost of labor and operating expenses at 21% and 30%, respectively. With the launch of Supernova 180 DC fast charger and Pulsar Pro in North America, Wallbox N.V. expects further growth.\n\nPresently priced at $1.46, WBX stock has one of the highest potential gains, making it the top EV charging stock to buy. While the current price is under the 52-week average of $1.78, Nasdaq\u2019s forecasting consensus places average WBX price target at $4.13, with even the bottom of $3.25 indicating at least 2x gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) The Best Stock to Invest In According to Ark Invest?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Ark Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against Ark Invest's other stocks picks.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that Cathie Wood's investment approach is one of the most unique on Wall Street. In a finance industry dominated by long, short, value, and growth plays, Wood focuses primarily on high growth stocks which she and her firm believe hold the keys to the future. This has seen Ark Investment, whose latest SEC filings had a cumulative value of $14.4 billion, see some of its investments grow in triple digit percentages while others have floundered.\n\nIn fact, we analyzed the long term performance of Cathie Wood's top stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. This piece analyzed Wood and her firm's top 13F investments during Q4 2020 and checked their performance over the past three years. Out of these ten stocks, just one was in the green while nearly all others had lost most of their value or were down in red.\n\nDuring this time, some of Wood's predictions on the economy also stood at odds with the general consensus among Federal Reserve officials and other members of the finance industry. As a recap, the Fed started to aggressively raise interest rates in 2022 as part of its efforts to combat inflation. This caused a lot of pain for growth investors like Wood, as technology stocks started to fall. In June 2022, which saw the Fed announce a 75 basis point hike, which was the largest since 1994, Wood admitted that she was wrong about inflation. This acceptance came after her remarks in October 2021 on social media, in which she disputed Twitter (now X) founder Jack Dorsey's assessment that the US economy was headed for hyperinflation. While Dorsey's worries turned out to be a bit too extreme as well, Wood countered by stating:\n\n\u201cIn 2008-09, when the Fed started quantitative easing, I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead, velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined, taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling.\u201d\n\nShe added that three factors would force deflation. These were technologically \"enabled innovation\" driving down costs and making businesses postpone their spending, over leveraged firms selling subpar goods at below market prices, and businesses over ordering in response to the pandemic. These factors led her to conclude that \"once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies, prices should unwind.\"\n\nOf course, as it turned out, prices in America shot to record high levels in October 2022 and devastated technology stocks in their wake. One of the worst hit sectors was the semiconductor industry, and had it not been for the popularity of artificial intelligence, then these stocks would have spent 2023 recovering from their record lows in the prior year.\n\nShifting gears to analyze Wood's performance in 2024, her flagship fund is down 10.95% year to date. This stands in sharp comparison to the S&P benchmark's and the tech heavy NASDAQ's 15.20% year to date appreciation. In fact, the latter index is made of 100 of the most valuable technology stocks, so the fact that Wood's flagship fund is down means that her focus on the extreme end of the innovation spectrum is still proving to be a bit too risky for a market that has dealt with the brunt of multi decade high interest rates over the past couple of years.\n\nBut what about stocks? Cathie Wood invests in a variety of stocks, ranging from video communications to gene editing and artificial intelligence. So perhaps some of her top stock picks of 2024 have done better during Q1 and Q2 as the market starts to comfortably price expectations for an interest rate cut in September. Well, the top five Cathie Wood stocks that you'll find out about more as you read through this piece are mostly down. Their performance is -6.57%, 49%, -33.8%, -15.90%, and -5.63%, respectively, with the only stock in the green belonging to a financial trading platform provider that has benefited from the growing market adoption of Bitcoin. For some cryptocurrency stocks that are seeing love from analysts, you can check out 11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nWhile simply analyzing the year to date performance of her top five stocks is an easy way to form an opinion about Cathie Wood's latest investment strategy, we can also expand our focus to see which stocks she has positioned herself into as the Fed heads to an interest rate cuts. Insider Monkey's research shows that during Q2 2024, Cathie Wood bought eight new stocks. Additionally, she has also invested in an ETF linked to 7-10 year US Treasury bonds and two exchange traded funds (ETFs) linked to Ethereum. So, which stocks is Cathie Wood buying as the Fed nears an interest rate cut?\n\nWell, out of the eight new stocks that she bought in 2024's second quarter, two belonged to the 3D printing industry (one of these ranked 4th in our coverage of the top 3D printing stocks), another is a healthcare play that claims to have \"world's largest library of clinical & molecular data,\" followed by a cybersecurity stock, a digital promotions software provider, the 6thbest SaaS stock to buy according to hedge funds, the 6th stock on this list which is another AI and software play, and the 3rdbest undervalued stock to buy according to Reddit. Looking at their year to date performance, it is -33.42% and -77.7% for the 3D printing stocks, 8.99% for the healthcare play, and -6.49%, -35%, 2.47%, -7.49%, and -4.10%, respectively. As Wood would like to remind you, past performance is not an indicator of future returns, so whether she's positioning herself for a recovery in most of these stocks on the back of a lighter monetary and economic environment is up for you to decide.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of Ark Invest and Cathie Wood's latest stock picks, we picked out the ten most valuable positions from Ark Invest's Q2 2024 investment portfolio.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 74\n\nArk Investment Management\u2019s Q2 2024 Stake: $1 billion\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most diversified car companies in the world. While its primary line of business is making and selling electric cars, it has also positioned itself well to benefit from any growth in renewable energy storage and artificial intelligence. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the earliest movers in the AI industry courtesy of its assisted driving software FSD's reliance on machine learning to help users with their driving needs. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s latest quarter saw it reap the benefits of this diversification, as while its automotive revenue dropped by 7% annually to sit at $21.2 billion, energy storage doubled and grew by 100% to sit at $1.5 billion. However, this still makes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an EV stock, and this brings with it the complexities of having to deal with the dependence on consumer purchasing power, the lithium supply chain, and tough competition in markets such as China.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk made some telling comments during the Q2 2024 earnings call where he shared that he had no choice but to compete with NVIDIA due to the tight GPU supply chain:\n\n\"Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I\u2019m incredibly impressed by NVIDIA\u2019s execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it\u2019s often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this, I guess I\u2019m quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have \u2014 in order to ensure that we\u2019ve got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo. And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and the \u2014 it\u2019s obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high. So, I think we\u2019ve really got to make Dojo work and we will.\"\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of Ark Invest's top 10 stock picks. You can visit Ark Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Picksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Tech giants faced major market cap drop in July on earnings worries",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Global mega tech companies' market capitalisation dropped sharply in July, in response to disappointing quarterly results and concerns over high valuations, prompting investors to shift their focus away from the AI sector.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, investors pushed tech stocks higher on expectations that AI advancements would boost earnings. But the second-quarter earnings reports from tech companies have raised concerns that investment in AI infrastructure has led to ballooning costs with only modest gains.\n\nMicrosoft reported revenue that fell short of analysts' expectations, while Tesla reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years. Additionally, Google's parent company, Alphabet, experienced a slowdown in advertising sales at YouTube, raising concerns about Alphabet's ability to expand its margins.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet's market capitalisations fell by about 6% to $3.1 trillion and $2.1 trillion, respectively, at the end of July, based on LSEG data.\n\nSlowing profits among its major customers dampened growth expectations for chipmaker Nvidia, leading to a 5.2% reduction in its market cap to $2.8 trillion. This downturn also impacted its Taiwanese production partner TSMC, the world's largest third-party microchip foundry, which experienced a 4.3% decrease in market cap to $737.8 billion at the end of July.\n\nBucking the trend, Apple's market cap surged 5.4% to $3.4 trillion at the end of July, fuelled by optimism that its new AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, would boost sales and encourage customers to upgrade their devices to utilize the new technology.\n\nBut then Nvidia added about $330 billion in stock market value on Wednesday, a record one-day gain for any company on Wall Street after Microsoft and Advanced Micro Devices reignited the AI rally.\n\nOutside the tech sector, drug maker Eli Lilly's market capitalisation fell 11.2% to $764.3 billion, amid concerns about its lead in the anti-obesity market being challenged by a promising experimental pill from rival Roche.\n\nDespite weak results, Tesla's market cap increased by 17.2% to $740.1 billion, buoyed by optimism about its future growth prospects. Morgan Stanley named Tesla the most valuable automaker its \"top pick\" in the U.S. automotive industry, replacing Ford and predicted that Tesla's energy business could eventually surpass its auto business in value.\n\n(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Sell Before You Regret It",
        "content": "Things are getting difficult for technology stocks. The rotation of investor capital out of the mega-cap tech names that led the market rally in the year\u2019s first half is accelerating. Now, disappointing earnings reports from several high-profile technology concerns are exacerbating the selloff, highlighting tech stocks to sell.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just released its second-quarter print and the company\u2019s stock immediately fell 7%. Microsoft\u2019s stock plunged despite the fact that the company\u2019s results beat Wall Street forecasts for both sales and profits. Microsoft missed estimates for revenue in its cloud computing unit. As a result, the stock went down, dragging the Nasdaq Composite index lower with it.\n\nThe situation illustrates the shifting sentiment towards tech stocks and also shows that investors are not forgiving when it comes to the current earnings season. Here are three tech stocks to sell before you regret it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe only thing Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) second-quarter financial results made clear is that things are getting worse at the electric vehicle maker. The company had a disastrous Q2 print, announcing EPS of 52 cents versus 62 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue of $25.50 billion was slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $24.77 billion. However, total sales were up only 2% from a year earlier.\n\nWorse, Tesla reported that its revenue generated from electric vehicle sales declined 7% year-over-year to $19.90 billion. Tesla\u2019s profit margin fell to 14.4% from 18.7% in the second quarter of 2023. The bottom line is that Tesla continues to struggle with declining sales and rising competition, especially in China. As a result, the company has to continue dropping prices and offering discounts on its vehicles, hurting profit margins.\n\nTSLA stock fell 18% in the last 12 months.\n\nAT&T (T) A group of people all holding cellphones sit at a table in a circle.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) delivered a humdrum Q2 print that largely fell short of Wall Street estimates due to a continued erosion of its fiber-optic customers. The telecommunications giant reported EPS of 57 cents, which was inline with Wall Street forecasts. However, the profit was down 10% from a year earlier. Revenue totaled $29.80 billion, down 0.4% from a year earlier and slightly below estimates that called for sales of $29.98 billion.\n\nAT&T reported its second consecutive quarter of better-than-expected landline phone subscribers, but it continues to see a slump in its more lucrative fiber-optic internet business. The company said it added 239,000 broadband customers in Q2, which was below the 248,600 that analysts had anticipated. The company maintained its full-year guidance, calling for earnings of $2.15 to $2.25 per share and broadband revenue growth of 7%. T stock is trading 26% lower than where it was at five years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo.

The company, which now focuses on cybersecurity and the Internet of Things (IoT), reported that its net loss grew by nearly 300% as its sales evaporate. BlackBerry reported a first-quarter net loss of $42 million, which was 282% greater than a net loss of $11 million a year earlier. The latest results translated into a loss of 7 cents per share versus a loss of 2 cents the previous year.\n\nRevenue at BlackBerry totaled $144 million for what was its fiscal first quarter, down 61% from $373 million a year ago. The company is scrambling to cut costs as its financial situation rapidly deteriorates. Earlier this year, BlackBerry eliminated 200 jobs and closed six of its 36 global offices. It remains to be seen if the cost controls will have a positive impact. BlackBerry\u2019s share price is down 53% over the last 12 months and now trades as a penny stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "Inside Volkswagen\u2019s $130 billion EV battle",
        "content": "About 180 miles south of Berlin sits the small town of Zwickau, home to a sprawling Volkswagen factory\u2014and a perfect encapsulation of the past century\u2019s epic history. Generations of German autoworkers have built cars in the area, since the dawn of the combustion engine in the early 1900s, through the Nazi regime, the devastating Second World War, and decades of Cold War isolation from the West, when Zwickau\u2019s auto production was a prized Communist asset in the heart of East Germany.\n\nBut step inside the Zwickau factory now and the clanging noise of robots and steel car parts is the soundtrack of a new epic drama\u2014one that will define the $4\u00a0trillion global auto industry for decades to come: the EV revolution. Here in Volkswagen\u2019s first all-electric car factory, the company is live-testing the strategy for its long-term growth, in which EVs will become an ever bigger part of the world\u2019s auto market.\n\nThe question in this new battle is not whether Volkswagen can survive the world\u2019s steady shift from the combustion engine vehicles that it began making 87 years ago; its endurance seems assured. Last year it earned a whopping $348\u00a0billion in revenues and delivered 9.24\u00a0million vehicles.\n\nRather, the question is whether Volkswagen can successfully pull off a transition to electric vehicles quickly and efficiently enough, as the global EV market begins to lift off in earnest and competition for EV tech and raw materials heats up among China, the U.S., and Europe. The answer could determine whether the manufacturing giant emerges a winner in this new EV age, or whether it will be outwitted and outpaced by nimble newcomers. And as more Chinese electric cars surge into global auto markets, other legacy carmakers will likely face the same dilemma.\n\nAs Volkswagen is discovering, increasing one\u2019s odds in the contest is both complex and dizzyingly expensive, with no leeway for slow-footedness. It launched its EV strategy only in the mid-2010s, years after Tesla and China\u2019s BYD had sold their first electric cars.\n\nIn Zwickau, Volkswagen plowed more than $1.3\u00a0billion over the past five years into turning its combustion-engine factory into the company\u2019s first pure-EV production facility\u2014a top-to-bottom retrofit that it now regards as its blueprint for how to transform some of Volkswagen\u2019s other 120 plants globally. Despite the investment, Zwickau is falling short of expectations: Two years after the first EVs rolled off the assembly line, production figures are slipping, from 247,000 in 2023 to a projected 220,000 cars this year.\n\nEven so, Volkswagen is pushing ahead with plans to increase its EV output hugely in the coming years, no matter the expense, including aiming to sell 4\u00a0million EVs in China by 2030, and for more than half of cars it sells globally to be electric by then. A lack of action, it believes, could prove far more costly.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s EV plan revolves around creating and increasingly acquiring battery technology and platforms that can work across multiple models, leveraging its giant size.\n\n\u201cWe are very committed to our strategy,\u201d Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume tells Fortune. Proof of that, he says, is the roughly $130\u00a0billion the company has committed to a massive EV ramp-up over the next five years, of which Zwickau is a key element. For years, many insiders questioned the need for such a mammoth investment in electrification. But that internal debate is now settled, according to Blume. \u201cI think that electromobility is the prime technology of the future for the automotive industry,\u201d he notes, fresh from signing a $5\u00a0billion partnership with California electric carmaker Rivian to jointly develop next-generation EV software.\n\nThe question for Volkswagen is whether its deep pockets and huge scale of production can be harnessed in the transition, or whether its sheer size will slow it down. \u201cThere is an advantage to being big, and there is a detriment to being big,\u201d says Joe McCabe, president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, industry data analysts in Chester Springs, Pa. \u201cThe new producers can be like speedboats.\u201d\n\nThe last time Fortune visited Volkswagen\u2019s massive German auto plants, in early 2022, just that kind of \u201cspeedboat\u201d had roared up: Tesla. Elon Musk\u2019s spectacular growth in EV sales had turned Tesla into a leader in electric cars in both China and the U.S., virtually inventing the global EV market in little more than a decade. By 2022, Musk had his sights set on Europe, a market of 450\u00a0million people with long-held loyalty to indigenous brands like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes. Adding to Volkswagen\u2019s discomfort, Musk had broken ground on Tesla\u2019s first European gigafactory, a three-hour drive east of Volkswagen\u2019s iconic headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s factory had not yet opened at that time, its threat was already clear in Wolfsburg. Then\u2013CEO of Volkswagen Herbert Diess told Fortune at the time that the company\u2019s sluggish response to the EV revolution was the result of its vast size\u2014Volkswagen employs about 680,000 people across the world, more than half of them in Germany. Diess called it \u201can empire\u201d that had been lulled into feeling \u201crock-solid and unbeatable.\u201d\n\nToday that sense of invincibility has left Volkswagen, and so has Diess, whose exit in September 2022 came after tensions over his push to develop EV software from scratch. The resulting Cariad software division was plagued with glitches and delays, costing the company valuable time in rolling out electric models.\n\nBut even with new partnerships, Volkswagen, as well as Tesla, now confronts the threat from a far bigger \u201cempire\u201d: China. The rise of Chinese EVs has stunned lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe. Oliver Blume, chief executive officer of Volkswagen AG, at the Volkswagen AG media event in Beijing, China, on Wednesday, April 24, 2024. Volkswagen will start sales of a new electric-vehicle brand in China kitted out with gadgets like an in-car avatar to help win back young buyers it has lost to the likes of BYD Co. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe sales of Chinese electric vehicles are still relatively small in Europe, and are largely unavailable to American buyers owing to a mix of tariffs and restrictions on some critical minerals from China.\n\nBut it is not the sales figures themselves that are spooking Western governments and auto giants like Volkswagen. It is the speed at which those figures are increasing\u2014echoing for many Tesla\u2019s unexpected surge into the market 15 years ago. China\u2019s total car sales have accelerated at a mind-boggling pace, increasing more than fourfold this century, from about 6\u00a0million combustion-engine and electric vehicles in 2000 to about 26\u00a0million last year, compared with total car sales of 17\u00a0million in the U.S. and 13\u00a0million in Europe. About 14 million EVs were sold globally in 2023, of which 60% were in China, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nLast year, the Shenzhen producer BYD, China\u2019s largest EV company, overtook Tesla for the first time as the world\u2019s biggest electric-car seller, tripling its exports in just one year, in part by shipping thousands of vehicles to Europe, where it has opened sales rooms in Stockholm, Paris, and Berlin. While BYD\u2019s Europe business represents less than 1% of its global sales, that share could increase sharply once BYD\u2019s first European factory opens in Hungary next year. \u201cThe sales are still very low, but the quality is high, and they have a good pricing system,\u201d Jens Katzek, head of the Automotive Cluster East Germany, a regional industry group, says of Chinese EVs. Last year, China\u2019s EV producers sold 4.66\u00a0million vehicles globally versus Tesla\u2019s 1.81\u00a0million and Volkswagen\u2019s 770,000.\n\n\u201cThere is an advantage to being big, and there is a detriment to being big. The new producers can be like speedboats.\u201d\n\nJoe McCabe, CEO, AutoForecast Solutions\n\nWhen I arrived in Zwickau in late June, millions of Europeans were glued to their TVs, watching the European Championships\u2014a monthlong soccer extravaganza featuring 24 countries. Few fans would have missed seeing the premier car sponsor, BYD, whose three letters were splashed across the edge of the pitches. It was a striking change from previous tournaments, when Volkswagen had been the partner. The switch stung\u2014especially in Zwickau.\n\n\u201cIt was really on the minds of people,\u201d says Katzek. \u201cPeople realize suddenly, there\u2019s something from far away you\u2019d never heard about before.\u201d\n\nLike the U.S. government, the EU has scrambled to try to ward off the impact of Chinese EVs, and to protect a century of carmaking prowess. After a six-month probe, it announced in June that it would impose steep tariffs on Chinese EVs starting in October, including a 17% tariff on BYD cars, on top of existing 10% import duties, and a 38% tariff on SAIC\u2014the Shanghai carmaker with which Volkswagen formed its first Chinese joint venture when it arrived in China in 1984.\n\nThe Volkswagen group built a huge business for itself in China in the decades before those Chinese automakers took off. It has 39 auto plants in China, a workforce of more than 90,000, and an estimated 3,000 dealerships. \u201cThat\u2019s a big network,\u201d says Blume, who did his PhD studies in Shanghai. \u201cWe count on a strong relationship in the country.\u201d Chart shows vehicles sold in China and Europe, by manufacturers\n\nEven so, that relationship might not sustain sales as the country increasingly shifts to EVs. Last year, BYD overtook Volkswagen-branded cars as the top seller (of both fossil-fuel and electric cars) in China. The Chinese market is saturated with more than 100 EV companies that have slashed prices in a struggle to survive; more than 12 manufacturers shuttered production in 2023, according to a Chinese industry association. Added to that are a raft of incentives for consumers to buy Chinese-made EVs rather than fossil-fuel cars, including quicker delivery times and cheaper registration fees.\n\nMore and more, the EV factories that do survive, like BYD and its smaller competitors Nio and XPeng, produce high-end cars with state-of-the-art technology\u2014often outshining old Western partners like Volkswagen.\n\nThat much was clear at the Beijing Auto Show in April, where 900 exhibitions drew large crowds. \u201cThe non-Chinese stands had no interest from the public or the press,\u201d recalls Felipe Mu\u00f1oz, senior global analyst for JATO Dynamics, an automotive consulting firm. \u201cThe Western carmakers were looking at how [Chinese rivals] had become so powerful so fast, and wondering what to do and why did they let this happen.\u201d\n\nThe answer to that is complex, including perhaps that Western auto giants believed they were \u201cunbeatable\u201d empires, in the words of Diess. \u201cThey should have foreseen the rapid evolution of EVs in China,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz, who argues that one problem was crafting strategy in Europe, remote from the rapid changes. \u201cThey were the leaders, and when all these shifts came, they were not ready,\u201d he says.\n\nTwo years after the first electric cars rolled off the Zwickau assembly line, Volkswagen execs and autoworkers describe the factory\u2019s rapid transformation as the result of their finely tuned precision planning. The production floor had made VW\u00a0Golf cars for decades. Volkswagen gutted it, installing its modular electric toolkit chassis, which was built in-house and fits dozens of different car models within the group. At full capacity, the Zwickau facility can build 360,000 cars a year\u2014about one every minute\u2014turning out three Volkswagen and two Audi models, and one SEAT hatchback.\n\nYet Zwickau\u2019s operations are far from full capacity. EV orders hover around 240,000 a year and have sunk with high inflation rates and the arrival in Europe of cheaper Chinese EVs. Worse, last December the German government halted its generous tax breaks on new EVs almost overnight, owing to the country\u2019s budget crisis\u2014a move recounted angrily in almost every conversation I had in Zwickau. Orders dropped almost immediately.\n\nIn half-year results in July, the company forecasted that profits on sales could fall 1% this year over last, and said it may shut its Brussels plant that produces Audi EVs, which would mark its first factory closure in 36 years. Globally, Volkswagen delivered more than 2.24\u00a0million vehicles in the second quarter\u2014down 3.8% from the same period in 2023. Chart shows annual global electric car sales\n\nLast year, Zwickau cut one of its three eight-hour production shifts and laid off some workers on temporary contracts. \u201cA couple of years ago we were the lighthouse of the industry,\u201d says Marc Stephan, vice president of production in Zwickau, who spent four years at Volkswagen\u2019s Chattanooga plant before transferring to the EV factory in 2022. \u201cNow we are more like the seismograph of the industry.\u201d\n\nThat is the pessimistic outlook, however\u2014one that is not universally shared. McCabe, of AutoForecast Solutions, believes the company will ultimately emerge as an industry front-runner\u2014and possibly the winner\u2014since its mix of EVs and combustion-engine vehicles allows it to hedge one segment against the other, giving it a more dependable future than Tesla or BYD.\n\nVolkswagen is also ramping up its EV technology\u2014as evidenced by its Rivian investment\u2014and its electrification efforts. Two years ago Volkswagen split off its battery operation as a subsidiary called PowerCo. The new unit in July signed a $130\u00a0million deal with San Jose\u2013based QuantumScape to license next-generation solid-state EV batteries that retain 95% power for 300,000 miles. Volkswagen also adapted its 50-year-old combustion-engine plant in the west German town of Salzgitter to produce EV batteries, capable of powering about 4\u00a0million EVs a year.\n\n\u201c[Volkswagen] already [has] the sales channels and a significant footprint in the BEV space,\u201d McCabe says, referring to battery-powered EVs. Based on his company\u2019s data, he says, \u201cif we fast-forward to 2028, we have Volkswagen taking a leadership position globally in BEVs.\u201d\n\nBlume hopes that prediction is correct. The strategy has shifted since he took over as CEO two years ago, from the nearly century-old auto giant steadily becoming an all-electric company to continuing to offer hundreds of options, including many fossil-fuel cars. That breadth of options is especially important in the U.S., where only about 8% of new-car sales are pure electric. \u201cIt is about \u2026 being flexible,\u201d he says.\n\nFew are as deeply familiar with evolution as the autoworkers of Zwickau, generations of whom have worked in car plants through wars and Communist isolation. The EV race is just the latest global transformation.\n\nThis article appears in the August/September 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \"Inside Volkswagen's EV comeback.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Thinks This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Can Soar by 1,082%. Here's Why I Think It Could Run Even Higher Than That.",
        "content": "2024 has been a tumultuous year for Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) investors.\n\nFor the first six months of the year, its shares drastically underperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite as the stock cratered by roughly 20%. Nevertheless, longtime Tesla bull Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently revised her price target for the EV stock. Wood is calling for Tesla shares to reach $2,600 by 2029 -- 1,082% higher than its recent level.\n\nWhile some investors may argue such a forecast is outlandish, I personally think Wood may be underestimating Tesla's prospects.\n\nWood's thesis hinges on robotaxis, but...\n\nTesla is a pioneer among electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. After making considerable headway over the last several years, the company is now laser-focused on what it expects will be its next chapter -- autonomous driving technology.\n\nCEO Elon Musk is so compelled by the potential of autonomous driving that during the company's latest earnings call, he said: \"I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. If you believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock.\"\n\nThat's a polarizing statement, but those are pretty much par for the course with Musk. However, he isn't the only one with a strong conviction that autonomous driving is an enormous opportunity.\n\nIn Wood's latest model, she is projecting that subscriptions to Tesla's autonomous driving software -- dubbed full-self driving (FSD) -- will be the major catalyst for the company's future growth. In essence, FSD represents a source of high-margin recurring revenue for its EV operation.\n\nMoreover, if the company ends up as the superior developer of self-driving technology, Tesla will have an enormous opportunity to disrupt areas such as rental car businesses, delivery services, and ride-hailing applications.\n\nBut while I understand the opportunities FSD presents, I think Wood is underestimating Tesla's long-run potential. Image Source: Getty Images\n\n...what about robotics and energy storage?\n\nAutonomous driving is merely an extension of the EV business. But on a deeper level, FSD is an advanced application of artificial intelligence (AI). While Musk and his team remain steadfast in its FSD pursuits, Tesla has far more ambitions in the broader AI realm. In particular, it is developing a line of humanoid robots called Optimus. The idea is that it could enhance its efficiency and productivity by augmenting its human workforce with Optimus robots.\n\nShould this effort prove successful, Tesla would have an incredibly lucrative opportunity to commercialize Optimus and sell robots to other companies. This could revolutionize the labor market -- and Wood does not seem to be accounting for that potential in her model.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main reason why Wood isn't banking much on Optimus at the moment is that she believes commercialization of the robots is more than five years away. However, at the risk of being overly Pollyanna-ish, I think Wood may want to rethink that position. On Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk said \"we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories.\" He further predicted that in 2026 the company would be \"ramping up production quite a bit\" and selling them to external customers.\n\nBeyond its AI initiatives, Tesla has already built a thriving energy storage business that I think is criminally underappreciated.\n\nThe table below breaks down the financial results for Tesla's energy generation and storage segment over the last several quarters.\n\nCategory Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Energy generation and storage revenue $1.5 billion $1.6 billion $1.4 billion $1.6 billion $3.0 billion Energy generation and storage gross margin 18% 24% 22% 25% 25%\n\nData source: Tesla.\n\nTesla has doubled its revenues from the energy storage business over the last year. But even more impressive, it has achieved strong unit economics, underpinned by a consistently expanding gross margin profile.\n\nThese dynamics are important because the growth in the energy storage segment is helping offset the stagnation and decline of its core EV business. Moreover, because it's generating strong and growing profits from its energy generation unit, Tesla is still able to invest in important growth initiatives -- particularly in AI.\n\nLooking at Tesla's valuation\n\nOne thing that Wall Street analysts can't seem to agree on is Tesla's valuation. And on the surface, I totally get it. Its market capitalization is currently around $700 billion -- nearly 16 times that of Ford and 14 times the size of General Motors. Fundamentally, that doesn't really check out.\n\nHowever, like Wood and Musk, I see Tesla as much more than a car company. Investors need to look at the different components of its overall operation and analyze their valuations individually. This is commonly referred to as a sum-of-the-parts valuation.\n\nBeyond its EV segment, the company is making inroads in two areas with strong secular tailwinds: AI and sustainable energy. Admittedly, it has yet to really monetize its AI products at scale. For that reason, I understand if bearish investors remain skeptical. But as a Tesla shareholder for many years, I have a strong belief that the company will continue making progress toward FSD. Moreover, I think success in FSD will lead to a surge of demand as the company attempts to differentiate its fleet from the competition.\n\nIn addition, I'm compelled by the case around Optimus and am aligned with Musk on the premise that these robots will be commercialized sooner rather than later. Lastly, the energy storage business is growing faster than any other part of the company, and I don't see demand in that area slowing down anytime soon.\n\nWhether or not the stock reaches Wood's price target on her forecast schedule is moot. In the long run, Tesla has a lot of opportunities to disrupt several more markets other than EVs, and I am bullish about its prospects for executing on its vision. For these reasons, I think Tesla is a strong buy for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Rivian Tops Tesla -- and Everyone Else -- in 1 Important Score",
        "content": "At long last, there's a chink in Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) armor. The electric vehicle maker finally slipped from the top in a recent J.D. Power satisfaction survey.\n\nFor many years, Tesla vehicles dominated multiple satisfaction surveys, but as the vehicles age without significant refreshes, it was inevitable that newer EVs would outscore it. Here's a look at which brands are thriving -\u2013 hint: Rivian(NASDAQ: RIVN) shined -- and why it matters for investors.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nLet's briefly cover what the survey is and what it does. The J.D. Power U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout Study (APEAL) measures the experiences that vehicles offer through design, performance, safety, usability, comfort, perceived quality, and more, through 90 days of ownership.\n\nOne of the major takeaways from the recent data was that Tesla has slipped in the rankings after a streak of dominance. More specifically, non-Tesla battery electric vehicles (BEVs) scored 877 on a 1,000-point scale compared to Tesla's 870, and also higher than gasoline or plug-in hybrids at 842 and 841, respectively.\n\nIn a press release, Frank Hanley, senior director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power, said:\n\nTraditional manufacturers have listened to the Voice of the Customer. They're launching enhanced vehicles that are more in line with what customers want, including improved interior storage and higher quality materials, as well as ensuring features have ease of use. For BEVs, recent launches from traditional manufacturers have surpassed perennial leader Tesla when it comes to owners' level of emotional attachment and excitement with their new vehicle.\n\nAlthough Tesla has long dominated, it's also true that the age of its vehicles is starting to show in these surveys. In 2020, Tesla scored 896, followed by 893 and 887 in the years 2021 and 2022, respectively. It dropped even further in 2023 with a score of 878.\n\nThe highest score, and the only brand to register 900, was for Rivian. Although J.D. Power posted the scores for Tesla, Rivian, and Polestar, those brands are not included in its official rankings because the companies wouldn't comply with its rules on access to owner information.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nThis is huge news for Rivian for a couple of reasons.\n\nIn the automotive industry, it's expensive to woo customers from other brands, and carmakers that can keep customers loyal to their brand are in position to grow long-term revenue. If customers choose to stick with the Rivian brand for their next purchase, that could mean the R2 model, which launches in the first half of 2026,\u00a0or even the R3X, which is expected to come next (before the base R3).\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is also good news for the EV maker because it needs to generate stable demand (if not increase it) up until the R2 launch. Rivian delivered nearly 13,800 EVs during the second quarter, which topped estimates calling for 12,000 but was flat compared to the first quarter. However, the fact that consumers still appear to be extremely satisfied with Rivian's first-generation vehicles is a good sign.\n\nIt's also important for investors to see the impact of aging vehicle designs, as we're seeing with Tesla data. Rivian refreshed its R1 vehicles early in June. The R1S and R1T were reengineered through hundreds of hardware improvements, performance upgrades, and updated in-house drive systems.\n\nThe company also unveiled two entirely new premium trim packages, which generally bring in higher margins, as well as options for a new exterior Storm Blue paint color and blackout trim.\n\nRivian needs the refreshed vehicles to continue performing well with consumers and critics alike, to help bridge the gap between now and the launch of its R2. If these surveys are any indication, the future still looks bright for this\u00a0startup EV maker.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "IS Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) the Best AI Stock to Buy on the Dip?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks.Since Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nGene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that the key reason behind the latest decline in tech stocks was major companies projecting high CapEx and giving no updates on AI monetization. Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending \u201ccannot slow down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you\u2019re gonna boil it down to one point, it\u2019s gonna be higher for longer and it\u2019s good for AI.\u201d\n\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\n\u201cIf you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.\u201d\n\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a \u201cspectacular bubble burst.\u201d\n\nFor this article we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Famous Analyst Say You Should Buy the Dip on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) AI Stock?\n\nHadrian / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nGene Munster continues to be bullish on Tesla.\n\nAmid a decline in EV sales growth, Elon Musk\u2019s only option is to go all-in on AI. After a Twitter poll that overwhelmingly voted in favor of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) investing capital in xAI, Musks\u2019 AI company, the CEO of Tesla said he\u2019d discuss investing $5 billion in xAI with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nElon Musk said in a latest earnings call with analysts that massive discounts from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitors created headwinds for the company in the most recently reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also delayed its robotaxi event until October. All possible catalysts for Tesla stock lie far into the future and the reality is revealing itself to Elon Musk who admitted during the\u00a0latest earnings call that he\u2019s been overly optimistic about robo taxis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that \u2014 to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.\u201d\n\nDuring the second quarter, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0automotive gross margin fell to 18.47% from 19.22% the previous year. Non-automotive revenue, now 22% of total sales compared to 14.67% in Q2 2023, has a lower gross margin, negatively impacting overall profitability. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0\u00a0is still heavily reliant on EVs where demand is falling. Tesla energy business is not strong enough to offset declines in the core business.\n\nBaron Partners Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the Fund\u2019s underperformance this quarter stemmed from the Fund\u2019s 10-year investment in\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla\u2019s shares fell 29.3% during the period and detracted 13.41% from the Fund\u2019s first quarter results. Although Tesla has contributed importantly to the Fund\u2019s performance since 2014, on occasion it has detracted from quarterly performance. In previous instances when Tesla shares have underperformed during a discrete period, they have shortly afterwards reflected the strong growth of the underlying business and the stock has appreciated considerably. We believe that will be the case again, although cannot guarantee it.\n\nA significant decline also occurred at the end of 2022. In that instance, investors had become concerned about a host of external factors. Investors believed the company founder, visionary, and CEO Elon Musk was distracted by his acquisition of Twitter. They also believed a weak Chinese economy emerging from COVID and U.S. government policies would curtail the purchases of Tesla vehicles. These fears proved to be overblown. As the company achieved milestones in the succeeding year, the stock subsequently doubled over the next 12 months\n\nOverall, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.0% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues.\"\n\nBreaking Down the Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nFor the 285 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 54.3% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +9.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues, with 80.7% beating EPS estimates and 59.6% beating revenue estimates. Except for the revenue beats percentage, which at 59.6% is near the lowest for this group of 285 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periods. Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.0% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the first quarter of 2022. Q2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +27.6% from the same period last year on +13.9% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +5.1% (from +9.0%).\n\nMicrosoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks, with the market unimpressed with either of the reports. This contrasted with the companies\u2019 Q1 releases when Alphabet and Tesla were up big on the quarterly results while Microsoft was only modestly down.\n\nThere is no surprise in the Tesla sell-off, as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the near-term outlook. The EV maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market, prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins. As a result, Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues. Given Tesla shares\u2019 gain of more than +40% in the three-month period ahead of the quarterly release, the post-release sell-off makes perfect sense.\n\nThe sell-off in Alphabet and Microsoft shares is far more challenging to understand, as both of the Tech giants handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of their businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe issue in the Alphabet report appears to be the market\u2019s disappointment with a bigger-than-expected capital spending level of $13.2 billion in the period relative to expectations of $12.2 billion. Management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the AI rollout than the alternative, which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend compared to what investors had been factoring in.\n\nThe issue with Microsoft appears to be the seeming deceleration in the company\u2019s Azure unit. However, management explicitly stated that demand remained strong and that it\u2019s faced challenges in meeting the demand due to capacity issues.\n\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, or any other Tech operator as a negative, but this appears to be the case with Tech investors at this stage. Perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the AI-centric investments in which Alphabet, Microsoft, and its peers are currently engaged in.\n\nThis also means that capex spending levels in the coming Meta and Amazon reports will similarly receive close scrutiny.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +27.6% on +13.9% higher revenues.\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +17.9% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.4%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\n\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.1%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "Note: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019s Earnings Trends\u00a0report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nFor the 285 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 54.3% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +9.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues, with 80.7% beating EPS estimates and 59.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nExcept for the revenue beats percentage, which at 59.6% is near the lowest for this group of 285 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periods.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.0% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +27.6% from the same period last year on +13.9% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +5.1% (from +9.0%).\n\nMicrosoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG, and Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks, with the market unimpressed with either of the reports. This contrasted with the companies\u2019 Q1 releases when Alphabet and Tesla were up big on the quarterly results while Microsoft was only modestly down.\n\nThere is no surprise in the Tesla sell-off, as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the near-term outlook. The EV maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market, prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins. As a result, Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues. Given Tesla shares\u2019 gain of more than +40% in the three-month period ahead of the quarterly release, the post-release sell-off makes perfect sense.\n\nThe sell-off in Alphabet and Microsoft shares is far more challenging to understand, as both of the Tech giants handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of their businesses.\n\nThe issue in the Alphabet report appears to be the market\u2019s disappointment with a bigger-than-expected capital spending level of $13.2 billion in the period relative to expectations of $12.2 billion. Management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the AI rollout than the alternative, which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend compared to what investors had been factoring in.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe issue with Microsoft appears to be the seeming deceleration in the company\u2019s Azure unit. However, management explicitly stated that demand remained strong and that it\u2019s faced challenges in meeting the demand due to capacity issues.\n\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, or any other Tech operator as a negative, but this appears to be the case with Tech investors at this stage. Perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the AI-centric investments in which Alphabet, Microsoft, and its peers are currently engaged in.\n\nThis also means that capex spending levels in the coming Meta and Amazon reports will similarly receive close scrutiny.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +27.6% on +13.9% higher revenues, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +17.9% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.4%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. The chart below shows how the aggregate earnings total for the Tech sector has evolved over the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.1%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our new archenemy, the famous Elon Musk,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cDo you want to fight? Let\u2019s do it. Elon Musk, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m not afraid of you, Elon Musk. Let\u2019s fight, wherever you want.\u201d\n\nMaduro\u2019s comments quickly went viral, with several X accounts tagging Musk in the clip and asking if he would rise to Maduro\u2019s challenge. In response to one of the tweets, Musk replied, \u201cI accept.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire later added that Maduro would \u201cchicken out\u201d of the fight.\n\nMusk drew Maduro\u2019s ire after condemning his re-election results, accusing him of \u201cmajor election fraud,\u201d and labeling him a \u201cdictator\u201d on X.\n\nMaduro secured 51% of the vote in Venezuela\u2019s elections, according to the National Electoral Council. Opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez received 44% of the votes, the council said, though pre-election polls showed him leading by a wide-margin. The results have been disputed by the opposition, which has called on the military to intervene.\n\nMusk has previously accepted high-profile fights. He became ambivalent abouta cage match with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg after weeks of flirting with the idea. Musk claimed he had to call off the fight last summer because he needed back surgery, but he has recently said he would fight Zuckerberg \u201c anyplace, anytime, any rules.\u201d\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 U.S. road safety investigators say they will look into an April crash near Seattle after authorities determined that a Tesla was operating on the company's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system when it hit and killed a motorcyclist.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it is gathering information on the crash from law enforcement officers and Tesla.\n\nInvestigators from the Washington State Patrol determined that the system was in use after downloading information from the event-data recorder on the 2022 Tesla Model S involved in the crash, agency spokesman Capt. Deion Glover said Tuesday.\n\nNo charges have been filed against the driver but the investigation is still under way, Glover said.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d should be able to run without human supervision by the end of this year. He has been promising a fleet of robotaxis for several years. During the company\u2019s earnings conference call, he acknowledged that his predictions on the issue \u201chave been overly optimistic in the past.\u201d\n\nMusk is staking much of Tesla's future on development of self-driving software and a humanoid robot. He has told investors that Tesla should be seen as a robotics and artificial intelligence company, and he has scheduled an event in October to reveal a new robotaxi.\n\nTesla did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nTesla has two partially automated driving systems, \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d which can take on many driving tasks even on city streets, and Autopilot, which can keep a car in its lane and away from objects in front of it. Sometimes the names are confused by Tesla owners and the public.\n\nTesla says at present neither system can drive itself and that human drivers must be ready to take control at any time.\n\n\u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d is being tested on public roads by selected Tesla owners.\n\nTwice NHTSA has made Tesla recall \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d because it disobeyed traffic laws. It also forced a recall of Autopilot, alleging that Tesla's system for making sure drivers pay attention was inadequate. In April, the agency began investigating whether the Autopilot recall actually worked.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- On a recent summer night in central China, a couple on a motorcycle swerved in front of a driverless cab, forcing the vehicle to brake rapidly. At an intersection, it hesitantly performed a three-point turn, careful to avoid a man with a bike gawking at the new technology from the roadside.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump\u2019s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Herm\u00e8s Fortune Has Vanished Iran\u2019s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says\n\nWelcome to Wuhan, the city of 14 million people that\u2019s shaking off its Covid-19 stigma to position itself at the vanguard of smart-car technology \u2014 and the difficult questions it raises about the impact artificial intelligence could have on jobs in China and around the world.\n\nMore than 500 electric robotaxis built by Baidu Inc. currently ply the city\u2019s streets, with plans for an additional 1,000 to be deployed by year-end. The expansion positions Baidu and other Chinese firms as competitors with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo and out in front of Tesla Inc., which has delayed its highly anticipated unveiling of robotaxi prototypes by about two months to October.\n\nMoving fast to develop driverless taxis fits into President Xi Jinping\u2019s playbook to bolster the economy by making high-tech industries the centerpiece of China\u2019s economic future, transitioning away from a dependence on property and lower-value exports. The nation is already home to the world\u2019s two biggest electric-vehicle battery manufacturers and dominates the EV supply chain, a result of state subsidies and cutthroat competition that\u2019s made constant innovation a must.\n\nYet, as Wuhan is discovering, running ahead of the curve can also have its drawbacks.\n\nAlready, residents are complaining that Baidu\u2019s robotaxis, deployed under the Apollo Go brand in English, are causing traffic jams, partly because they\u2019re seen as driving too cautiously. Riffing off a phrase that sounds similar to the taxi\u2019s name in Chinese, Wuhan residents have christened the cabs \u201csilly radishes\u201d because they move at slower speeds and don\u2019t always respond to situations on the road the same way a human would.\n\nAnd even though Wuhan\u2019s robotaxi fleet represents just a fraction of the total cab population \u2014 which employs an estimated 24,000 drivers, according to Shanghai-based outlet The Paper \u2014 there\u2019s growing anxiety over the economic implications of the city embracing driverless technology. That\u2019s especially true in the ride-hailing industry, where some drivers are already reluctant gig workers who lost their jobs in other sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe government needs to balance jobs and tech,\u201d said one Wuhan resident, who asked that he be identified by his family name, Wang. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t only focus on wanting Wuhan to be a technologically developed city but also take care of the people who are still drivers.\u201d\n\nEconomists echo those concerns.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to witness robotaxis become reality, yet it\u2019s not clear how taxi drivers will face the challenge, and how the government will strike a balance between technological breakthroughs and weak labor market conditions,\u201d Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote in a recent note.\n\nBaidu is encouraging people to try its service by heavily discounting fares. A recent 30-minute daytime journey covering almost 10 kilometers (6 miles) cost about 14 yuan ($1.93) after a company discount of almost 26 yuan. That\u2019s roughly one-third the cost of a comparable ride in a premium-class, human-driven taxi with the ride-hailing service Didi.\n\nThat pricing gap has frustrated some taxi companies, who say the experiment already has gone too far.\n\n\u201cThe original intent of technology is to make human life better, but the reality is that it makes the lower class hungry,\u201d according to a statement signed by Wuhan Jianshe Automotive Passenger Transportation Co., which called for more restrictions on where the driverless cabs are allowed to operate.\n\nThe pricing scheme also makes the current strategy commercially unviable, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Alex Yao wrote in a report last month, citing \u201cdiscouragingly deep loss-making financials.\u201d\n\nWuhan government officials didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment about the risk to jobs that robotaxis pose or expansion plans for driverless car services in the city. Representatives for Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go business declined to comment on the potential impact on jobs from robotaxis.\n\nWuhan became China\u2019s biggest proving ground for Baidu\u2019s taxis partly because authorities there have taken a more relaxed regulatory approach relative to other regions and cities. There are also some practical advantages.\n\nThe city\u2019s geographic layout \u2014 it\u2019s composed of three distinct areas separated by rivers spanned by suspension bridges \u2014 and a driving culture known for not following the rules of the road make it a complex and demanding testing ground.\n\nBloomberg News put the Baidu service to the test last month, hailing one of the taxis via an app. Entering the vehicle, we found a transparent divider separating the passenger area from the unoccupied driver\u2019s seat. At one point, the car accelerated to a top speed of 50 kilometers per hour, though it was more typically traversing the busy streets at around 20 kph.\n\nThe sight of a steering wheel moving on its own was a little unsettling. The in-car entertainment system was reminiscent of those available on a long-haul business-class flight, though the music selection was eclectic. At one point, our little robotaxi was cruising along the streets of Wuhan to the thumping electro house sounds of \u201cFast Cars and Superstars\u201d by Cristian Marchi.\n\nEric Hu, a 43-year-old insurance industry worker based in Shanghai, took advantage of a recent work trip to Wuhan to test out a robotaxi. Although similar services are available in Shanghai, he said they tend to be located in distant suburbs and are less useful to people working downtown.\n\nHu deemed his experience in Wuhan \u201cgood\u201d and said that he\u2019d become a regular user of driverless cars \u2014 if fares remain low. He also expressed concern about the social impact of the technology.\n\n\u201cIf all taxi drivers lose their jobs, then that\u2019s something that governments have to be worried about,\u201d he said.\n\nBaidu founder Robin Li said during the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call that, as of April 19, its driverless services had provided over 6 million rides across the country. The proportion of \u201cfully unmanned driving\u201d trips \u2014 the company also offers cars where a human sits in the driver\u2019s seat but doesn\u2019t touch the steering wheel unless needed \u2014 exceeded 55% and is expected to reach 100% over the next few quarters, he said.\n\nChina didn\u2019t get the first jump on driverless cars. Companies including Waymo and General Motors Co.\u2019s Cruise have been honing driverless-vehicle technology for years in San Francisco and other US cities.\n\nBut scaling robotaxi services has proven challenging. Cruise was halted last year when one of its cars hit and dragged a pedestrian who had already been hit by a separate vehicle. Companies in the space have also faced public backlash, including acts of vandalism.\n\nThe US hasn\u2019t set hard rules or qualifications for companies deploying automated-driving technology, electing instead to publish voluntary guidelines. Washington\u2019s approach contrasts with China\u2019s in that Beijing has made driverless-car development a strategic priority.\n\nStill, the US\u2019s early start means China has some catching up to do, according to Kevin Xu, a US-based technology investor and founder of Interconnected Capital.\n\n\u201cTop Chinese self-driving companies like Baidu and Pony are making great progress, but by no means are they leading their US counterparts,\u201d Xu said, referring to Pony.ai, a startup that\u2019s partnered with Japan\u2019s Toyota Motor Corp. \u201cThat being said, China does have a somewhat more friendly or receptive regulatory environment toward self-driving cars.\u201d\n\nIn one of the latest indications of China\u2019s welcoming approach, authorities in Hengqin, an island in the south, ruled this week that autonomous vehicles can now be tested on any public road, allowing self-driving cars to interact with a much wider range of traffic conditions.\n\nTesla is one potential competitor that, in theory, could have an advantage over Chinese firms. But so far, it appears to be on the back foot.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock climbed early this year on optimism about Elon Musk\u2019s planned robotaxi unveiling, seeing it as a potential sign that the company will make good on his years of predictions about self-driving Teslas. But the August event was pushed to October, and some analysts have warned that investors\u2019 high expectations could be misplaced.\n\nSeparately, Musk reached a deal earlier this year with Baidu for the Chinese company to provide high-precision mapping and navigation services to support Tesla deploying its advanced driver-assistance system in China.\n\nSo far, the Baidu service in Wuhan remains very much in a testing phase.

And while the service is billed as operating around the clock, Bloomberg noted restrictions on using the app in at least two distinct parts of the city.\n\nAn Apollo Go spokesperson said the company adjusts where its Wuhan fleet travels \u201cin response to rider demand and a range of other relevant factors.\u201d\n\nThat limited reach may be helping contain public alarm.\n\n\u201cThe recent hype on social media has given robocars more exposure to potential consumers, but it is still too early to say how the industry will evolve,\u201d said Jing Yang, director of China corporate research at Fitch Ratings.\n\nSome Wuhan drivers who spoke with Bloomberg signaled they aren\u2019t worried about the driverless taxis, at least not at their current levels of deployment. Others speculate that beyond short-distance trips, passengers might not be ready to ride at higher speeds without seeing someone able to take control of the steering wheel in an emergency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a robot,\u201d said Feng Zhengming, a 42-year-old driver at rival taxi company Didi. \u201cIt\u2019s not as flexible as human beings.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA \u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools The Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "S&P 500, the U.S. stock market benchmark index, has been undergoing a correction phase recently, accompanied by several stock downgrades. According to Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the stock market is expected to face an additional 2% downside risk based on the current technical levels and market conditions.\n\nThe S&P 500 is hovering around its 50-day moving average. Still, the pace of the recent sell-off suggests that a test of its 100-day moving average is likely, which could result in approximately another 2% near-term downside. Despite this, Wells Fargo analysts have maintained their price target for the S&P 500 at 5535, representing a slight 2% upside from the present levels.\n\nThey caution investors that this projected increase is not substantial enough to justify new investments. The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting could act as a positive catalyst for the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cWe retain our view that the Fed cuts once this year in December and are less concerned about risks of a sharper slowdown in the economy. That said, a September cut has moved closer to our baseline,\u201d Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economists said in a note.\n\nWells Fargo suggests that if the S&P 500 moves even lower before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision on July 31, it could offer an opportunity for some near-term gains.\n\nWall Street analysts adjust ratings on individual stocks as the market moves lower.\n\nHere are the three big stock downgrades that have recently hit the headlines.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wall\n\nSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemonAthletica (NASDAQ:LULU) specializes in high-quality athletic apparel and accessories. Known for its strong brand loyalty and innovative products, it attracts investors seeking growth in the booming athleisure market.\n\nCiti (NYSE:C) downgraded Lululemon stock from Buy to Neutral and significantly reduced its price target from $415 to $300. The revision follows observations of a slowdown in the active apparel sector, impacting the company\u2019s performance.\n\nThe downgrade is based on recent credit card data indicating a slower second quarter than the first, which already showed a notable decline from fiscal year 2023. The analyst cited several concerns, including Lululemon\u2019s execution issues, such as a lackluster product assortment and limited color and sizing options.\n\nThese issues may leave the retailer more vulnerable to increased competition and promotional pressures in the second half of 2024 and into the fiscal year 2025. The firm brokerage pointed out that the weakening trends and a tougher macroeconomic environment make a resurgence in U.S. market trends unlikely for Lululemon in the latter half of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leader in electric vehicle production and renewable energy solutions. Investors are drawn to its cutting-edge technology, visionary leadership and potential for long-term growth in the sustainable energy sector.\n\nHowever, multiple stock downgrades in recent days after a softer-than-expected earnings report hit the stock. Cantor Fitzgerald, New Street Research and Phillip Capital are some shops that moved Tesla stock lower on their rating scale.\n\nNew Street Research, for instance, cut its rating on Tesla, moving the electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s stock from a \u201cBuy\u201d to a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating. The firm set a price target for Tesla shares at $225.00.\n\nThe current New Street Research assessment suggests that while Tesla\u2019s long-term outlook remains positive, with expectations for auto margins to recover and energy contributing to growth, there are limited near-term catalysts to drive the stock price higher.\n\nMoreover, the tech-focused brokerage firm notes that demand challenges potentially hinder price stabilization and volume growth. This is not expected to pick up until the latter half of the following year.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors Company is a multinational automotive manufacturing company. GM stock\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global automaker known for its extensive vehicle range. Investors are interested in GM\u2019s strategic pivot to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology.\n\nThe company delivered impressive second-quarter results for 2024, highlighting substantial financial growth and improved operational efficiency. The automaker recorded a revenue of $47.9 billion, exceeding the anticipated targets for the quarter.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) adjusted its stance on General Motors, issuing one of the notable stock downgrades from Overweight to Equal-Weight and slightly raising the price target to $47 from $46. The revision follows a noteworthy jump in General Motors\u2019 share price, which has risen approximately 90% since November, marking the company as one of the most robust performers in the global auto manufacturing sector year-to-date.\n\nAccording to the investment firm, General Motors has shown commendable improvements in capital discipline, which the market has recognized. Morgan Stanley now sees a balanced risk-reward scenario for General Motors, with a bear case target adjusted upwards to $28 from $26 and a bull case target increased to $62 from $60.\n\nThe bank\u2019s decision to downgrade reflects a mix of factors that could pose challenges to General Motors, including anticipated industry headwinds such as price and mix normalization, potential increases in inventory and incentives, risks associated with the electric vehicle strategy and a projected decline in profits from the China market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Top 3 Lithium Stocks to Buy Now for High Growth Potential",
        "content": "Despite growing interest in the green energy revolution, lithium stocks faced challenges this year. Lithium is cruical for lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from electric vehicles to smartphones.\n\nYet, due to a supply glut and\u00a0slowing demand, its price dropped by over 65% in 2024. Consequently, many sector companies have experienced declines in share prices.\n\nNonetheless, the long-term outlook for lithium remains promising. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that demand could increase up to 40x by 2040 compared to 2020. This presents a unique opportunity for investors to find value in lithium stocks, particularly those with strong fundamentals and attractive valuations. Savvy investors may find compelling prospects in this essential sector as the market stabilizes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three lithium stocks poised to thrive amid rising demand for sustainable technologies.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nWe begin our discussion on lithium stocks with Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), a global leader in lithium production. In recent months, Albemarle saw a sharp revenue decline due to plummeting lithium prices, causing ALB stock to drop below its 2018 highs.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion, reflecting a 47% year-over-year decline, primarily from lower lithium pricing.\u00a0Net income also fell 47%, resulting in a loss of 8 cents per share, starkly contrasting earnings per share of $10.51 in the same quarter last year.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Albemarle\u2019s strong reserves, growth projects, and financial health offer a solid foundation for recovery. The company is focused on expanding production and improving operational efficiencies, achieving $90 million in productivity improvements in the first quarter alone. With key production plants in stable regions, Albemarle is positioned to navigate geopolitical tensions and supply chain challenges.\n\nAs a result, ALB stock declined 36% in 2024. Meanwhile, it offers a 1.8% dividend yield. Shares are trading at 36.3x forward earnings and 1.3x sales. Analysts project a potential 40% upside, with a 12-month median price target of $127.50.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT) is a top pick for investors seeking exposure to leading lithium stocks. This exchange-traded fund provides a diversified portfolio of companies across the entire lithium cycle, including mining, refining, battery production and EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLaunched in July 2010, LIT holds 40 stocks. The top 10 holdings comprise about 53% of its $1.2 billion net assets. Geographically, the ETF is well-balanced, with around 37% of its companies based in China, 24% in the U.S., 12% in Australia, 10% in South Korea, 10% in Japan.\n\nThe fund\u2019s industry allocation includes electrical equipment (39%), chemicals (25%), metals and mining (14%), automobiles (9%), and semiconductors (6%). Leading names in the portfolio are\u00a0 Albemarle, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK (OTCMKTS:TTDKY), Chinese EV seller BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and Australian resources company Mineral Resources (OTCMKTS:MALRY).\n\nIn 2024, LIT stock fell nearly 25%. Meanwhile, the fund offers a 1.6% dividend yield and comes with a 0.75% expense ratio. or $75 annually per $10,000 invested. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at 11.8x and 3.6x, respectively.\n\nDespite the setback in recent months, investing in LIT around these levels could be a solid choice for capitalizing on the growing demand for lithium.\n\nSigma Lithium (SGML) EV Battery Module for Automotive Industry on Production Line. Lithium-ion High-voltage Battery Component for Electric Vehicle or Hybrid Car. High Capacity Battery on Conveyor. Undervalued battery stocks\n\nSource: IM Imagery / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion on lithium stocks with Sigma Lithium (NASDAQ:SGML), a Canadian company producing lithium concentrate primarily for the EV battery market. Operating in Brazil\u2019s Lithium Valley, Sigma is a key player in the energy transition supply chain. It is known for its \u201cQuintuple Zero Green Lithium,\u201d which is a carbon neutral, socially and environmentally sustainable lithium concentrate.\n\nIn the first quarter, Sigma reported flat revenue of $37.4 million, reflecting a slight decline. However, net loss improved to $7 million, compared to a loss of $9.5 million in the previous quarter. Despite challenges, Sigma is now the world\u2019s second-lowest cost producer of lithium concentrate, giving it a competitive advantage.\n\nTo drive growth, Sigma plans to ramp up concentrate production through infrastructure development. This aims to double its annual capacity to 520,000 metric tons by 2025. Additionally, a recently secured $22.4 million deferred letter of credit with Banco do Brasil (OTCMKTS:BDORY) further strengthens Sigma\u2019s position, providing competitive vendor financing and enabling the company to expand its client base.\n\nSo far in 2024, SGML stock has declined 65%. Meanwhile, shares currently trade at 25.1x forward earnings and 7.3x trailing sales. Finally, analysts remain bullish with a 12-month median price target of $25 for Sigma Lithium, suggesting a 130% upside potential from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla car that killed Seattle motorcyclist was in 'Full Self-Driving' mode, police say",
        "content": "By Hyunjoo Jin\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A Tesla Model S car was in \"Full Self-Driving\" mode when it hit and killed a 28-year-old motorcyclist in the Seattle area in April, police said, making it at least the second fatal accident involving the technology on which Tesla CEO Elon Musk is pinning his hopes.\n\nThe 56-year-old driver was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide based on his admission that he was looking at his cell phone while using the driver assistant feature, police said in a statement.\n\nTesla says its \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\" software requires active driver supervision and does not make vehicles autonomous.\n\nPreviously, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said there was one fatal accident involving a Tesla vehicle using FSD software between August 2022 and August 2023.\n\nThe NHTSA said that it \"is aware of this crash and is gathering information from local law enforcement and Tesla.\"\n\nThe police said the case remains under investigation, but experts say there are limitations to Tesla's technology dependent on cameras and artificial intelligence. Tesla's rivals such as Alphabet's Waymo also uses expensive sensors like lidars to detect the driving environment.\n\n\"There are so many things that can go wrong\" with Tesla's camera-only system, said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. For instance, he said it can inaccurately measure how far away an object is.\n\n\"It is extremely challenging to collect and curate data from all sorts of real-world elements such as motorcycles and bicycles in the broad range of possible weather, lightning, road and traffic conditions,\" said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThis year, Musk shelved Tesla's all-new affordable cars and increased his bets on self-driving vehicles, saying he will be shocked if Tesla cannot achieve full self-driving capability next year.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley club last weekend, he said a future vehicle will be like a \"tiny mobile lounge\" where drivers will be able to watch movies, play video games, work and even drink and sleep.\n\nMusk has been aiming to achieve self-driving capability for several years, with the technology under growing regulatory and legal scrutiny.\n\nThe NHTSA began a probe of Autopilot in August 2021 after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles had hit stationary emergency vehicles, and reviewed hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn December 2023, Tesla was forced to recall nearly all its vehicles on U.S. roads to add safeguards to the software.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by David Gregorio and Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

Read them carefully before investing.\n\nPelosi, a Democratic congresswoman from California, disclosed buying $1 million to $5 million in Nvidia shares with the subject line stating that 10,000 shares were purchased. The trade was made on July 26. Pelosi's disclosed trades are made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist.\n\nThe filing also disclosed selling $1 million to $5 million in Microsoft shares, with the subject line stating that 5,000 shares were sold. The trade was made on July 26, several days before the technology company reported fourth-quarter financial results.\n\nPelosi previously disclosed buying 10,000 Nvidia shares valued at $1 million to $5 million in early July along with the sale of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares. The congresswoman and her husband also disclosed buying 50 call options of Nvidia back in November 2023 that have risen significantly in value since the filing.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires.

        "title": "Relief rally in Nvidia cannot hide likelihood stock has entered bear market territory after losing nearly $800 billion",
        "content": "Nvidia H100 chips are still the hottest commodity in the tech industry, but sadly the same cannot necessarily be said about its stock.\n\nShares in Jensen Huang\u2019s semiconductor company have plunged 20% since their all-time closing high on June 18th, usually considered to be the start of a bear market. Already roughly more than $780 billion have been wiped off its market cap, an amount equivalent to the entire value of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla or an Eli Lilly, the pharma group behind the GLP-1 weight loss drug Mounjaro.\n\nWhile the stock saw a relief rally, yo-yoing sharply higher on Wednesday, it only snapped back to last week\u2019s levels and the gains could prove short-lived as sentiment across the sector remains fragile.\n\nThe Futurum Group, an industry research and advisory firm for the tech industry, told the\u00a0Financial Times the weakness was likekly just a rotation out of sectors that performed well over the course of the year as opposed to anything related to its underlying fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen money flow out of Big Tech, mostly I think because they have had an incredible run-up,\u201d CEO Daniel Newman\u00a0said, \u201cand that of course gave room for a little bit of a sell-off.\u201d\n\nNvidia sells graphic processors best suited for training neural networks like transformers used in the development of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and other large language models. Its most advanced chips are so powerful the U.S. imposes export controls to ensure they do not fall into the hands of strategic rivals like China.\n\nConcerns have grown in recent weeks, however, that major cloud-computing providers\u2014including hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft and Google\u2014as well as other megacap companies investing heavily in AI, such as Meta and Tesla, may not see a sufficient return on their investments.\n\nMicrosoft predicted revenue growth in its Azure cloud business would\u00a0slow in the current first quarter from the 29% achieved in the three months through June, before accelerating in the second half of its fiscal year. Shares took a beating on Wednesday, heavily underperforming gains in the S&P 500 index.\n\n'Kicked to the curb'\n\nAnother major customer of Nvidia to disappoint recently was Tesla, which needs AI training chips to solve autonomous driving\u2014something CEO Elon Musk promised he would finally crack this year or next. (He'd previously promised Tesla cars could drive cross-country, on their own, by the end of 2017.) So far this year he\u2019s spent $1.6 billion to bulk up his computing cluster, which trains on images fed from cameras mounted on all Tesla cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn an investor call last week, Musk said the lack of constant and reliable supply of Nvidia H100 chips is forcing him to double down now on\u00a0Dojo, his own proprietary silicon optimized for vision-based machine learning. Musk has talked about renting out spare training compute to third parties, a \u201cDojo-as-a-service\u201d that Morgan Stanley estimates can be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. If successful, his custom silicon would pose a threat to Nvidia.\n\nEven after the drop, Nvidia has still more than doubled its value since the start of January. But it\u2019s a far cry from the heady days of this spring when it eclipsed Apple and Microsoft to become the largest company in the world, at one point worth over $3.3 trillion.\n\nThe weakness has also affected its Taiwan production partner, TSMC, the world\u2019s largest foundry for fabricating microchips outsourced by third parties like Nvidia. Its stock has lost roughly $200 billion over the past couple of weeks after breaking through the $1 trillion mark at one point. It, too, is experiencing a relief rally.\n\n\u201cNvidia stock has become a wasteland,\u201d said investor Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s because Nvidia doesn\u2019t benefit from rate cuts, so its stock gets kicked to the curb in this environment.\u201d\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nLater on Wednesday the Federal Reserve is\u00a0expected to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in September, its first since March 2020.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "BYD plant\n\nUber plans to deploy Chinese driverless cars on its service as part of a deal with BYD, the country\u2019s biggest electric vehicle manufacturer.\n\nBYD and Uber unveiled a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d on Wednesday under which Uber drivers will be offered preferential prices and financing rates to help them buy 100,000 of the Chinese company\u2019s cars.\n\nThe two businesses also said they would work together on BYD\u2019s autonomous cars being available on Uber in the future.\n\nThe tie-up will cover Uber\u2019s operations in the UK, where the business has vowed to achieve zero emissions by 2030.\n\nThe company has said it will be fully electric in London by the end of next year, the first city in the world where it has made the pledge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, it will not include the US, Uber\u2019s biggest market, where President Joe Biden recently announced 100pc tariffs on Chinese electric cars.\n\nBYD briefly surpassed Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest electric car manufacturer by volume at the end of last year, and its sales are forecast to surpass Elon Musk\u2019s company during 2024 as a whole.\n\nTesla has also been investing heavily in developing autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nDespite saying last year that fully driverless cars are \u201cbasically impossible\u201d, the company has recently sought tie-ups with AI microchip company Nvidia to develop the technology.\n\nUber already offers autonomous rides through Waymo, the driverless car company owned by Google\u2019s parent company, in Arizona.\n\nInitially, BYD and Uber said the deal would accelerate electric car sales by offering discounts on vehicles, as well as financing, charging and maintenance.\n\nUber said its drivers are buying EVs at five times the rate of average motorists, but that prices remain a deterrent.\n\nBYD sells some of the world\u2019s cheapest electric cars, with its entry-level Seagull model costing slightly more than \u00a38,000 in China.\n\nCheap Chinese cars have raised concerns in the US where policymakers are introducing tariffs amid fears of domestic manufacturers being undercut.\n\nUber already offers US drivers discounts on Tesla cars but said the agreement with BYD was the \u201clargest global agreement of its kind\u201d.",

        "content": "Elon Musk recently spoke at an event, sharing his thoughts on Tesla\u2019s future and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). He compared Tesla\u2019s current situation to Nvidia\u2019s before its stock surge, predicting that companies strong in AI will dominate the market.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nMusk explained that Tesla is on the brink of significant growth, similar to Nvidia, saying, \u201cI do feel like maybe ... Tesla\u2019s kind of in a phase right now, like similar to what Nidia was in before ... Nvidia stock went bananas.\u201d\n\nHe also praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, saying, \u201cI have to say like Nvidia deserves the valuation ... they\u2019ve got ... Jensen and his team have done an amazing job.\u201d However, he emphasized that companies with strong AI capabilities will see their value increase more than those without. \u201cAny kind of AI company that is strong in AI is just going to be crazy.\u201d\n\nSee Also:Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFull Self-Driving Technology\n\nA major part of Tesla's AI strategy is full self-driving (FSD) technology. Musk stressed how this could change car usage because, according to him, cars are used about 10 hours a week, but with self-driving, they could be used up to 168 hours a week.\n\n\u201cThat would be a 10x increase in the productivity of the car, but it costs the same,\u201d Musk said before continuing, \u201cYou go from ... 20, 25% margins to 90% margins. It\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nHe went on to explain that when cars can drive themselves, Tesla owners could make money by sharing the car\u2019s earnings. In other words, your car could give rides to people when you\u2019re not using it, and you would get a portion of the money it makes. This extra income could be much more than what you pay for your car loan or lease and is in line with previous Musk statements on the subject.\n\nSee Also: Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nHumanoid Robots\n\nMusk also discussed Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus. He believes these robots could become important in different industries and homes. \u201cThe market for humanoid robots is in excess of 10 billion units,\u201d Musk said, predicting high demand for these robots.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201c[That\u2019s] more than the number of humans because people will each want one, and then there\u2019ll be others that are involved in industry ... if they do sell even at a volume for $20,000, that\u2019s $20 trillion, so it\u2019s like I mean it\u2019s just bananas numbers,\u201d further explained the Tesla CEO.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe Problem With Musk\u2019s Predictions\n\nWhile Musk is optimistic about Tesla\u2019s future and AI\u2019s potential, there are several reasons his predictions might not come true.\n\nFirst, there are regulatory hurdles. Getting approval for fully self-driving cars involves complex rules and regulations, which can delay or even stop the widespread use of self-driving cars.\n\nSecond, there are technical challenges. Creating AI that is reliable and safe for self-driving cars and robots is very difficult. Any setbacks in this area could slow down Tesla\u2019s progress.\n\nThird, there is market competition. The AI field is very competitive, with many companies investing a lot of money. Tesla will face strong competition from other tech giants and startups.\n\nFinally, economic factors play a role. Economic downturns or changes in the market could impact Tesla\u2019s stock and overall growth.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Elon Musk Says Tesla Now In A Similar Position Nvidia Was In Before Its Stock 'Went Bananas' \u2013 Thinks Strong AI Companies Will Dwarf Others originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Tech Stocks That Could Plunge in Q3",
        "content": "According to Goldman Sachs, investors are bullish on artificial intelligence in the long term, with over $1 trillion in spending projected by tech and utility firms. BlackRock researchers compared AI\u2019s impact to the Industrial Revolution. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), leading the AI revolution, saw a 175% stock increase in 12 months. Tech and communication companies investing heavily in AI now constitute 44% of the S&P 500.\n\nChristopher R. Jackson of UBS Wealth Management warned of potential risks due to the rapid rise in AI stocks, despite AI being a generational investment theme. He noted that investors might face turbulence if AI\u2019s expected productivity gains are delayed or less impactful.\n\nJim Covello of Goldman Sachs expressed skepticism about generative AI\u2019s future, noting its high costs and current limitations. He stated that for the significant investment to be justified, AI must solve complex problems that it isn\u2019t yet capable of.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCurrently, the tech sector faces a cold front as traders rotate out of overvalued tech stocks, seeking better opportunities in other sectors due to potential lower interest rates. High valuations are accepted until they aren\u2019t, presenting opportunities for long-term investors. These three overvalued tech stocks should be out of your investor portfolio (if you have them).\n\nTesla (TSLA) A black Tesla (TSLA) Model S is parked between rows of charging stations.\n\nSource: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.com\n\nStill a volatile stock to own these days, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is continuously putting their investors in concern due to market competition.\u00a0 In 2024, Tesla faced challenges but saw a 30% rise in July, achieving a 1.2% year-to-date return. Long-term potential hinges on AI and tech advancements, though many projects are distant. A 34% monthly surge raised overbought concerns, leading analysts at UBS to downgrade it to sell due to valuation issues. Better entry points may arise later.\n\nRJ Scaringe, CEO of EV competitor Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), says that Tesla\u2019s market share decline is due to market saturation. Moreover, Tesla\u2019s U.S. share fell below 50%, and profits fell 45% in the second quarter.\n\nTesla shares dropped 8% after again delaying is promised Robotaxi reveal. Declining EV sales and strong competition in China signal challenges ahead.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSilicon Valley-based Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is known for its cloud network services and Extensible Operating System. Its offerings are more efficient and scalable than those of its rivals. Arista also provides AI ethernet switching platforms and value-added software. Its AI network solutions have attracted investor attention, addressing a $60 billion total addressable market.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks, a key player in cloud networking for large enterprises, appears attractive to investors. However, analysts like Rosenblatt argue the company\u2019s AI opportunities are overestimated and its stock overpriced, predicting an imminent price correction.\n\nThe stock surged 51% in six months, prompting investors to consider taking profits. Initially recommended as a \u201cstrong buy\u201d in February, the stock\u2019s AI hype may have driven it too high too quickly. Its frothy price-to-earnings ratio suggests it might decline soon, especially if a market correction occurs. ANET shares, up 40% year-to-date, now trade at 41.5x forward earnings. Selling before next year would be wiser for investors.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) sells analog semiconductors and embedded processors across healthcare, communications, automotive, industrial, and personal electronics sectors. Despite diversification, profits remain cyclical, with no net income growth since the third quarter of 2022. Earnings for the first quarter of this year showed a 16% revenue decline and a 35% net income drop year-over-year.\n\nFree cash flow shrunk 79% year-over-year, dropping from $4.4 billion to $940 million, amid $3.7 billion in research and development and R&D and selling, general, and administrative expenses. With its current price above its 52-week average, TXN might be better revisited later as growth remains uncertain.\n\nTexas Instruments reported second-quarter 2024 results that met expectations. Revenue was $3.82 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint, and earnings per share were $1.22, aided by unanticipated items. Investors should watch the analog segment\u2019s performance, free cash flow trends, strategic investments in advanced manufacturing, and disciplined capital allocation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is the Rivian R2 the Key to Profitability and Stock Growth for RIVN Stock?",
        "content": "Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has popped recently. Rivian stock has gained approximately 16% over the past month.\n\nA significant portion of the gains have resulted from the June 26 announcement that Volkswagen Group (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) would invest up to $5 billion in Rivian as part of a joint venture between the two companies, focusing on next generation electronic architecture and software.\n\nAs a part of the deal, VW will initially invest $1 billion, with the remaining $4 billion to flow over the next three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, Volkswagen would become one of Rivian\u2019s largest shareholders alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who owned 16.4% as of April 24.\n\nWhile there is no doubt having deep pockets like VW to backstop Rivian\u2019s development will help keep it on a positive trajectory, these types of partnerships have a way of imploding before they\u2019ve delivered a reasonable return on investment for everyone involved.\n\nHowever, the money should help get Rivian\u2019s more affordable R2 up and running in 2026. That could make it the company\u2019s savior. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe Margins Have Got to Improve\n\nThe good news from Rivian\u2019s Q1 2024 report is that it only lost $38,784 per vehicle delivered in the quarter, down from $67,329 a year earlier, and from $43,372 in Q4 2023. It\u2019s headed in the right direction.\n\nThe problem is that it still lost $1.84 billion from operations during the first quarter, up slightly from a year earlier, on $1.20 billion revenue, nearly double a year earlier.\n\nAs a result, the accumulated deficit for Rivian stock at the end of March was a whopping $20.0 billion.\n\nIt will take a tremendous amount of profit to erase that deficit. Needless to say, it\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\n\nAt the very least, its gross margins will have to turn positive. They were -44% in the first quarter.\n\nBy comparison, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) took five years from Elon Musk first getting involved with the company in February 2004 to 2009 when it generated a gross profit on automotive sales of $9.5 million.\n\nRivian\u2019s first deliveries started in September 2021. If it\u2019s to match Tesla\u2019s pathway to profitability, it should start generating an automotive profit by late 2026, just as the R2 production gets going.\n\nThe R2 Is the Lowest Common Denominator\n\nI believe the best way to solve most problems is by focusing on the lowest common denominator.\n\nHere, it is generating a gross profit from the R2, which is expected to start at $45,000, well below the R1S ($75,000) and R1T ($70,000), you\u2019ll be able to make a boatload from your higher-priced vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian is following the Tesla road map by starting with more expensive vehicles and over time and profit, moving to more reasonably priced EVs. As longtime Tesla shareholders would tell you, it\u2019s made them plenty, so it\u2019s not the worst move.\n\nHowever, consider BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY).\n\nIts playbook is to keep prices low in China, its home market \u2013 its attractive BYD Dolphin EV sells for $16,500 in China \u2013 but makes it more expensive in international markets such as Germany, where it retails for $37,400.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Dolphin sold for between 39% and $178% higher outside China depending on the market.\n\nIn this case, and it\u2019s clearly an apples-t0-oranges comparison, BYD is subsidizing its Chinese sales with higher revenues per vehicle elsewhere. The lowest common denominator in this case is that the average German car buyer can still afford the Dolphin at inflated prices.\n\nThe R2 Growth and Rivian Stock\n\nThe R2, which is expected in the first half 2026, already has over 100,000 preorders. It got 68,000 in just one day when it introduced the R2 in March.\n\nThe company\u2019s plant in Normal, Illinois, will have an annual production capacity of 215,000 EVs by the time the R2 comes out. The lower-priced vehicle will represent 72% of the capacity with the R1S and R1T accounting for the rest.\n\nNot only will the launch of the R2 force the company to figure out how to make money from a vehicle that\u2019s $25,000 to $30,000 less than its other products, but it will add economies of scale to its operations, lowering its costs, getting it closer to gross profits rather than losses.\n\nAs my InvestorPlace colleague, Faisal Humayun recently pointed out, the R2 launch will generate cost savings of $2.25 billion relative to the company\u2019s original projections.\n\nFurther, the R3 launch after the R2, will cost even less than the R2. It will provide additional economies of scale to its overall operations.\n\nIf you\u2019re an aggressive investor, I would agree with Humayun\u2019s take to accumulate Rivian stock under $20. If not, buy VW stock instead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Uber Technologies and Chinese automaker BYD announced a multi-year partnership on Wednesday aimed at bringing 100,000 new electric vehicles to the ride-hailing platform globally.\n\nThe partnership, starting in Europe and Latin America, will offer drivers accessible pricing and financing for BYD's EVs on the Uber platform and will expand to markets in the Middle East, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the companies said.\n\nHigh sticker prices for electric vehicles and increased borrowing costs have acted as barriers to EV adoption over the past two years, causing demand for such vehicles to grow at a slower-than-expected pace.\n\nEscalating climate change concerns and the pressing need to cut greenhouse gas emissions has given a boost to the global push for electrification in the transportation sector.\n\nUber and BYD will offer drivers discounts on vehicle maintenance, charging, financing, and leasing depending on the market to support the transition to electric vehicles.\n\n\"When an Uber driver makes the switch to an EV, they can deliver up to four times the emissions benefits compared to a regular motorist, simply because they are on the road more,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.\n\nThe companies added that they will work together to integrate BYD's vehicles with self-driving technologies onto the ride-hailing platform.\n\nBYD's U.S rival Tesla is set to unveil its robotaxi product in October as it to looks to pivot after EV sales fell in the first two quarters of the year.\n\nBYD surpassed Tesla last year as the world's largest electric vehicle maker, though the Elon Musk-led EV maker has since regained the top spot.\n\nUber said in January it was working with Tesla to promote the use of EVs by its drivers in the U.S. as it aims to become emission-free in U.S. and Canadian cities by 2030.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What Are the Hottest EV Stocks Right Now? 3 Top Picks.",
        "content": "The electric vehicle industry has gone through difficult times in the last 12 to 18 months. EV stocks have corrected during this period on the back of sluggish growth and margin compression. However, business progress for some of the best EV companies remains positive. Once market sentiments change, these EV stocks are likely to surge higher from attractive levels. This column discusses three of the hottest EV stocks to buy for near- and long-term uptrend.\n\nI believe that the next 12 to 18 months are critical for the EV industry. The winners will clearly be separated from the laggards and losers during this period. Some EV stocks will surge higher while others will continue to destroy wealth.\n\nTherefore, stock selection is the key in an intensely competitive industry. In my view, the ideas discussed represent EV companies that are positioned to survive challenging times and emerge stronger in the coming years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) badge on back end of red Tesla car\n\nSource: Hadrian / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is no doubt that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the hottest EV stock to buy. On April 22, TSLA stock touched closing lows of $142. From those levels, there has been a strong rally of 63%. However, if we look at the chart on a 12-month basis, TSLA stock has delivered negative returns of 13%. Therefore, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate before the innovation driven EV company surges higher.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in May, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO had opined that Tesla is \u201cfar ahead\u201d in self-driving cars. The global autonomous taxi ecosystem is expected to be worth $8 trillion to $10 trillion. Cathie Wood estimates that Tesla can potentially capture 50% of the market. According to Wood, this can translate into TSLA stock surging 10-fold by 2030.\n\nAnother potential positive is the impending launch of low-cost cars. Tesla is working on its \u201cunboxed model\u201d that\u2019s likely to cut manufacturing costs to half. If this is achieved, Tesla can make significant inroads in emerging markets.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock has plunged by almost 50% for year-to-date. The deep correction has been on the back of growth expectations being revised on the downside. The news of tariffs in the European Union has also depressed sentiments.\n\nHowever, there are few positives to note. First, Li Auto currently only has a presence in China. With retail expansion within the country and launch of new models, growth is likely to remain healthy. International expansion might be on the cards in 2025 with the possibility of entering the Middle East markets where regulations are friendly.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Li Auto has a strong balance sheet and ended Q1 2024 with a cash buffer of $13.7 billion. This provides ample flexibility to invest in innovation. Li Auto is on-track to launch level 3 self-driving technology by 2025. As the market for autonomous driving swells globally, Li Auto is positioned to benefit.\n\nRivian (RIVN) rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock traded at 52-week lows of $8.3 in April. From those depressed levels, RIVN stock has doubled. The big rally has been on the back of the announcement related to the joint venture with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). I expect the positive momentum to sustain in the coming quarters.\n\nLast month, Rivian\u2019s joint venture with Volkswagen will create the next generation of software-defined vehicle platforms that both companies will use. As a part of the joint venture, Volkswagen will be investing $5 billion in Rivian with the initial cash infusion being $1 billion.\n\nAn obvious advantage for Rivian is the cash infusion. The company is going through a phase of significant cash burn. Another potential advantage is that the joint venture might be the first step towards establishing a bigger presence in Europe.\n\nBetween a strong cash buffer and partnering with Volkswagen, sentiments have turned positive for Rivian. Further, there is an impending launch of R2, R3 and R3X in 2026 that will contribute to growth and cost reductions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTech stocks led the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lower Tuesday as the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) closed at the lowest level since early June.\n\nIt was the fourth day the tech-heavy index lost 1.5% or more in the month of July, especially notable as there had not been any losses of that magnitude in the two prior months.\n\nAhead of June's Consumer Price Index reading on July 11, the Nasdaq 100 had been up 23% year to date. But after the CPI registered its first monthly drop in inflation since 2020, investors kicked off a stomach-churning rotation from large stocks into small.\n\nSince then, the Nasdaq has surrendered half those gains, sending many investors into relative shock upon learning that the laggard Russell 2000 index (^RUT) has nearly caught up to the volatile index known as home to the largest tech players.\n\n\"[I] didn\u2019t have [the] Russell 2000 catching the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date on my bingo card to start this month. Getting close,\" wrote Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and former NYSE floor governor.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is now sporting a better return this year than the artificial intelligence-fueled S&P Select Tech SPDR Fund (XLK) \u2014 and it's only a few points away from catching the S&P 500.\n\nIn the month of June alone, the Nasdaq outperformed the Russell 2000 by over 7 percentage points. Then, in July, the relationship violently inverted such that the Russell outperformed the Nasdaq by nearly 14 percentage points. It's the biggest month-to-month flip in leadership that we have data for, going back to 1988.\n\nThe narrative in the press followed the rotation as grave concerns over market concentration in the Magnificent Seven gave way to a small-cap miracle rally.\n\nTo be clear, sector rotation is a healthy feature of bull markets. When a leading group of stocks takes a back seat, other pockets of the market should take their place such that \u2014 at the index level \u2014 volatility is subdued. Extremes on either side average out.\n\nBut, given the speed and strength of the recent move, Wall Street is now assessing the damage to institutional portfolios.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley's derivatives team, \"volatility of the last two weeks started out being very rotational.\"\n\nHowever, as the move gained steam, institutions began reining in leverage (borrowed money) and reducing directional bets on stocks. \"What began as a de-grossing event has quickly turned more towards a shift in directional exposure to equities,\" the team continued.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this, and there's still a Fed meeting later today and a Meta quarterly report to close July.

        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng has expanded use of its self-driving system to all cities in mainland China in a bid to attract more local users ahead of the China debut of Tesla's competing software, known as Full Self-Driving (FSD).\n\nWith the move, Guangzhou-based Xpeng becomes the first mainland carmaker to make a semi-autonomous driving system operational nationwide.\n\nThe latest version of the X NGP (Xpeng navigation guided pilot) advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) will take a big leap this year to promote self-driving technologies in the world's largest automotive and EV market, according to He Xiaopeng, Xpeng's co-founder and CEO.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"The year 2024 is marking a watershed for the development of autonomous driving,\" He told a virtual briefing on Tuesday evening. \"For Xpeng, our mission is to make our technologies accessible to people around the country.\"\n\nCompatible Xpeng cars in China and abroad can access the new software through an over-the-air update that became available on Tuesday evening.\n\nX NGP enables vehicles to recognise traffic lights, turn, change lanes and overtake other vehicles. It was being tested in more than 300 mainland cities before the official announcement. Drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times because human intervention is still required under many circumstances.\n\nXpeng, a partner of Volkswagen Group, is viewed as a Chinese leader in developing self-driving technologies, and X NGP is seen as the country's answer to Tesla's FSD, which will not be tested in China until the end of 2024.\n\nX NGP is offered on the mainland for free. In the US, Tesla charges US$8,000 to install FSD, on top of a US$99 monthly subscription.\n\nXpeng, founded in 2014, launched X NGP early last year, but it could only be used in major cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. The company rolled the ADAS out to other cities at an orderly pace amid rising penetration of smart EVs on the mainland.\n\n\"A high level of autonomy is one driver of sales growth, since young motorists are now attracted by intelligent features of electric cars,\" said Eric Han, a senior manager at Suolei, an advisory firm in Shanghai. \"Tesla's FSD has long been expected by drivers in China, and X NGP must step up a gear to lure more Chinese customers before the US carmaker puts its ADAS in operation here.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe Xiaopeng, co-founder and CEO of Guangzhou-based Xpeng. Photo: Xpeng alt=He Xiaopeng, co-founder and CEO of Guangzhou-based Xpeng. Photo: Xpeng>\n\nAt the end of May, Reuters reported that Tesla was preparing to register FSD with Chinese authorities, paving the way for it to be tested on mainland roads.\n\nXpeng delivered 141,601 vehicles to mainland buyers in 2023, up 17 per cent year on year.\n\nTesla, the front-runner in China's premium EV segment, delivered 603,664 units on the mainland last year, up 37 per cent from 2022, making it the country's second-largest market. In the US, the company's largest market, sales increased by a quarter to 654,888 in 2023.\n\nXpeng plans to spend a record 3.5 billion yuan (US$483 million) in 2024 on developing intelligent cars, He said at the briefing.\n\nLast month, the company unveiled its first model under the new Mona sub-brand, as it explores the compact car segment in a challenge to market leader BYD.\n\nThe company will officially launch the Mona brand next month and unveil details about its growth strategy and development plan for the product line-up.\n\nThe brand's models will be equipped with autonomous driving systems and priced at 100,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan, He told an EV forum in Beijing in March.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 31, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and Tesla TSLA.\n\nTime to Buy the World's Most Valuable Company as Earnings Approach\n\nAs the world\u2019s most valuable company, markets will pay close attention to results for Apple\u2019s fiscal third quarter on Thursday, August 1.\n\nEdging Microsoft with a market cap of over $3.3 trillion, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy Apple\u2019s stock as earnings approach.\n\nApple\u2019s Q3 Expectations\n\nRanging from games to subscriptions for movies and music, services revenue has helped sustain Apple\u2019s robust top line. Along with its iconic app store, this includes Apple Pay and AppleCare with Q3 Services revenue expected to spike 13% to $23.99 billion.\n\nHowever, Product revenue which is led by Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone is expected to dip to $60.06 billion compared to $60.58 billion in the comparative quarter. Overall, Apple\u2019s Q3 sales are still projected to rise 3% to $84.38 billion.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple\u2019s Q2 EPS is thought to have increased 6% to $1.34 versus $1.26 per share a year ago. Notably, Apple has surpassed bottom line expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nWall Street will be looking for updates on Apple\u2019s plans to expand into generative AI which will concentrate on personal intelligence systems for the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. Apple is also testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool called \u201cASK\u201d for AppleCare Support along with upgrading its digital voice assistant Siri.\n\nApple has stated it believes in the transformative power and promise of AI and has the advantages to differentiate itself in the new era of tech. The company has worked closely with Taiwan Semiconductor in this regard which provides the M3 chip for its MacBook Air. Apple deems the MacBook Air as the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance including a more powerful neural engine.\n\nYTD Performance\n\nYear to date, Apple\u2019s stock is up a respectable +12% although this has slightly trailed the broader indexes and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers outside of Microsoft and Tesla.\n\nMonitoring Apple\u2019s Valuation\n\nChecking out one of Apple\u2019s key fundamental valuation metrics, AAPL currently commands a modest premium to the broader market at 33.1X forward earnings compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 23X. It\u2019s noteworthy that Apple trades below its decade-long high of 38.6X forward earnings but noticeably above the median of 18.1X.\n\nStory continues\n\nTakeaway\n\nAhead of its Q3 report, Apple\u2019s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Reaching or exceeding quarterly expectations may be crucial to more upside in Apple\u2019s stock as its valuation does allude to the notion that there could be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nThat said, Apple is a cash cow that has the resources to expand and potentially capitalize on artificial intelligence which could be very rewarding for long-term investors.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Elon Musk Reaffirms Interest in Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Warns Against Crypto Scams\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, voiced a positive outlook on Bitcoin, acknowledging its value and hinting at an appreciation for other digital currencies, while reiterating his fondness for Dogecoin.\n\nSpeaking at an X Takeover event, Musk stated, \"I do think there's some merit in Bitcoin and maybe some of the other crypto,\" without specifying which cryptocurrencies he had in mind. He also expressed his affection for Dogecoin, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency featuring a Shiba Inu dog. \"I sort of have a soft spot for Dogecoin because I just like dogs and memes,\" he added, showcasing his playful approach to the crypto world.\n\nDespite his personal interest, Musk emphasized that he does not actively promote cryptocurrencies. Addressing the misuse of his image in crypto scams, he stated, \"I'm not going to be promoting crypto\u2014at most, in a joking way.\" He further cautioned, \"If you see me pumping crypto, it's not me.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO's image has been exploited in various scams, from hacking his Twitter account to creating fake advertisements and deepfake videos, deceiving unsuspecting victims into parting with substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. At the X Takeover event, Musk advised users to be vigilant against scams, urging them to \"double check whether that is real\" when encountering crypto-related promotions.\n\nTesla, under Musk's leadership, continues to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin. Analysts have determined that the company's Bitcoin holdings remained stable in the last quarter of 2023, valued at approximately $387 million with over 9,720 BTC. This information, sourced from Bitcoin Treasuries, highlights Tesla's ongoing commitment to cryptocurrency as part of its corporate treasury.\n\nMusk's stance on cryptocurrency has seen numerous shifts. In 2021, he briefly announced that Tesla would accept Bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, an initiative that was quickly retracted. Nonetheless, the company maintains its Bitcoin holdings. Additionally, Musk has been a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, even suggesting that Tesla might eventually accept it as a form of payment.\n\nView comments",

No charges have been filed, he said.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d should be able to run without human supervision by the end of this year. He has been promising a fleet of robotaxis for several years. During the company\u2019s earnings conference call, he acknowledged that his predictions on the issue \u201chave been overly optimistic in the past.\u201d\n\nAfter the crash in a suburban area about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Seattle, the driver told a trooper that he was using Tesla's Autopilot system and looked at his cellphone while the Tesla was moving.\n\n\u201cThe next thing he knew there was a bang and the vehicle lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him,\u201d the trooper wrote in a probable-cause document.\n\nThe 56-year-old driver was arrested for investigation of vehicular homicide \u201cbased on the admitted inattention to driving, while on Autopilot mode, and the distraction of the cell phone while moving forward, putting trust in the machine to drive for him,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nThe motorcyclist, Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was under the car and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities reported.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "California city rolls out all-electric police fleet, first in US",
        "content": "A California city officially ditched gas-powered police cars and made the switch to a fully electric fleet for its police department.\n\nSouth Pasadena, located northeast of Los Angeles, on Monday rolled out the South Pasadena Police Department\u2019s (SPPD) all-electric fleet consisting of 20 Teslas, including 10 Model Ys and 10 Model 3s, according to a press release.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBy transitioning to only Tesla police vehicles, the SPPD \"became the nation\u2019s first law enforcement agency to completely replace its gas-powered vehicles with non-polluting electric vehicles,\" the city said. The South Pasadena Police Department is the nation\u2019s first law enforcement agency to deploy an all-electric fleet.\n\nThe city said the switch to Tesla police vehicles should bring both energy and maintenance cost savings. For energy specifically, the EVs should result in annual savings of roughly $4,000 per vehicle, according to South Pasadena.\n\nIt also said the EV police vehicles will environmentally benefit its city of 25,000 people, noting gas-powered police cars are \"particularly high emitters\" of pollution due to how often they tend to stand idle during the course of duty.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"This transition reflects the city\u2019s vision of a sustainable future based on both sound fiscal management and environmental stewardship,\" Mayor Evelyn Zneimer said in a statement.\n\nCALIFORNIA POLICE DEPARTMENT UNVEILS TESLA MODEL Y PATROL VEHICLES, CYBERTRUCKS COULD BE NEXT\n\nThe city pegged the net costs of the all-electric fleet project at $1.85 million, including the \"cost of the EV chargers and lease payments\" to Enterprise Fleet Management, the company South Pasadena worked with to obtain the 20 vehicles.\n\nTo help power the new fleet, South Pasadena already set up 34 chargers outside its city hall. It is also adding a \"solar powered system with battery storage\" there, as well as at the police and fire stations, for backup, the city said.\n\nMore than 50% of the project\u2019s costs are \"being met by the City\u2019s project partners,\" the city said.\n\nThe all-electric fleet has been in the works for quite some time. South Pasadena conducted research for several years before getting the go-head from the city council to pursue the initiative, the SPPD said on its website.\n\nLast year, SPPD EV Project Transition Lead Sgt. Tony Abdalla said the cost savings \"are undeniable and being able to bring Tesla\u2019s entire suite of crash and safety systems to bear on officer safety is an added benefit above and beyond the economics of operating and maintaining this modern EV fleet.\"\n\nSouth Pasadena is deploying its Model Ys for patrol and its Model 3s for detective and administrative work.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth types of vehicles were \"up-fitted\" by Unplugged Performance.\n\nFOX Business' Louis Casiano contributed to this report\n\nOriginal article source:California city rolls out all-electric police fleet, first in US\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. released a software update to 1.85 million cars in the US to guard against its vehicles\u2019 hoods flying open during driving.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nLuxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Herm\u00e8s Fortune Has Vanished Rich Hong Kong Families Sell Mansions at Discounts to Repay Debt Venezuela\u2019s Opposition Disputes Claim of Maduro Election Victory Harris\u2019 Running-Mate Search Zeroes In on Three Top Contenders Tesla Analyst Nearly Crashes While Using \u2018Full Self-Driving\u2019\n\nBeginning on June 18, the carmaker deployed the over-the-air software update to detect whether the hoods of its vehicles are open and notify customers, according to a recall report posted to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s website on Tuesday. The fix went to Tesla Model S, X, 3 and Y vehicles produced as early as January 2020 and as recently as this month.\n\nTesla said in the report that it began investigating customer complaints of \u201cunintended hood opening events\u201d in China in late March. By mid-April, the company identified the issue: deformation of latch switches that could prevent customers from being notified their hoods were open.\n\nFor reasons unknown, the rate at which this occurs has been higher in China compared to markets in Europe and North America, according to the company. As of July 20, Tesla identified three warranty claims or field reports pertaining to the issue in the US, and it isn\u2019t aware of any related crashes, injuries or deaths. The automaker estimates that 1% of the vehicles involved in the recall had the defect.\n\nTesla shares fell as much as 1.7% as of 9:35 a.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock had dropped 6.6% this year through Monday\u2019s close, trailing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 Index.\n\n(Updates with share move during regular trading in the laast paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship The Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools How Sonny Angels and Smiskis Took Over TikTok Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wall Street offered a mixed performance last week, with the S&P 500 losing 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 0.8%. The Nasdaq was off 2.1% last week. The Russell 2000 has advanced 3.5% last week. The tech slump weighed on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.\n\nWall Street\u2019s tech crash last week was mainly driven by Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL earnings report, which highlighted increased capital expenses. Tesla Inc.\u2019s TSLA stock also suffered following its earnings results due to a lack of details from CEO Elon Musk on the company's self-driving vehicle efforts.\n\nMany feared that the huge AI investments made by big tech companies would pay off later than expected. The scale of profitability of those investments is also unknown now, while the high valuation of AI stocks became a concern for many investors (read: Time for Covered Call ETFs?).\n\nInside Q2 U.S. GDP Data\n\nAnother key event last week was the release of the Q2 GDP growth data for the U.S. economy, which expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in the second quarter of 2024. The advance estimate of second-quarter U.S. GDP revealed that the economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% in Q2, well above the 2% growth expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The reading came in higher than the first-quarter GDP, which was revised down to 1.4% (read: Small-Cap ETFs to Rally on Upbeat U.S. Q2 GDP Growth Data?).\n\nEther ETFs Receive Final Approval From SEC\n\nETFs holding ether (ETH) officially started to trade in the United States on Jul 23, 2024, following the final approval from regulators on Jul 22, 2024. This put the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency in an investment vehicle favored by many professional investors and advisors.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale and 21 Shares, as announced by the companies (read: Ether ETFs Receive Final Approval From SEC).\n\nBiden\u2019s Exit From Presidential Race\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his presidential campaign on Jul 21, 2024. His departure was probably prompted by concerns from party officials about his ability to serve a second term at the age of 81. However, he plans to complete the remaining three months of his term.\n\nBiden also announced his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president. However, it doesn\u2019t ensure that she will automatically get the nomination (read: AI Stocks & ETFs to Rally on Likely Harris Trade?).\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning inverse/leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nDirexion Daily Regional Banks Bull 3X Shares DPST \u2013 Up 17.4%\n\nAs the Fed is likely to cut rates in September, the yield curve steepened and benefitted bank stocks as these increase banks\u2019 net interest rate margin. Plus, the space is undervalued at the current level.\n\nDirexion Daily Aerospace & Defense Bull 3X Shares DFEN \u2013 Up 15.5%\n\nSome upbeat earnings results from aerospace and defense stocks probably have boosted the fund. L3Harris LHX beat Q2 earnings estimates and upped \u201924 EPS view. RTX Corporation\u2019s RTX also beat on both lines and hiked full-year sales guidance. Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC too surpassed estimates on both lines and boosted full-year sales outlook.\n\nProShares UltraShort Ether ETF ETHD \u2013 Up 13.7%\n\nAs the tech stocks crashed in the middle of last week, ether ETFs probably fell due to the retreat of the risk-on trade sentiments. As a result, inverse-leveraged ether ETF gained materially.\n\nDirexion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3x Shares LABU \u2013 Up 12.7%\n\nBiotech stocks have likely surged due to the anticipated Fed rate cuts and the prospects of lower interest rates ahead. Plus, the space has been thriving with innovations and FDA approvals.\n\nTradr 2X Short TSLA Daily ETF TSLQ \u2013 Up 12.4%\n\nTesla posted mixed second-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. CEO Elon Musk\u2019s lack of detailing on the company's self-driving vehicle initiative also weighed on the stock and boosted its inverse-leveraged form.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tesla ETFs: Time to Buy or Hold Post Lackluster Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "Tesla TSLA shares gained 5.6% on Monday after Morgan Stanley named the most valuable automaker its \"top pick\" in the U.S. automotive industry, replacing Ford F, as quoted on Reuters.\n\nThe Tesla stock has moved down 8.4% past week due to a lack of details from CEO Elon Musk on the company's self-driving vehicle efforts when it reported second-quarter 2024 earnings. The electric vehicle (EV) giant\u2019ssecond-quarter results also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nTSLA even became one of the worst-performing stocks of the S&P 500 in the initial phase of this year. However, luck is turning in Tesla\u2019s favor. Over the past month, Tesla has gained 10.6%.\n\nThe brokerage house Morgan Stanley said that Tesla's energy business could grow to be worth more than the company's auto business in the future due to the rising importance of climate concerns.\n\nHow Will Tesla\u2019s Energy Business Help?\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Tesla to take a more dominant position in the market for zero-emission vehicle credit revenues, for which it recognized around $2,000 per unit in the second quarter, as legacy automakers are somewhat backing off on or slowing their EV expansion plans.\n\n\"We estimate Tesla may account for as much as half the credit sales in the market, supporting a 100% margin business for Tesla that may not be anticipated by the investment community at this time,\" Morgan Stanley analysts revealed, as quoted on Reuters.\n\nTesla\u2019s Foray Into AI Regime: Will It Be Successful?\n\nTSLA has been reforming itself from a car company to a technology and robotics company, mainly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving technology. The company is betting big on driverless software and artificial intelligence in an attempt to revive sales.\n\nHowever, Morgan Stanley raised concerns over Tesla's ability to commercialize autonomous driving technology in China and the future of EV demand. The company may again come under regulatory scrutiny over safety concerns.\n\nTesla is slated to introduce \u201crobotaxis\u201d \u2014 a driverless car without a steering wheel or pedals \u2014 in October 2024. The launch has been delayed. The next-generation vehicle was once widely thought to be the key to the electric automaker\u2019s survival, especially as competition heats up in the EV space. But now, the sure-shot success of the launch has triggered concerns.\n\nIn late April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company would spend about $10 billion this year on training and inference AI. Tesla's emphasis on AI and autonomous driving is seen as potentially transformative amid the current AI buzz. But again, we are yet to see any proper direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Tesla Awaiting Improved Profit Margins?\n\nMany analysts predict improved profit margins for Tesla in the days ahead, thanks to lower production and raw material costs. The company is likely to record a 36.52% growth next year versus 26.90% expected growth for the Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry and a 9.31% growth anticipated for the S&P 500. Over the next five years, Tesla\u2019s growth rate is expected to be 21.60% versus the underlying industry\u2019s growth rate of 16.40%.\n\nEV Space Gaining Gradual Momentum, Albeit Very Slowly\n\nElectric car sales were robust in the first quarter of 2024, having grown 25% year over year. Since 2021, first-quarter electric car sales have typically made up 15-20% of the total global annual sales, per International Energy Agency or IEA.\n\nThe major share of first-quarter 2024 sales growth came from China. IEA forecasts 2024 EV sales to log a year-over-year increase of 20%. EVs are likely to command more than one-fifth share of the total car sales.\n\nWall of Worry\n\nCybertruck, Tesla\u2019s first new consumer model in years, has been slow to gain momentum. The success of driverless cars is yet to be known. Margins on the EV business are still lackluster. Analysts are also not overly optimistic about Tesla, as two out of 12 analysts raised TSLA\u2019s earnings estimates for 2024 over the past seven days, while eight analysts cut the same. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAgreed, Tesla more than doubled its \u2018all-time-high\u2019 quarterly deployment numbers for energy storage in the second quarter of 2024. Then again, energy generation and storage revenues make up less than 10% of the total revenues. Even if the gross profit of this segment grows more than 100%, the contribution is less likely to be meaningful at the current level.\n\nBroker Rating\n\nTesla currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 3.09 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 35 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 2.91 a month ago based on 35 recommendations. Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nInvestors seeking to tap the short-term uptrend in Tesla (due to Morgan Stanley\u2019s bullish comments) may buy ETFs having a substantial allocation to this luxury carmaker as the ETF approach minimizes company-specific concentration risks. Otherwise, it is better to wait for more solid cues related to margin improvement and success related to self-driving cars before betting big on Tesla.\n\nThe ETFs include Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares TSLL, MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, Simplify Volt Robocar Disruption and Tech ETF VCAR and ARK Innovation ETF ARKK.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And I like it for tech.\u201d\n\nAmid a decline in EV sales growth, Elon Musk\u2019s only option is to go all-in on AI. After a Twitter poll that overwhelmingly voted in favor of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) investing capital in xAI, Musk\u2019s AI company, the CEO of Tesla said he\u2019d discuss investing $5 billion in xAI with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nElon Musk said in a latest earnings call with analysts that massive discounts from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitors created headwinds for the company in the most recently reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also delayed its robotaxi event until October. All possible catalysts for Tesla stock lie far into the future and the reality is revealing itself to Elon Musk who admitted during the\u00a0latest earnings call that he\u2019s been overly optimistic about robo taxis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that \u2014 to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.\u201d\n\nDuring the second quarter, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0automotive gross margin fell to 18.47% from 19.22% the previous year. Non-automotive revenue, now 22% of total sales compared to 14.67% in Q2 2023, has a lower gross margin, negatively impacting overall profitability. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0\u00a0is still heavily reliant on EVs where demand is falling. Tesla energy business is not strong enough to offset declines in the core business.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. In our view, Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results, where revenues and earnings missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Weaker-than-expected automotive revenues were partly driven by a reduced average selling price, which was down 15% year-over-year. Moreover, management decided to forgo providing volume guidance, though they did acknowledge they are in a lower growth phase given the uncertain consumer environment particularly as it relates to high ticket purchases.\u201d\n\nOverall, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Proved Again Why It's the Best Buy of the Group",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been a dominant group in the market over the past few years. It's made up of:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMy top Magnificent Seven stock to buy just reported its latest results, and they were outstanding. However, the market didn't reward the stock, and it's down alongside the rest of the group. Is this a buying opportunity for one of the best stocks on Wall Street? I think so.\n\nAlphabet's business is rising steadily\n\nMy favorite stock in the Magnificent Seven right now is Alphabet. Over the past year, Alphabet has posted some excellent results and is starting to perfect its artificial intelligence (AI) product offering.Additionally, its advertising segment (which accounts for around three-fourths of all revenue) is doing well for how mature the business segment is. In the second quarter, sales rose 11% year over year to $64.6 billion. W\n\nWhile some investors may be concerned that this growth isn't nearly as quick as it needs to be for Alphabet to stand out, I don't view it that way. Alphabet's ad segment is a reliable business that creates massive cash flows for the company, allowing it to invest in next-generation technology like AI. It also funds the growth of another vital segment: Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the smallest of the big three cloud computing players. This size disadvantage can be traced back to Google's late entry into this market, but it's still growing quickly. In Q2, revenue grew 29% year over year to $10.3 billion. It also posted an operating margin of 11%, which is still far behind what industry leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivered in the first quarter with a 38% margin. Once Google Cloud reaches scale and improves its operating margin to similar levels, this segment will provide a meaningful profit boost, although that is still some years away.\n\nAltogether, Alphabet's quarter was solid, with revenue growing 14% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.44 to $1.89. It was hard to find a fault in the quarter, but it was also difficult to find a \"wow\" moment.\n\nThe stock fell 5% the day after trading, dragging the rest of the market down with it. But I think this pullback is a mistake and provides investors with an opportunity to get into the stock, now that it's down around 10% from its highs.\n\nUnlike its peers, the stock doesn't have an expensive premium\n\nFor the most part, the Magnificent Seven stocks are incredibly pricey when compared to the broader market. However, Alphabet doesn't have the same premium, so investors don't have as much risk on the table by investing in Alphabet. After the pullback, Alphabet's stock trades for 23 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that only retraces its valuation to a few months ago, it prices it in the vicinity of the broader S&P 500 index, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings. When you buy Alphabet stock at these levels, you're essentially buying an above-average company for a market-average price. That's a great deal, and investors should take advantage of it.\n\nThrough Alphabet's consistent revenue growth, expanding dividend, and aggressive share repurchase programs (Alphabet repurchased over $15 billion in stock during Q2), it's a shoo-in for a company that can grow earnings faster than 10% annualized. That's a fantastic investment proposition, and it's one that investors need to understand.\n\nYou don't have to hit a home run every time you invest. Sometimes, the steady growers that can outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year are the best investments, and I think Alphabet falls into this category.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk called lithium the \u201cnew oil\u201d and invested in what\u2019s now the largest processor of the element in North America. Indeed, demand for lithium, used for the rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles (EVs), has increased as more people move away from gasoline-powered cars and car manufacturers produce cleaner vehicles.\n\nLithium is the lightest metal. That makes it ideal and useful for various products, from pacemakers to jets to electric and hybrid vehicles. The metal is being touted as integral to a low-carbon future, and demand is expected to grow double digits over the next half a decade. EVs \u2014 the next biggest thing in automotives \u2014 will be the primary mover for this demand.\n\nHere are the hottest lithium stocks to watch out for as we gear up into the next few years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it. favorite Lithium stocks\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nStandard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) is a near-commercial lithium company developing a portfolio of large, high-quality lithium-brine properties in the U.S. The company runs its main projects from the Smackover Formation \u2014 a premier lithium brine resource in Arkansas and Texas. However, SLI is still working on becoming a fully-fledged lithium extraction and purification production.\n\nSince it\u2019s not fully integrated yet, Standard Lithium has a lot of room to adapt and refine its operational strategy. It has already achieved notable success with its first commercial-scale direct lithium extraction (DLE) column at the Demonstration Plant near El Dorado, Arkansas. The project is the only of its kind operating in North America.\n\nOn the financial front, the firm is demonstrating good health. For its fiscal third quarter ending in March this year, Standard Lithium announced earnings of ($0.04) per share. That performance topped analyst forecasts of ($0.05) by $0.01. Also, it did not have any term debt or revolving credit at the time. It\u2019s one of the best lithium stocks to consider at the moment.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO) lithium (LI) on the periodic table. top performing lithium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a global mining company with more than 150 years of mining and processing experience. Its portfolio of minerals and chemical elements includes iron ore, copper, aluminium, lithium and more.\n\nThe company has two main lithium projects. One is the Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina, where it extracts and produces battery-grade lithium carbonate from raw brine. The other is the Jadar Project in Serbia\u2019s Jadar Valley.\n\nThough its share price has been trading sideways for the bigger part of this year, Rio Tinto shows plenty of promise and is one of the best picks for lithium stocks going into the rest of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has favorable analyst ratings, with 7 out of 10 giving it a Buy or Overweight recommendation. Moreover, HSBC upgraded its rating from Hold to Buy for the firm\u2019s stock this month. At the time, the banking group cited strong Q2 2024 operational performance and Rio\u2019s ability to increase production volumes faster than its competitors.\n\nSigma Lithium (SGML) a lithium mine, ATLX stock. Lithium Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSigma Lithium (NASDAQ:SGML) is a mineral explorer that supplies environmentally sustainable and high-purity lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The Canada-based company\u00a0produces Triple Zero Green Lithium from its Grota do Cirilo Project in Brazil. It also has a 100% ownership stake in four mineral properties in the South American country: Grota do Cirilo, Sao Jose, Santa Clara and Genipapo.\n\nThe company registered robust results for Q1 of this year, with an 11% rise in lithium prices, and established itself as the world\u2019s second-lowest-cost producer of lithium concentrate. Also, it increased its mineral reserves by 40% and nearly doubled its annual production capacity to 520,000 tons.\n\nAnd it looks like the company\u2019s fundamentals will get even stronger in the coming years, making it an interesting lithium stock to watch. Its undeveloped project in Brazil is worth $5.1 billion. The company forecasts the project will supply battery-grade lithium for the next 13 years once complete.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Top Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Investing in the technology sector continues to be an excellent choice overall. This chart shows the sector-by-sector returns from the S&P 500 between 2009 and 2023. It indicates that the tech and information technology sector has been the best performer on an annual basis during that period. That alone speaks to the logic for investing in the tech sector for the long haul.\n\nAdmittedly, purchasing buy and hold stocks within the tech sector can feel daunting. The volatility over the past few years does raise concerns for some. And, 2022 was a particularly strong example of such fears. However, it\u2019s necessary to keep the long-term picture in mind. The tech sector remains the best performer during that 14-year period even with the inclusion of dramatic tech downturns of 2022.\n\nToday, long haul tech stocks are likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, cybersecurity, blockchain and a host of new innovations. Growth will be high and investing in strong companies is your best bet.\u00a0Let\u2019s delve into the top performers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) provides the digital oil that fuels a lot of the innovation in tech. The company is the foundry to the world. It provides chip manufacturing services to just about everyone in the rapidly growing chip market. Also known as TSMC, it produces 60% of chips globally and 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced chips. It\u2019s entirely reasonable to consider TSMC as the keystone firm in the tech supply chain.\n\nThat position and its location have made investing in TSMC undeniably risky. Few other firms carry the political risk that TSMC does due to its location in Taiwan. It is front and center in the ongoing battle between the U.S. and China.\n\nAlso, the company could face new tariffs if Donald Trump is re-elected in November. The risks are clear and several. However, no other company is capable of doing that which TSMC does. The U.S. is trying to subsidize chip production back to American soil but that will favor TSMC as it is building foundries in Arizona. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is trying to get onto the same playing field as TSMC, but that seems like a pipe dream at this point. This all suggests that TSMC continues to be an excellent choice for the long haul.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is wavering as I write this article. Fresh concerns about AI profitability and antitrust probes are big factors in that.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough this piece is about buy and hold factors related to Apple, I\u2019d like to briefly point out an opportunity. Apple\u2019s Q3 results are coming out August 1. Revenues and earnings are expected to increase by 10% and 13%, respectively, year-over-year (YOY). Mac sales and Apple\u2019s services segments continue to improve. Further, iPhone sales \u2013 which truly drive the stock \u2013 are also improving. That should be a strong positive signal to the market that Apple is truly coming back.\n\nA lot has been written about the AI opportunity for Apple. I\u2019ll skip that because all there really is to know at this point is that the company has launched AI. The other exciting piece of news for the long term is that Apple is on the cusp of producing in-house wireless chips. That will move it away from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in the near future. It should make Apple a more complete tech giant once it has a firmer grasp on chip production. The long term looks very promising for Apple.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) disappointed with its Q2 earnings report released July 23. This snippet explains the trouble for the stock well: \u201cthe electric vehicle maker reported a 45% year-over-year decline in profits for the second quarter, missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that demand for Tesla\u2019s EVs is sagging at the moment. As a result, prices are falling. So, Tesla has to lower production costs while introducing cheaper vehicles. That task creates an opportunity for investors as share prices hit a lull.\n\nWe know Tesla is highly likely to be a long-term beneficiary of the AI boom. The company continues to develop autonomous driving capabilities as well as its AI-enabled humanoid robot known as Optimus. Recently, the company debuted the second generation model of Optimus at a tech conference in Shanghai.\n\nTesla is positioning itself as one of the leaders in the AI robot space. Not only could that drastically reduce internal labor costs in the future, but also it could create a huge external revenue stream in the process. Tesla isn\u2019t the clear-cut EV winner it once was as China rises, and that doubt creates a strong entry point for long-term thinkers.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) dominates the customer relationship marketing space with a market share exceeding that of the next four biggest firms combined. That makes it the king of customer connections for the 11th consecutive year. Further, customer relationship management is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 14% through 2030.\n\nThat combination of factors alone makes Salesforce a stock to consider for the long term. In the short term, rate cuts are on the horizon. Salesforce is one of a select group of growth stocks that many are fixating on in relation to that opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce offers a comprehensive platform that goes beyond CRM alone. It was also one of the first CRMs to utilize a standalone cloud platform.\n\nAI will be a big part of Salesforce\u2019s future. The company is working to address the unreliability of generative AI that has played the tech in its early developmental stages. The company clearly hopes to stand out as a reliable AI service that enterprises can count on. AI hallucinations are relatively inconsequential for individual users. The stakes for enterprises, however, are much higher.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best buy and hold stocks of the past decade. It has provided annualized returns of 29.35% over the past 10 years. Per the rule of 72, an investment in Microsoft would have doubled in value roughly every two and a half years during that time frame. And, $10,000 invested in MSFT shares and left untouched over that time would have grown to a value exceeding $131,000 today.\n\nIn short, the precedent for buying Microsoft and holding it over the long haul is sturdy.\n\nThe near future and long-term future for Microsoft will be heavily dependent upon artificial intelligence. in the near term, the markets will be looking for signs that Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform continues to grow due to AI. Customers continue to run and train their respective modelsUsing Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform. The AI Cloud platform, along with the data center opportunity overall, make Microsoft a clear long-term choice worth taking.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) An image of engineers analyzing wind turbines over the hill, data imposed over the image. NEE stock\n\nSource: ConceptCafe/Shutterstock\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is an extremely well-positioned stock overall, one that makes a lot of sense for the long term.\n\nThe company is part utilities firm and part renewable energy leader. It has a unique mix of revenue generation that truly sets it apart. It offers the growth of renewables with the steady nature of utilities stocks.\n\nThe utilities business makes NextEra Energy attractive when concerns about the tech sector arise, as they recently have. The defensive nature of utilities stocks is the reason for that truth. Also, NextEra Energy is attractive because the text sector is increasing renewable energy demand. The company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer expects renewable energy demand to triple by 2030. A lot of that growth will be driven by AI data center demand for clean energy. Those companies simultaneously reduce their carbon footprint while consuming more energy overall.\n\nNextEra Energy remains a uniquely positioned stock with multiple positive factors in its favor.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another long haul stock to buy for investors who believe in the power of AI and chips in general.\n\nThe Dutch firm is the only company in the world capable of producing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Those EUV machines are capable of producing the world\u2019s most advanced chips that drive innovation. That makes ASML, along with TSMC, linchpins of the technology sector.\n\nAnd, multiple signs show that ASML will continue to dominate. First, the company enjoys strong gross margins indicative of durable competitive advantage. That is one of many metrics which indicate that ASML is a highly profitable firm overall.\n\nThose powerful margins provide ASML with the cash necessary to invest in R&D that allows it to keep its competitive edge. The company invested four billion Euros in R&D in 2023, up from 3.3 billion in 2022. Also, it\u2019s front and center in relation to geopolitical tensions and has been for quite some time. Investors must consider ASML as among the best long haul tech stocks as chips drive innovation, and the company has an unassailable position in that regard.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Tesla is recalling over 1.8 million vehicles in the United States due to risk of software failure to detect an unlatched hood, the national auto safety regulator said on Tuesday.\n\nAn unlatched hood could fully open and obstruct the driver's view, raising the risk of a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.\n\nTesla has started rolling out an over-the-air software update to fix the issue, the NHTSA said. The updated software detects an open hood and alerts drivers of the situation.\n\nThe recall affects certain 2021-2024 Model 3, Model S, Model X, and 2020-2024 Model Y vehicles, the regulator said. The vehicles, Tesla said, were equipped with a hood latch produced in China by Magna Closures Co Ltd.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe company said it began investigating customer complaints of unprompted hood opening instances in certain Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China in March, and initiated a latch hardware recovery and in-service vehicle inspection.\n\nWhile fewer such events occurred in Europe and North America, Tesla said it began engineering studies in the regions to inspect hood latch assemblies last month and decided to issue a recall earlier this month.\n\nThe recall is Tesla's biggest since December when it had issued a recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its cars on U.S. roads at the time - to install new safeguards in its Autopilot system.\n\nHowever, following reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the new Autopilot update, the NHTSA has opened a probe, saying it had identified \"several concerns\" regarding the recall.\n\nTesla last week posted its worst quarterly profit margin in more than five years, underscoring the EV maker's struggle to revive auto sales amid a slowdown in demand.\n\n(Reporting by Disha Mishra and Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "Rivian Stock Outlook: Is RIVN Becoming More Promising as Tesla Stumbles?",
        "content": "I have long been skeptical about Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) as a company and Rivian stock.\n\nThe California-based automaker, with an assembly plant in Illinois, is going through an Electric Vehicle version of Death Valley. It needs to stay afloat long enough to build a new plant in Georgia, which it was forced to delay in March.\n\nThe plan is that the Georgia plant will, in 2027, deliver the R3. That\u2019s a smaller, less expensive EV that might be competitive with what China is putting out right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGetting from here to there looked like a stretch in March. But is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making it easier?\n\nThe Tesla Backlash The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings report was not good. Growth slowed and earnings were way down. It was clear to those who heard its conference call that CEO Elon Musk is focused on things other than building cars.\n\nAmerica is falling out of love with Tesla. Musk\u2019s behavior is being blamed. Personally, I think this is less with politics and Twitter than the Cybertruck, the Edsel of EVs.\n\nAll this has given Rivian a luster and an opportunity it didn\u2019t have before. Price targets are being raised on the heels of Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) putting $5 billion into a joint venture for its various innovations.\n\nThat\u2019s equity which, if properly leveraged along with $4.8 billion in current debt, could get Rivian to Georgia.\n\nGeorgia is what it\u2019s all about.\n\nGeorgia on my Mind Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian has 2,000 acres in Social Circle, Georgia, on which it agreed to build a new plant with state help in 2021. It\u2019s the biggest subsidy Gov. Brian Kemp has given any company. His political future is riding on it.\n\nAssuming Rivian can build the plant, it will be within a few hours of two huge battery plants, one in Commerce and one in Ellabell, \u00a0near Savannah. The U.S. Southeast is becoming a center of new battery technology, and batteries represent 40% of an EV\u2019s cost.\n\nRivian will deliver its second-quarter report on August 6, and analysts are hopeful. But Rivian is still a small company. It delivered just 13,790 vehicles during the second quarter.\n\nWhen Rivian reports its numbers, it will also tell analysts about the mix of its production and deliver some guidance for the rest of the year. The company is continuing to deliver on its order of 100,000 trucks for Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), originally placed five years ago. At last check 10,000 had been delivered, and the reviews I get from drivers are very good. Amazon recently dropped its exclusivity on the design.\n\nStory continues\n\nReviews on the latest versions of Rivian\u2019s R1 truck and SUV are positive. The second generation of its vehicles can go up to 420 miles on a charge, and they\u2019re simpler. They also use the same charging port as the Tesla, and can add 140 miles of range in just 30 minutes.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Rivian Stock The back of a silver Rivian (RIVN) pick-up truck.\n\nSource: Miro Vrlik Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Elon Musk is the Henry Ford of American EVs, Rivian founder R.J. Scaringe could become the Walter Chrysler. Chrysler became Ford\u2019s primary competitor in the 1920s, with its Touring Car outshining anything Ford delivered.\n\nScaringe is a respected car guy and will likely remain one. He convinced Amazon, Ford Motor (NYSE:F), the state of Georgia, and now Volkswagen to invest in him.\n\nRivian is delivering a good EV. While the company still hasn\u2019t gotten through the EV Death Valley and has yet to show a profit, it may have enough orders to do it. At its July 26 closing price, it\u2019s selling at barely three times sales, against more than seven times sales for Tesla.\n\nTesla\u2019s mistakes have made Rivian stock a worthwhile speculation.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN.

He also said the Model Y using FSD changed lanes during a stretch of the roadway where that is prohibited.\n\nMUSK SAYS TESLA'S MEXICO FACTORY ON PAUSE OVER TRUMP'S TARIFF PLEDGE Tesla's Full Self-Driving stipulates that it's supposed to be supervised by an attentive driver.\n\n\"Finally, in a section of our route, the highway was curvy and narrow, and had a solid white line separating lanes, signaling a prohibition against lane changes,\" he wrote. \"Still, the Model Y switched lanes twice under that condition.\"\n\nThe vehicle Stein drove was running FSD 12.3.6 in a \"demo mode\" that's only available to dealers during test drives and not Tesla owners.\n\nThe 12.3.6 version of FSD was released this spring. Musk announced on Monday that Tesla is pushing a new update to the feature with FSD 12.5.1 set to be released and told owners, \"Please connect your Tesla to WiFi to receive the update.\" He views FSD as a key part of Tesla's investment in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nStory continues\n\nTESLA'S CYBERTRUCK MAKING INROADS ON THE ROAD Tesla CEO Elon Musk views Full Self-Driving as Tesla's way of \"solving\" autonomous driving.\n\nStein concluded that while FSD was \"truly amazing\" it also was \"not even close to 'solving' autonomy\" as Musk has suggested FSD will eventually be able to do. He added that the test drive left him with questions about Tesla's upcoming Robotaxi event.\n\n\"Considering the gap between the [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] performance required to operate a driverless car (robotaxi) and the system's current performance, we remain befuddled at what Tesla might show at the Robotaxi event, which was recently delayed from August to October,\" Stein said. \"We remain hopeful and truly optimistic that improvements to FSD will lead to ever-safer and more useful autonomy features from Tesla over time.\"\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla notes in the owner's manual for its Model Y that drivers using FSD should, \"Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) does not make Model Y autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times.\"\n\nOriginal article source:Analyst had to intervene to keep Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode from crashing\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After 25 years of charitable giving, Melinda French Gates has cemented her reputation as a philanthropist, but she said some of her fellow billionaires aren\u2019t worthy of that title, despite what they say.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times Sunday, French Gates specifically commented on the charitable giving of billionaires like hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, Block CEO Jack Dorsey, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cThey use their voice and they use their megaphones, but I would not call those men philanthropists,\u201d French Gates said.\n\nDorsey did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent through Block.\n\nEven Ackman and Musk, who have signed the Giving Pledge promising to give away most of their assets, still have work to do, she said, and while each of the billionaires has his own foundation, French Gates said they \u201chave not been very philanthropic yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo look at their record of actually giving money to society. It\u2019s not big,\u201d she said.\n\nAckman did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to the Pershing Square Foundation. Musk did not reply to a request for comment sent to Tesla.\n\nThe billionaires, French Gates told the Times, also don\u2019t measure up to the impact that she and her ex-husband Bill Gates, along with Warren Buffett, have made through their decades of altruism.\n\n\u201cSo you put Bill and me and Warren in a class of philanthropists doing things in a certain way, but I don\u2019t think you can then say, \u2018OK, well, let\u2019s compare to this group over here who are nonphilanthropists.\u2019 Those are nonphilanthropists, in my opinion,\u201d she added.\n\nFrench Gates cofounded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, soon to be renamed the Gates Foundation, in 2000, and since then she and her now ex-husband have become the face of philanthropy worldwide. Before she announced in May she was leaving the foundation, she helped oversee more than $77 billion in grant payments to worthy causes over two decades, according to its website.\n\nFor their part, the billionaires French Gates called \u201cnonphilantropists\u201d have done plenty of giving in their own way, although some of their causes have been criticized.\n\nThiel and his foundation are most known for supporting science and entrepreneurship, including through the Thiel Fellowship, a two-year program that gives $100,000 to young people willing to delay or leave college \u201cto build new things.\u201d Some of the program\u2019s most successful alumni include Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the Ethereum blockchain, and Dylan Field, the founder of product design platform Figma.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Thiel Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, has donated at least $7.7 billion in Tesla shares to the Musk Foundation, yet some of his giving has been criticized as being self-serving. After a SpaceX rocket blew up and scattered debris near its launch site in Cameron County, Texas, Musk announced a $20 million donation to the county\u2019s school district and another $10 million to revitalize the nearby city of Brownsville, the Times reported.\n\nIn 2022, the last year for which full data on the Musk Foundation was available, it gave away only 2.25%, or about $157 million, of its $7 billion in assets, the Times found. About half of Musk\u2019s donations from 2021 and 2022 were linked to his employees, his businesses, or himself in some way, according to the Times.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Will the Next Batch of Tech Earnings Encourage Investors to Rotate Back In?",
        "content": "Another chance for mega tech to impress investors\n\nThis week the megacaps get another chance to prove themselves when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (AAPL?) all report second-quarter earnings.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) got the reporting party started on Tuesday after-the-bell to little fanfare. Disappointing results from both those names led to a general selloff on Wednesday, which saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite clocking their worst performance since 2022. Weakness was obvious in Tesla's results, which missed earnings per share expectations by 9 cents and saw auto revenue slip 7% year over year.[1] On the other hand, Alphabet handily beat expectations on both the top and bottom line, but it was worse-than-expected YouTube advertising revenue that caused investors to punish the stock.[2] Alphabet shares took another leg lower on Thursday when OpenAI announced the prototype of its search engine, SearchGPT. As a result of these early earnings results, other mega-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta and Apple fell in sympathy.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MCD.\n\nThe markets climbed their way out of the trenches late last week, boosted by a better-than-expected gross domestic product report which saw the U.S. economy expanding by 2.80% [3] and the June Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI) that showed inflation continuing to ease.[4] Despite that, many tech names ended the week lower, with Meta, Microsoft and Apple down approximately 2% for the week, Nvidia falling 3% and Alphabet down nearly 6%.\n\nThe bar was set high coming into the second-quarter season with little room for error for corporations releasing results. Despite the recent rotation out of tech, many of these names still have very rich valuations and investors want to see they are justified by strong fundamentals. Thus far, the trend of investors rewarding positive surprises less than usual and punishing negative surprises more than usual remains in play.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 EPS growth is for 9.80% year over year, an increase from 9.70% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 60% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nSecond peak week\n\nThis week marks the second peak week of the second-quarter earnings season with nearly 2,500 companies anticipated to release results. All eyes will be on mega tech once again, as Microsoft reports on Tuesday, Meta on Wednesday and Apple and Amazon on Thursday, all after the close.?\n\nStory continues Will the Next Batch of Tech Earnings Encourage Investors to Rotate Back In?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[7]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Ten companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, eight of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are F5 Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corp. (NYSE:IEX), Meta Platforms, Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The two names with positive DateBreaks Factors are ANSYS Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) and Smurfit WestRock PLC (NYSE:SW).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nMcDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday July 29, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nMcDonald's Corp is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, July 29. While this is only two days later than they reported last year, it would be the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter.\n\nMcDonald's rang the alarm on the U.S. consumer last quarter after disappointing earnings per share results pointed to a pull-back in discretionary spending. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they faced elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the industry, CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's first-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Wednesday July 31, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nBoeing is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Wednesday, July 29, the latest they've ever reported for the second quarter, but still sticking with their Wednesday reporting trend.\n\nAfter all of the setbacks and bad press Boeing has received this year, it probably isn't particularly surprising to see them move their earnings date later. On Wednesday the planemaker plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge for misleading U.S. regulators in order to get the 737 Max jetliner approved before it was ready, leading to two fatal crashes.[8] It isn't just the issue with the 737 Max jetliners, but other models such as 777 freighters that are incomplete and awaiting additional parts or updated software, costing the company about $1 billion a month as they scramble to get these idle planes up and running.[9]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 9, with each week expected to see over nearly 2,000-plus reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,438 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 69% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.?

        "title": "Good News! Option Traders Signal Potential Turnaround for Lucid Stock.",
        "content": "Electric vehicles represented so much promise but recently the sector has struggled. Just look at premium manufacturer Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID). Financially supported by huge backers and enjoying some positive notoriety as a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) alternative, the upstart arrived on the scene with much fanfare. Unfortunately, investors aren\u2019t all that excited about Lucid stock.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, LCID incurred a loss of roughly 19%. Over the past 52 weeks, the equity suffered a massive hit nearing 55%. On a financial note, sales growth stalled in 2023. Naturally, the company is losing money every year in a capital-intensive industry. Circumstances hardly seem rosy.\n\nAt the same time, it might be too early to give up on LCID stock. In July, the equity appeared to have arrested its downward trajectory. Although there are plenty of reasons to be bearish against Lucid, it has some key factors moving in its favor. From a speculative point of view, it may be worthwhile to throw some pocket change at it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFundamentals Are Supportive of Lucid Stock\n\nWithin the broader EV space, it was Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) \u2013 not Lucid stock \u2013 that grabbed business headlines recently. Not too long ago, Rivian inked a deal with German automotive giant Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). As InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer mentioned, the reason for the partnership centered on Volkswagen looking to improve its EV software and architecture.\n\nWith the funds coming in, Rivian should be better positioned to introduce its upcoming R2 and R3 vehicles. Both are much more modestly priced and therefore target the middle-income crowd. The former model will be priced at $45,000 while the latter may come in around $37,000. Seemingly, this directive should benefit RIVN while Lucid stock languishes.\n\nI have a contrarian view on this because beneath this directive is a tacit admission: Rivian is struggling to generate momentum in the premium, upper-tier segment of the EV market. Otherwise, if the company was enjoying robust success in the stratosphere, it would be imprudent to come near terrestrial levels. Why cheapen and dilute a desirable luxury brand?\n\nIn my opinion, Rivian needs to target the middle-income segment more out of necessity. But focusing on this consumer group opens new challenges. The lower the income level, the likelier it is that drivers are actually using the car; for example, commuting, getting groceries, running other errands. It\u2019s not like a $200,000 Corvette, a toy for the affluent.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy marketing to average-income households, Rivian will now be competing against legacy automakers transitioning to the EV sector. That might \u201cfree up\u201d space in the premium EV segment, which might benefit Lucid stock.\n\nOptions Traders Bid Up LCID\n\nAnother factor to consider regarding LCID stock is the derivatives market. Based on Friday\u2019s market session, it appears that options traders are betting on the EV manufacturer swinging higher.\n\nAccording to Barchart\u2019s options flow screener \u2013 which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional or professional investors \u2013 the net trade sentiment for Lucid stock derivatives clocked in at $66,000, favoring the bulls. Overall, options with positive sentiment (bought calls, sold puts) saw total premiums land at $111,900. Options with negative sentiment (sold calls, bought puts) sat at $45,900 below zero.\n\nSome of the individual bullish options \u2013 such as the sale of 2024 Nov. 15 $3.50 puts \u2013 were intriguing. In this case, traders appear to be betting that LCID stock will rise to $3.50 or beyond by Nov. 15. If that happens, the put sellers (or writers) will be able to collect maximum premiums. But is such optimism justified? From TradingView.com\n\nCharts by TradingView\n\nBased on the technical dynamics, the answer appears to be \u201cyes.\u201d Since late November 2021, Lucid stock has been falling along a negative trend line. Prior efforts by the bulls to break above this level have failed. However, this month, LCID jumped above its 200-day moving average. This move appears to be signaling a break away from the aforementioned negative trajectory.\n\nStill, given the severe downside, Lucid stock has much to prove. Over the next few weeks, it\u2019s important for the equity to not fall below $3. By late September, LCID\u2019s floor must be near $3.50. Otherwise, if the stock falls below these key levels, the bearish cycle may resume again.\n\nThe Takeaway: Both Fundamentals and Technicals Smile on Lucid\n\nAlthough the EV sector has been a challenging one for its competitors, Lucid stock may have an opportunity to rise above the muck. For one thing, the underlying company is still purely focused on addressing the upper-income crowd. Other companies have started to back off from this niche but profitable segment to target the middle-income consumer. Second, options traders \u2013 essentially the smart money \u2013 see opportunity in LCID. Looking at the technicals, the enthusiasm appears justified.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "The overall stock market has been reeling over the last week or so. The S&P 500 index and NASDAQ have fallen by 4% and 6%, respectively, since July 16 due to uncertainty regarding the future of artificial intelligence. This has caused major tech sell-offs among oversold giants such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Investors are also buying into small and mid-cap stocks in hopes of gains following interest rate cuts expected this year.\n\nEven though many investors seek out large-cap stocks with high trading volume, specifically within the tech sector, many other industries are experiencing an inflow of investments. It is important for investors not to overreact and make rushed decisions in a market downturn.\n\nMany companies are still performing well, and investors are excited about their future. Of the stocks with 52-week highs during this dip in the stock market, three are well-known by investors and offer substantial upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) is a life science service company that offers specialty laboratory and diagnostics equipment for industries such as pharmaceuticals, genetic sciences, agriculture and government.\n\nOver the past fifty-two weeks, its share price has risen by 6%.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk has said during Tesla Inc.\u2019s last two earnings calls that investors won\u2019t understand the company unless they\u2019re using the driver-assistance system marketed as Full Self-Driving.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Opposition Disputes Claim of Maduro Election Victory Harris\u2019 Running-Mate Search Zeroes In on Three Top Contenders Traders Fret as 32-Hour Central Bank Spree Hangs Over Market French Internet Lines Cut in Latest Attack During Olympics Apple's AI Features Rollout Will Miss Upcoming iPhone Software Overhaul\n\nWilliam Stein, a Truist Securities analyst with a hold rating on Tesla\u2019s stock, took this as his cue to test-drive one of the carmaker\u2019s vehicles, and narrowly avoided a crash.\n\n\u201cThe Model Y accelerated through an intersection as the car in front of us had only partly completed a right turn,\u201d Stein wrote in a report to clients Monday. \u201cMy quick intervention was absolutely required to avoid an otherwise certain accident.\u201d\n\nStein, who maintained his rating and $215 price target, emerged from the experience \u201cbefuddled at what Tesla might show\u201d at an unveiling of robotaxi prototypes in October. Musk said last week that the company decided to delay the event by about two months, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Stein\u2019s report. Musk posted Monday on X that the carmaker is deploying an updated version of Full Self-Driving, or FSD, which doesn\u2019t make the company\u2019s vehicles autonomous.\n\nMusk has placed greater emphasis on FSD and Tesla\u2019s broader artificial intelligence efforts as sales of its electric vehicles have slowed. The chief executive officer\u2019s messaging has helped support a stock that had sunk more than 40% for the year as of mid-April. The shares were down 12% as of last week\u2019s close and climbed Monday after Morgan Stanley designated Tesla its new top pick among US auto stocks.\n\nStein gave FSD a try earlier in April, following Tesla\u2019s first-quarter earnings call, and again this month. He wrote up a mixed review the first time around \u2014 \u201cstunningly good, but not useful today\u201d \u2014 and summed up the second test run as \u201cno better, arguably worse.\u201d\n\nBoth of Stein\u2019s drives were around New York suburbs in clear and dry conditions. He was impressed during his latest test how well FSD adapted to lane closures, potholes and traffic flows, and said the driving \u201cfelt more natural overall\u201d than the prior trial.\n\nWhat was surprising and went poorly, he said, was the system\u2019s permissiveness \u2014 he was no longer required to tug on the steering wheel to keep FSD engaged, and was able to continue using it even while taking his eyes off the road.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI turned my head completely away from the road,\u201d Stein wrote, adding that his son kept a lookout for any danger. \u201cThe system continued for 20-40 seconds before issuing a warning.\u201d\n\nIn addition to intervening to avoid rear-ending a car that only partly completed a right turn, Stein said another intervention was required when a police officer used hand motions to signal he needed to pull to the side of the road for a funeral procession to pass.\n\n\u201cFinally, in a section of our route, the highway was curvy and narrow, and had a solid white line separating lanes, signaling a prohibition against lane changes,\u201d Stein wrote. \u201cStill, the Model Y switched lanes twice under that condition.\u201d\n\nStein concluded that the version of FSD he tested was \u201ctruly amazing, but not even close to \u2018solving\u2019 autonomy,\u201d alluding to language Musk has repeatedly used.\n\n(Updates with Musk\u2019s X post in the fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship The Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made significant advancements with the introduction of Full Self-Driving (FSD) v12.5, according to analysts at Ark Invest.\n\nLast week, Tesla rolled out this new version to a select group of customer vehicles, featuring a hands-free driving system powered by its latest Hardware 4 (HW4) inference chip, produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\n\nThis update, which boasts a fivefold increase in the parameter count compared to previous models, offers a dramatic enhancement in performance. Users have reported smooth, uninterrupted, and confident AI-controlled drives lasting 45 minutes or longer.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fGet the latest news for your favorite companies with InvestingPro! use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nArk's research indicates that the upcoming update, FSD v12.5.X, is set to bring even more substantial improvements. It will combine the highway and city driving software into a single, end-to-end solution.\n\nTesla aims to reduce the intervention rate\u2014the frequency at which drivers need to manually take control\u2014before officially launching its robotaxi network.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s earnings call, Elon Musk emphasized Tesla's strategy to globalize its autonomous driving technology. The company plans to seek regulatory approval to deploy FSD in regions such as Europe, China, and other countries.\n\nMusk expressed confidence that full autonomy could be achieved by late 2024, with a high probability by 2025. Concurrently, Ark's updated valuation model for Tesla anticipates that 2025 will most likely be the year when Tesla launches its robotaxi service.\n\nHowever, their conservative estimates suggest a roughly 40% chance of this milestone slipping into 2026. Ark remains keen on monitoring FSD\u2019s progression towards full autonomy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla advances FSD to v12.5 with major update, aims for full autonomy by 2025\n\nCushman & Wakefield shares dip after posting 5% decline in revenue YoY, despite Q2 beat\n\nS&P 500 barely rises as investors await key results, jobs data, Fed meeting\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) -Tesla shares jumped nearly 6.3% on Monday after Morgan Stanley named the most valuable automaker its \"top pick\" in the U.S. automotive industry, replacing Ford.\n\nThe brokerage said Tesla's energy business could potentially grow to be worth more than the company's auto business in the future, as investors were likely to focus on firms that address climate change-related issues.\n\nIt also expects Tesla to take a more dominant position in the market for zero-emission vehicle credit revenue - for which it recognized around $2,000 per unit in the second quarter - as legacy automakers pull back on their EV expansion plans.\n\n\"We estimate Tesla may account for as much as half the credit sales in the market, supporting a 100% margin business for Tesla that may not be anticipated by the investment community at this time,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTesla, however, reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years last week and missed Wall Street earnings targets for the second quarter, as the Elon Musk-led firm heavily discounted its vehicles to counter sagging demand.\n\nThe brokerage flagged concerns over Tesla's ability to commercialize autonomous driving technology in China and the future of EV demand.\n\nTesla has been betting on its autonomous driving technology, which has come under regulatory scrutiny over safety concerns.\n\nInvestors are keenly awaiting Tesla's robotaxi launch event, which it had delayed to October from August to rework some elements of the car.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford dropped nearly 2% on Monday, following a 20% slump last week after the automaker reported second-quarter profit below estimates, as it struggles with quality-related costs and stiff competition in its EV business.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "title": "Costco Is Beyond Overvalued",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST) has been an investing darling for as long as I can remember. It has also been a darling for shoppers as they have some of the strongest brand loyalty in the market. I know firsthand as I am a card-carrying member of its club and happily pay the membership fee every year to shop in its warehouses. No one can beat its rotisserie chickens, toilet paper and giant box of spinach.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with COST.\n\nThis is not a shopping blog, so let's jump into the company and stock. Costco has been performing wonderfully over the last 12 months, especially compared to its peers. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocusIts GF Score is also very high at 90 out of 100. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nLet's dive in to figure out what is driving this performance.\n\nEPS growth is outpacing competition\n\nCostco's three-year growth rate of earnings per share without nonrecurring items was over 16%, which is better than most companies in its sector and the best in its peer group. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWhat has been driving this growth? I will examine revenue and then costs to figure out what is happening.\n\nRevenue grew post-pandemic\n\nCostco views itself as a single segment company, but it does break out revenue into something called Core Merchandise Categories. Here are those categories:\n\nFood and Sundries - These include sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor and tobacco. Fresh Foods - This includes meat, produce, service deli and bakery items. Warehouse Ancillary and Other Businesses - This includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, tires, business centers and travel. Membership Fees - Fees that members pay to gain access to Costco warehouses. Non-Foods - This is everything else that includes things like appliances, electronics, sporting goods, toys, apparel, furniture, housewares and jewelry (and much more).\n\nBelow is a chart showing the sales growth in each of these categories going back the last few years. Please note that the fourth quarter (quarter ending in August) is longer than the other quarters, which is why there is a jump. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThe growth is positive but has been declining slightly each quarter. The only exception was in the Warehouse Ancillary and Other Businesses Segment, where the growth rate plummeted from highs in 2022 (this is not in the chart to make it more readable for the other segments). This was largely due to increased travel in 2022 compared to 2021 as Covid-19 travel restrictions were lifted worldwide.\n\nIs Costco growing by adding warehouses or by increasing revenue in its existing locations? The chart below shows that most of the revenue growth is from existing warehouses rather than opening new locations.\n\nStory continues Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThis is great as it shows Costco is able to grow organically. However, sales, while still positive, are growing less than a few years ago. Analysts are expecting positive sales growth going forward. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocus\n\nHowever, they also expect growth to be slightly above 5%, which continues the worrying trend of a declining growth rate.\n\nCosts are steadily rising with revenue\n\nCostco breaks up its operating costs into merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative. Merchandise costs are the costs associated with purchasing the products that are sold in its warehouses. Selling, general and administrative are the costs associated with running the warehouses, such as salaries and benefits paid to employees, marketing expenses or utilities.\n\nOver the last few years, the operating expense as a percentage of sales has been very stable. Merchandise expenses hover around 87% of revenue while SG&A is between 8% and 9%.\n\nOperating income is increasing, but volatile\n\nGrowing revenue with a commensurate increase in costs will lead to an increase in operating income, which Costco has done the last few years. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nHowever, revenue growing at differing rates each quarter has led to operating income growth being all over the place. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I would certainly prefer volatile positive growth over stable negative growth. Even with the volatility, Costco has led its peer group in Ebitda growth over the last few years. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nROE is one of the highest in the industry\n\nCostco's return on equity is one of the major selling points for investors Currently, it is higher than almost 90% of other companies in the industry and 3 times higher than the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nUsing the five-step Dupont analysis can provide more information on why the company's ROE is so high. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCostco's net margin is low at just shy of 3%. However, retail is an industry with really tight margins, so it is actually better than the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWe do not have an industry-level equity multiplier, but we can use the equity-to-asset ratio as a proxy since that is just the inverse of the equity multiplier. Here, Costco is a little behind the industry median, but it is not so far off to be a cause for concern. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nWhere Costco really stands out is asset turnover. Compared to its peers, the retailer is way ahead of everyone else with an asset turnover that is 20% higher than second place, BJ's Wholesale (NYSE:BJ). Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThis all sounds great, so what is the problem?\n\nValuation ratios are at all-time highs\n\nCostco's valuation ratios are screaming overvalued at the moment. Just pick one out of a hat, throw it in a chart and you will see it is near anall-time high. Below is a chart showing the price-earnings ratio and it is not pretty. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nCOST Data by GuruFocus\n\nCompared to its peers, Costco's price-earnings ratio is significantly higher at 3 times the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nThe PEG ratio, which incorporates expected growth, is not any better, and is also 3 times the industry median. Costco Is Beyond Overvalued\n\nTo put all of this into perspective, Costco's current price-earnings ratio is higher than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has a similar price-earnings ratio to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Costco is great, but its growth prospects are not even close to these other companies.\n\nThe company's price-earnings ratio over the last 10 years has averaged around 33. Costco's management does not issue guidance, so I will use analyst estimates instead. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $16.24 for fiscal year 2025. Multipling 33 by that EPS gives a target price of $535, which is significantly below current price levels.Time to take some profits\n\nCostco's growth has been impressive. Throw in an industry-leading ROE with incredible brand loyalty and the company looks like a slam dunk for investors.\n\nHowever, the price movement has gone a little crazy the last couple of years and valuation ratios are way too high. If I was looking to invest in Costco, I would sit on the sidelines and wait for the price to come back down to Earth. If you already are a Costco investor, it probably makes sense to sell some shares and lock in those profits.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned +11.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has gained 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share, indicating a change of -10.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.3%. This estimate has changed -4.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.14 indicates a change of +36.3% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.67 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $98.83 billion and $113.33 billion estimates indicate +2.1% and +14.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTesla reported revenues of $25.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $0.91 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.48%. The EPS surprise was -16.13%.\n\nThe company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street offered a mixed performance last week, with the S&P 500 losing 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 0.8%. The Nasdaq was off 2.1% last week. The Russell 2000 has advanced 3.5% last week. The tech slump weighed on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.\n\nWall Street\u2019s tech crash last week was mainly driven by Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL earnings report, which highlighted increased capital expenses. Tesla Inc.\u2019s TSLA stock also suffered following its earnings results due to a lack of details from CEO Elon Musk on the company's self-driving vehicle efforts.\n\nMany feared that the huge AI investments made by big tech companies would pay off later than expected. The scale of profitability of those investments is also unknown now, while the high valuation of AI stocks became a concern for many investors (read: Time for Covered Call ETFs?).\n\nInside Q2 U.S. GDP Data\n\nAnother key event last week was the release of the Q2 GDP growth data for the U.S. economy, which expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in the second quarter of 2024. The advance estimate of second-quarter U.S. GDP revealed that the economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% in Q2, well above the 2% growth expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The reading came in higher than the first-quarter GDP, which was revised down to 1.4% (read: Small-Cap ETFs to Rally on Upbeat U.S. Q2 GDP Growth Data?).\n\nEther ETFs Receive Final Approval From SEC\n\nETFs holding ether (ETH) officially started to trade in the United States on Jul 23, 2024, following the final approval from regulators on Jul 22, 2024. This put the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency in an investment vehicle favored by many professional investors and advisors.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved BlackRock BLK, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale and 21 Shares, as announced by the companies (read: Ether ETFs Receive Final Approval From SEC).\n\nBiden\u2019s Exit From Presidential Race\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his presidential campaign on Jul 21, 2024. His departure was probably prompted by concerns from party officials about his ability to serve a second term at the age of 81. However, he plans to complete the remaining three months of his term.\n\nBiden also announced his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president. However, it doesn\u2019t ensure that she will automatically get the nomination (read: AI Stocks & ETFs to Rally on Likely Harris Trade?)\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning ETFs of last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nRange Cancer Therapeutics ETF CNCR \u2013 Up 9%\n\nBiotech stocks have likely surged due to the anticipated Fed rate cuts and the prospects of lower interest rates ahead. Plus, the space has been thriving with innovations and FDA approvals. The top holding of the fund \u2014 Geron (GERN) \u2014 won the FDA approval for its blood cancer drug.\n\nYieldMax Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF CRSH \u2013 Up 8.9%\n\nTesla posted mixed second-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. The stock suffered last week and boosted the option income strategy ETF based on Tesla.\n\nIn this strategy, instead of buying options (which gives the right to buy or sell an asset at a certain price), you sell options contracts. When you sell options, you receive a premium upfront from the buyer of the option. The income-oriented fund yields 11.44% annually.\n\nETRACS Whitney U.S. Critical Technologies ETN WUCT \u2013 Up 7.8%\n\nThe underlying Solactive Whitney U.S. Critical Technologies CNTR Index is market-capitalization weighted, subject to caps on individual companies and designed to track large and mid-cap companies in developed markets that are associated with critical technology sectors and that meet a minimum geopolitical risk-rating score.\n\nARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG \u2013 Up 7.3%\n\nThe fund\u2019s top holding that takes 10% of the fund \u2014 Twist Bioscience Corp TWST \u2014 gained 6.2% last week. The second holding that takes about 7% of the fund \u2014 Crispr Therapeutics CRSP \u2014 added about 5% last week. In short, the air is currently in favor of biotech investing.\n\nProcure Space ETF UFO \u2013 Up 7%\n\nThe space economy is witnessing frequent groundbreaking advancements worldwide. Maintaining an impressive annual growth rate of 9% and outpacing global GDP expansion, the space economy is projected to surge to $1.8 trillion by 2035 from $630 billion in 2023, according to a McKinsey report (read: $1.8T Space Boom Expected by 2035: ETFs to Play).\n\nFirst Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund QABA \u2013 Up 6.3%\n\nAs the Fed is likely to cut rates in September, the yield curve has steepened and benefitted bank stocks as these increase banks\u2019 net interest rate margin.

        "title": "RIVN Stock Analysis: Can Rivian Keep Its Turnaround Hopes Alive?",
        "content": "Not many electric vehicle (EV) stocks have thrived in the current market downturn, but Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is bucking the trend. The EV upstart has seen multiple positive developments, pushing its stock price into high gear. However, despite Rivian stock surging by 94% in the past three months, several factors fuel skepticism over its long-term bull case. The flip side to that story is also somewhat compelling, making it best to hold Rivian stock now.\n\nRivian was one of the many EV startups that went public amid the EV-SPAC frenzy during the pandemic years. A few days after going public in early November 2021, we saw its stock jump to an all-time high of $172.01. Since then, it has been nothing short of a horror show for its initial investors, shedding 90% from its peak value.\n\nThe past few years were eventful, though, with its cars finally hitting the roads, facing production challenges while grappling with major cash flow issues last year. However, since then, we\u2019ve seen its top-level management looking to build its brand, improve delivery volumes, and introduce new, cost-effective EV models.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNevertheless, the firm\u2019s still burning through a ton of cash, and given the uncertainties in its growth story, it\u2019s tough to fully commit to it at this point.\n\nFresh Designs and Cost-Savings May Tip the Scales An all electric Rivian (RIVN) R1T pickup truck driving through the American soutwest desert on the I-10 freeway towards Tucson.\n\nSource: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Rivian stock turnaround started in March when the EV maker unveiled plans for new, affordable models. Additionally, its CEO, RJ Scaringe, also announced a strategic pullback on constructing its Georgia plant, potentially resulting in $2.25 billion in savings.\n\nLimited cost-effective options have plagued the EV space, but Rivian\u2019s recent introduction of three new affordable models could be a game-changer. These include the R2 SUV starting at $45,000 and two crossovers in the R3 and the R3X.\n\nThe R2 SUV is a sleeker, more budget-friendly alternative to the company\u2019s pricier R1 models. Despite the slightly higher price point than other SUVs in this range, the R2 offers multiple stand-out features that justify the bump. It operates on a brand-new EV platform with a revamped battery setup, supporting a robust tri-motor system that can get up from 0 to 60 mph in less than three seconds.\n\nFurthermore, the R2 is the first of Rivian\u2019s line-up to efficiently integrate with Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) powerful Supercharger network and other NACS stations. Perhaps its biggest USP is that the R2 is developed with level 3 autonomy capabilities, unlike any other SUVs in this range.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s a savvy move on Rivian\u2019s part to leverage the productive potential of its Illinois facility instead of developing its Georgia plant. $2.25 billion in savings is massive, especially considering it forms over 28% of the $7.9 billion in its cash reserve.\n\nFinancial Strains and Key Partnerships in Focus Early production Rivian (RIVN) R1T at the Normal, IL production plant\n\nSource: Frank Briend / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst for Rivian stock was automobile giant Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) announcing plans to invest $5 billion in its business. The cash infusion is part of a partnership that will grant Volkswagen access to Rivian\u2019s electrical architectures and software.\n\nConsequently, we\u2019ve seen Rivian stock surge north of 57% in the past month. \u00a0The announcement was soon followed up by Rivian\u2019s management, reaffirming its full-year production guidance and that it would likely generate positive gross profit in the fourth quarter (Q4).\n\nThese developments were more than welcome by Rivian, particularly the much-needed cash injection. Over the past couple of years, the firm has burned through roughly $12 billion to scale its business. Clearly, with just $7.9 billion in cash, it needs a lot of funding to push on from here.\n\nUnfortunately, the expansion has and will continue to be mostly at the expense of its shareholders. Outstanding shares rose from 204 million in 2021 to 995.3 million in 2024, a staggering 388% increase. Additionally, the 1-year long-term change in its debt load stands at a worrying 63%.\n\nHence, Rivian is in a precarious spot financially, and the massive investment from Volkswagen should help steady the ship. However, it must sustain strong demand for its vehicles in the coming quarters to maintain momentum. The R2 and its other budget-friendly models will be crucial in achieving this, but they won\u2019t scale significantly until 2027. Therefore, partnerships like the one with Volkswagen will be incredibly important as it continues to burn through a boatload of cash each quarter.\n\nFinal Word On Rivian Stock Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian looks much better in shape than last year and is on the back of multiple positive developments. In some ways, this has inspired investor confidence again, pushing the stock back into the limelight. On top of this, it has numerous growth catalysts that could transform its trajectory over the next few years.\n\nHowever, its cash burn is a major worry, and it could play spoilsport again if it isn\u2019t managed effectively. That\u2019s because for the early days of a technology-heavy company like Rivian, cash, and the necessary capital to expand research and development are key to winning new customers and creating a product that sells well.\n\nAs a result, Rivian remains a \u2018show-me\u2019 story, worth monitoring closely before making a long-term investment. Right now, the signs seem to be pointing toward a stable and realistic future for the company, but that isn\u2019t guaranteed considering the broader challenges the general EV market currently faces.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "Sandy Garossino, the mother of Grimes, said in a series of unconfirmed social-media posts Saturday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is \"withholding\" their children and didn't let them visit their ailing great-grandmother.\n\nMusk and Grimes have been in a custody battle involving their three children. Representatives for Musk, Grimes and Garossino didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. For now, the details of the situation come from Garossino.\n\nWriting on X, she said she had no other way to reach Musk other than posting on his platform, noting that her 93-year-old mother is at end-of-life care and wants to see her great-grandchildren one last time.\n\nTo celebrate their great-grandmother's birthday, the kids were supposed to visit her in Canada this weekend, but the trip was canceled, Garossino added.\n\n\"I am alarmed to learn that the children cannot come as you are withholding them and their needed passport documents from Claire,\" she wrote, referring to Grimes' given name. \"It was even more troubling to see you and X on television at the Olympics in Paris yesterday, after your DC trip earlier in the week.\"\n\nGarossino also asked Musk to \"honour your agreement, return the children, and provide the documents they need to see their great grandmother before she passes.\"\n\nShe concluded her message by saying, \"Please Elon, I beg you. This is so painful for my mother, and concerning for the kids. Time is of the essence now.\"\n\nIn addition to his three children with Grimes, Musk has nine other kids with other women, including ex-wife Justine Wilson and Shivon Zilis.\n\nHis estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson highlighted Garossino's plea on her Threads account and blasted Musk for \"keeping their children, her children, away from their mother during the most important developmental period in a child\u2019s life.\"\n\nDays earlier, Wilson, who is transgender, described the billionaire as a cruel absentee parent in an interview with NBC News after her father said she was \u201ckilled by the woke mind virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was there, I want to say, maybe 10% of the time. That\u2019s generous,\u201d she said, adding that during these periods, he\u2019d pressure her to appear more masculine.\n\n\u201cI was in fourth grade. We went on this road trip that I didn\u2019t know was actually just an advertisement for one of the cars\u2014I don\u2019t remember which one\u2014and he was constantly yelling at me viciously because my voice was too high,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt was cruel.\u201d\n\nAfter the interview, Grimes offered support for Wilson, tweeting on Thursday that \"I love and am forever endlessly proud of Vivian.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla and BYD Are Dominating the Global Electric Vehicle Market",
        "content": "In the second quarter of 2024, Tesla's gross margin dropped to a new low after declining every quarter since Q1 2022. Thanks to an uptick in deliveries over the past months, the U.S. automaker and pioneer of getting battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to the mass market still retained the biggest market share among all BEVs sold worldwide.\n\nIn the past year and the first three months of 2024, Tesla's share was constant at 19 percent, according to analyses by EV Volumes and Inside EVs for the corresponding periods.\n\nThe competition, however, is hot on its heels.\n\nAs Statista;s Florian Zandt shows in the chart below, the Chinese conglomerate, which produces standalone electric vehicle batteries and associated electronics in addition to plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, increased its market share by ten percentage points between 2021 and 2023. The BEV portfolio of legacy automakers like Volkswagen and Geely-Volvo stood at seven percent, on par with SAIC, which includes the joint venture between the Chinese state-owned SAIC Motor and Wuling as well as General Motors.\n\nWhile the first quarter saw BYD's share drop by two points, it was only 18,000 cars shy of Tesla's deliveries between April and June 2024, illustrating how close the head-to-head race between these two companies is.\n\nBYD is focused on providing BEVs to a more general consumer base, while Tesla's products have a higher price tag.\n\nThis difference might be slightly mitigated through the increase of tariffs on Chinese-made cars from 25 to 100 percent announced in May and coming into effect in early August, a move that simultaneously seeks to boost domestic sales and will likely increase tensions between the People's Republic and the United States.\n\nAccording to EV Volumes, 14 million electric vehicles were sold globally in 2023, 70 percent of which were BEVs. However, 84 percent of all light vehicles sold still ran on traditional combustion engines or other non-electric fuel sources.\n\nThe biggest exporter and market for both hybrids and BEVs was China with shares of 65 and 59 percent, respectively.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nAfrican Countries Shift to Gold As Dollar Doubts Grow UK Carmakers Retool Production Lines for Electric Vehicles Why Financial Demand Can't Solve Our Resource Problems\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The tech rout is far from over.\n\nThat\u2019s the warning from strategists this week as investors dump big tech stocks in favor of previously unloved areas of the market. The Nasdaq 100 closed the week down 2.7%, marking the third week in a row of declines, with the technology sector suffering its largest single-day percentage drop since October 2022.\n\nThe culprits: bets on Fed rate cuts, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) lackluster earnings, and fears about Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) AI spending ramp.\n\n\u201cValuations were priced to perfection from an earnings standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint, that eventually we would see some sort of a valuation correction,\u201d Verdence Capital Advisors chief investment officer Megan Horneman told me.\n\nHorneman, who warned the AI trade is \u201chitting a wall,\u201d added that this week\u2019s rotation out of big tech is only the start of a \u201cvaluation correction.\u201d\n\nThe significant shift under way has pushed small caps to the top of investors' buying lists. The Russell 2000 (RUT) recorded weekly gains for the third week in a row, marking its best three week stretch since 2022. Data compiled by Bespoke found that the outperformance spread between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) over the last 12 trading days, in favor of the small-cap index, is the second most extreme in the history of the two indices.\n\n\u201cWith multiples as high as they are for the Mag seven, they're building in earnings growth. And if you don't see that earnings growth, that means that valuations come into question,\u201d Commonwealth Financial Network\u2019s Brad McMillan explained to me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a threat of more pressure ahead,\u201d McMillan said.\n\nAnd that risk of slower profit growth, coupled with increased spending on AI, could signal that the \u201cepic momentum reversal\u201d will persist, unless big tech raises forward revenue guidance, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note to clients, Goldman Sachs\u2019 David Kostin wrote investors are starting to worry about the prospect of \u201coverinvestment\u201d in AI without timely proven returns, noting that Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet are driving the bulk of the spending.\n\n\u201cConsensus estimates of 2024 and 2025 capex and R&D spending by the hyperscalers have increased by $65 billion compared with expectations at the start of the year. However, analysts have lifted their sales forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by only $36 billion \u2014 a gap of nearly $30 billion,\u201d Kostin wrote.\n\n\u201cThese firms during the past six months have dramatically increased their planned spending on AI initiatives but it is not apparent when the return will come \u2014 in 2027, 2028, 2029, or perhaps not at all,\u201d he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs our markets reporter Josh Schafer noted, two charts in Yahoo Finance\u2019s Chartbook suggest further selling ahead. Analysis by Truist\u2019s Keith Lerner found that the S&P 500 sees an average correction of about 9% in the second half of the year, after the index rallies more than 10% in the first six months.\n\nMeanwhile, BMO Capital Markets chief investment officer Brian Belski\u2019s review of past performance found that stocks usually drop an average of 9.4% in the second year of a cyclical bull market, which started in October 2022.\n\n\u201cThis market has become quite frothy with everybody looking to big cap tech stocks and chasing the market,\u201d Belski told me. \u201cIt's really difficult to be overweight Apple or overweight Nvidia \u2026 especially given how much they've rallied.\u201d\n\nSafe to say, earnings results this coming week from Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft will be a crucial measuring stick. Any sort of disappointment, similar to what we saw from Alphabet and Tesla this week, could trigger more carnage for the tech market.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Here's what top leaders are telling us about the state of the world and stocks",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nBeing a top-tier journalist isn't for everyone.\n\nI was reminded of this while chatting with seven-time Gerald Loeb award winner (the highest honor bestowed upon a business journalist), Allan Sloan, on my Opening Bid podcast this week. Sloan \u2014 who has been doing this crazy gig for more than 50 years \u2014 was recalling intense phone chats he had with then-NYC real estate developer Donald J. Trump.\n\nOther tales he spun include tough questions he posed to bombastic CEOs, and digging into companies to reveal a true picture for investors.\n\nListening to Sloan reaffirmed to me why (or partly why) I approach everything I do in this field with a sense it may all be taken away tomorrow. At the same time, the conversation was another proof point that if you want to excel, you have to do it way better than your competitor sitting at a similar desk across town or across the country.\n\nAnd if you can make that extra phone call at midnight to a source, send that one key email at 3 a.m., or take one more meeting at a bar after a long day, it can pay dividends in big ways.\n\nThese behind-the-scenes efforts tend to pay off in key moments in the business cycle or markets. Take, for example, this earnings season, where I've been chatting with leaders of public companies and top investing minds at the big banks.\n\nThe chats this go around have a different vibe to them, months removed from Election Day.\n\nIn the case of some, we are discussing the state of a consumer that has been less confident. In others, we are getting right into concerns about the run-up to the election and what policies may shape profits in 2025 and beyond.\n\nHere's what I am hearing, obtained simply by talking to a lot of people \u2014 just like an OG journalist such as Mr. Sloan has done for years.\n\nOtis CEO Judy Marks\n\nElevator maker Otis (OTIS) didn't have a blowout quarter this week. Instead, the company issued a warning on China demand.\n\nMarks \u2014 who also sits on the board of dump truck maker Caterpillar (CAT) \u2014 offered up observations on potential new tariffs, which Trump has floated. Our full interview can be seen in the above video.\n\n\"I think tariffs impact the American economy. They impact the American citizen no matter what they buy. We've seen that since tariffs have continued to go up regardless of which party wins. We need a pro-growth environment that allows us businesses that are multinational businesses to operate in a high-quality trade environment that everyone understands.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo that we can compete and when we can compete overseas, it drives additional economic growth and jobs here in the US, and that goes across all industries. A trade war, a tariff war, is not in the American economy's best interests, nor in our citizens' best interest.\"\n\nWhirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer\n\nAppliance giant Whirlpool (WHR) also had a tough quarter, fueled by softness in the US housing market. In talking to Bitzer, I didn't get the sense the company's US business would inflect this year even if the Fed cuts interest rates in the fall.\n\nNote that Bitzer declined to comment on whether European industrial behemoth Bosch has expressed interest in buying the company, as has been recently reported.\n\n\"As we internally talk about, interest rates don't change demographic trends or the age of the housing stock. The age of the housing stock is the highest it's been in my history.\n\nDemographic trends are strong. It's the interest rates, mortgage rates, and this famous lock in effect which many consumers experience, which holds everything back. I would, however, be cautious. One interest rate reduction won't unfreeze the market. I think it will take several moves. I would expect that probably you need mortgage rates to be in the five-something range to really see some momentum building.\"\n\nGeneral Motors CFO Paul Jacobson\n\nUnlike the two names mentioned above, General Motors (GM) did have a very solid quarter \u2014 markedly better, I would argue, than Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA).\n\nNo doubt EVs have become politicized this presidential election cycle. Jacobson told me the company is trying to \"rise above\" the political theater.\n\nHe did acknowledge, though, that GM has benefited from the Biden administration's efforts to promote EVs in the country, from building out the charging network to offering a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers. How that shifts under a potential Trump-led White House is unknown.\n\n\"I think we've obviously benefited from some of the jobs incentives and industry creation, but we've created thousands of jobs at our battery cell plants, module assembly, etc. And these are good, strong union jobs by American workers. So we're going to continue to invest. We're in this for the long term because, as we see it, it's about consumer choice.\"\n\nAmerican Express CEO Stephen Squeri\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) continues to feel the tailwind of younger consumers paying up to be cardholders, in part as it adds more perks (such as these new ones, reported by Yahoo Finance's personal finance team).\n\nThat appeared to be enough for Amex to hike its full-year guidance, despite signs of a more cautious consumer. The company is also lifting its full-year marketing budget by a whopping $800 million.\n\nI asked Squeri if he was more cautious on the second half of the year:\n\n\"If I was baking in more caution I wouldn't have raised the guidance. I wouldn't be increasing the marketing and so forth. I think that the key point here is the Fed will do what the Fed is going to do probably in September. They are certainly not going to raise rates, they'll probably be cut, they'll probably be another cut before the end of the year. I think that'll help consumer confidence. I think we'll see whatever happens in the election in November, which I don't think anybody has any idea and the reality is, this company has been around 174 years with 30 presidents \u2014 we'll get through whatever is we need to get through.\"\n\nChipotle CFO Jack Hartung\n\nHartung will be retiring soon from Chipotle (CMG) after a successful 23-year run as CFO. Very few have done it better.\n\nBut before he exits, Hartung did highlight a few challenges on his earnings call this week. One that stood out to me was resistance to higher prices in California after the state raised its minimum wage for food workers.\n\nI'm not used to Chipotle calling out price resistance.\n\nHere's what Hartung told me:\n\n\"We did have to increase prices between 6.5% to 7% when we raised wages almost 20%. And what we've seen is not so much resistance. So it's not because the Chipotle burrito costs a little more. There's really reduced spending across the restaurant industry. And when we've looked at it, restaurant companies that took a very high increase [in California] had an impact on sales, about the same as what we've seen. Restaurants that have taken no increase had the same kind of reduction in sales.\n\nSo it's really because everything is more expensive. The customer has pulled back on dining out pretty much across the board.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson\n\nWilson lead a large team at Morgan Stanley (MS), and speaks to some of the most influential investors in the world. He's one of the most widely followed strategists on Wall Street, amid years of on-the-mark calls (such as his 2022 bear market prediction).\n\nWith tech stocks coming under fresh pressure this week, what Wilson told me on Opening Bid regarding AI stock valuations was intriguing:\n\n\"AI is sucking all of the oxygen out of the room. But now I think we are entering that dangerous part of the story where we need to see it in the numbers. I see AI everywhere, except in the numbers. Outside of a few companies where it's obviously been dramatic, it hasn't really driven revenues and earnings anywhere.\"\n\nMore on the AI trade here.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings, a Fed meeting, and the July jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "The stock market rally is in its most fragile state in months ahead of Wall Street's busiest week of the summer.\n\nThe S&P 500 (GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) recently had their worst single-day drops since 2022 as the indexes struggled to recover losses during a Friday rally. All three major averages closed the final full week of July lower. The S&P 500 was down more than 1%, while the Nasdaq fell over 2.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose about 0.6%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Federal Reserve meeting, the July jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) will drive the direction of markets to kick off August.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nA busy week of corporate earnings awaits, with 171 members of the S&P 500 expected to report quarterly results. AMD (AMD), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD), and Starbucks (SBUX) will be among the companies highlighting the schedule.\n\nA September 'signal'\n\nThe Fed will announce its latest monetary policy decision next Wednesday. Markets largely expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its July meeting.\n\nRecent updates in the economy have investors eyeing when the Fed's first cut will come though. In June, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.6% over the prior year, its lowest annual increase in more than three years. Separate data for the month showed a significant decrease in another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market has shown signs of cooling. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers is back at pre-pandemic levels, and last month, the unemployment rate hit its highest level since November 2021.\n\nThis has prompted markets to price in the Fed's first cut in September, and investors will be keenly listening to Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for any confirmation.\n\n\"The overall tone from the meeting, including from Chair Powell's press conference, should signal that a rate cut in September is a reasonable baseline without pre-committing to this action,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note to clients. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell departs after holding a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., May 1, 2024. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLabor market look\n\nFriday will bring a fresh look at monthly job additions as economists continue to debate whether recent cooling in the labor market represents normalization or more significant deterioration.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe July jobs report is expected to show 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%, according to data from Bloomberg. In June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.\n\n\"The 180K increase to payrolls we expect in July would still be a respectable gain, but would underscore that, directionally, the jobs market is deteriorating,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"By a range of measures, including the unemployment rate, quit rate, level of temporary help workers and small business hiring plans, the labor market is not only softer than a year or two ago, but weaker compared to its pre-pandemic state.\"\n\nGiven this backdrop, whether unemployment holds steady or ticks up as it has for the past three months will be in particular focus.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nThe stock market's recent slump has included a big sell-off in tech.\n\nSince July 10, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) \u2014 which tracks Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 has dropped about 12%.\n\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner recently told Yahoo Finance the pullback has made sense given the runup in Big Tech stocks over the past year and how overstretched positioning in many of the large tech stocks had become. This, combined with investors rotating into less-loved areas of the market rally that could benefit from the Fed cutting interest rates, has become the hallmark of the market action over the past two weeks.\n\nEarnings from four of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks \u2014 Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 could change that. But as the sell-off after Alphabet and Tesla earnings showed in the prior week, it's been a tough season to impress investors with earnings.\n\n\"When we look at the earnings that we've seen over the last week, I don't think the earnings are bad,\" Lerner said. \"I don't think the businesses, the fundamental business trends, are bad, but I just think that they were not good enough relative to these really high [expectations].\"\n\nAnd, to Lerner's point, stocks that miss on Wall Street estimates for earnings, revenue, or both are seeing significantly worse price reactions in the next trading day than typically seen over the past five years, according to research from Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.\n\nFor now, Emanuel wrote in a note to clients, \"earnings remain a catalyst for volatility, not higher S&P 500 prices.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, July (-14.2 expected, -15.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: McDonald's (MCD), Philips (PHG), Tilray (TLRY)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA, May (7.2% prior); Conference Board consumer confidence, July (99.7 expected, 100.4 prior) JOLTS job openings, June (8.14 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, (-4.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), BP (BP), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Electronic Arts (EA), First Solar (FSLR), JetBlue (JBLU), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Merck (MRK), Pinterest (PINS), Pfizer (PFE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Starbucks (SBUX), SoFi (SOFI)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended July 26 (-2.2% prior); ADP private payrolls, July (+168,000 expected, +150,000 prior); Minnesota Chicago PMI, July (44.0 expected, 47.4 prior); Employment cost index, second quarter (1.0% expected, 1.2% prior); Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Meta (META), Altria (MO), Arm (ARM), Boeing (BA), Carvana (CVNA), Generac (GNRC), Humana (HUM), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), Paycom (PAYC), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, July, (+19.8% prior); Unit labor costs, second quarter (+4% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending July 27 (235,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July final (49.5 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, July (+0.2% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM manufacturing, July (49 expected, 48.5 prior); ISM prices paid, July (52.1 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Canada Goose (GOOS), Coinbase (COIN), ConocoPhillips (COP), Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Mobileye (MBLY), Moderna (MRNA), Roku (ROKU) SiriusXM (SIRI), Wayfair (W)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, July (+175,000 expected, +206,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (4.1% expected, 4.1% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, July (+0.3% expected, +0.3% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, July (+3.7% expected, +3.9% prior); Average weekly hours worked, July (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, July (62.6% previously); Factory orders, June (+0.5% expected, -0.5% prior); Durable goods orders, June final (-6.6% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Soar 1,110% by 2029, According to Cathie Wood",
        "content": "Ark Investment Management operates eight exchange-traded funds that invest in companies developing innovative technologies, including electric vehicles (EVs), robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nArk's CEO, Cathie Wood, recently called Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) the biggest AI opportunity in the world because of its full self-driving (FSD) platform, which could create several new revenue streams for the EV giant. Wood and her team published a report last month suggesting Tesla stock could soar to $2,600 over the next five years, thanks mostly to FSD.\n\nThat would represent a whopping 1,110% upside from where the stock trades today. Surprisingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even came out and said hitting that target would be challenging. So, what are the chances Wood is right? Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla's core business is under serious pressure\n\nMusk used to tell investors that Tesla could grow its EV business by 50% per year for the foreseeable future. But despite a record 2023 with over 1.8 million deliveries, that was only a 38% growth rate compared to its 2022 result. Now, two quarters into 2024, the company has delivered just 830,766 cars, which is down 6.5% compared to the year-ago period.\n\nMusk abandoned all sales guidance during the second quarter (ended June 30), leaving investors to speculate that 2024 won't bring any growth at all. To make matters worse, Tesla has aggressively slashed prices to spur demand. It cut prices by an average of 25.1% in 2023 (according to Cox Automotive), and the EV industry, in general, saw a further 9.7% year-over-year price decline during the first quarter of this year.\n\nThat is crushing Tesla's coveted gross profit margin, which came in at just 14.6% (excluding regulatory credits) during Q2. It has been cut in half from just two years ago when it was regularly hovering above 30%. It's dealing a blow to the company's bottom line, with net income sinking 45% during Q2 to just $1.4 billion.\n\nTesla faces a number of headwinds. Demand for EVs, in general, appears to be softening, likely due to tough economic conditions led by high interest rates, and Tesla isn't the only manufacturer taking notice. Despite generating strong growth in EV sales in the recent quarter, both General Motors and Ford continue to pull back on planned production expansions.\n\nOn that note, competition is another threat to Tesla, and not just from legacy brands like General Motors and Ford. China-based BYD continues to churn out low-cost EVs, including the Seagull, which sells for under $10,000 in its domestic market and will soon make its way to Europe, where Tesla has a strong presence.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla plans to deliver an affordable EV in the first half of next year, which could be priced at $25,000. Time will tell whether it will be enough to reignite sales growth.\n\nWood's forecast rests on the success of FSD\n\nMusk spent most of his recent Q2 conference call with investors talking about Tesla's other opportunities, which include full self-driving and its Optimus humanoid robot. FSD is the key component of Ark's financial models, which suggest the technology will account for 63% of Tesla's total revenue by 2029.\n\nMusk says FSD version 12.5 is now rolling out, which is based on an AI model with five times the parameters of version 12.4. In other words, it should be far more capable than its predecessor. Ark says Tesla customers have used the beta versions of full self-driving to navigate more than 1.3 billion miles in the real world so far.\n\nBased on the data collected, Ark concludes that a Tesla vehicle running FSD is 16 times safer than the average car on American roads, with just one crash per 3,200 miles compared to one crash per 192 miles for human-driven vehicles. That will go a long way to convincing regulators to approve the wider release of FSD software.\n\nTesla could monetize full self-driving in three ways:\n\nIt plans to sell the software to Tesla customers on a subscription basis (the beta version is already for sale). Tesla could license FSD to other automakers for a fee. Musk wants to build a ride-hailing network similar to Uber except without human drivers.\n\nSubscription and licensing fees are conventional ways to earn revenue from software. But the ride-hailing aspect is what Ark is most excited about. Tesla's FSD-powered robotaxi is expected to be revealed on Oct. 10, and if it eventually clears regulatory hurdles, it could operate a ride-hailing service around the clock. In essence, that will allow Tesla to earn a slice of every mile driven with very few ongoing operating costs.\n\nArk's price target for Tesla stock might be overly optimistic\n\nIn order for Tesla stock to reach $2,600, Ark's financial models suggest the company will need to generate $1.2 trillion in annual revenue by 2029. Wall Street analysts think it will bring in $99.2 billion in revenue this year, so that figure will have to grow at a compound annual rate of 64.6% through 2029.\n\nConsidering the 2024 estimate represents just 2% year-over-year growth, Ark's models don't reflect reality at this stage.\n\nTesla also has a valuation issue. Based on the company's trailing 12-month earnings per share of $2.34 and its current stock price of $216, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 92.3. That is almost three times more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9. Keep in mind that Tesla's earnings are currently shrinking very quickly, so it's hard to justify the stock's premium valuation relative to its peers.\n\nOf course, Tesla's current results mainly reflect its EV business alone. Ark's forecast basically relies on Tesla's robotaxi going from zero revenue today to a whopping $756 billion in annual revenue by 2029. It hasn't even launched yet, and at this stage, nobody knows for sure whether FSD will ever receive the blessing of regulators.\n\nIn my opinion, the odds of Tesla stock soaring 1,110% to $2,600 between now and 2029 are slim. I think it's a great company with an exciting future, but investors might want to wait on the sidelines until its stock trades at a P/E ratio that is more in line with the broader market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nAnalysts lift Nvidia PTs ahead of Blackwell launch\n\nPiper Sandler analysts on Monday reaffirmed an Overweight rating for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised their target price from $120 to $140 in a move driven by strong expectations ahead of the company's earnings report for the July quarter and guidance for the October quarter.\n\n\"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe investment bank views the launch of the Blackwell architecture as a catalyst for a new phase of growth, anticipating continued strong demand from cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and sovereign entities. Analysts believe that demand for NVIDIA's upcoming B100/B200 products will significantly outpace supply.\n\nIn its bullish scenario, Piper Sandler says NVDA could exceed expectations by more than $2 billion in reported revenue for the July quarter, thanks to a recovery in networking supply.\n\n\"In our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market,\" the analysts added.\n\nSimilarly, Loop Capital analysts increased their price target for Nvidia stock from $120 to $175, citing the company's potential to significantly exceed consensus revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2026.\n\nAmazon \u2018most favored among mega-caps\u2019 - Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo analysts have identified Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the \"most favored long among mega-caps\" as the tech giant approaches its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nDespite mixed hedge fund positioning for competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Wells Fargo believes Amazon stands out due to strong performance expectations and positive forward commentary.\n\nThe bank's analysts predict an 18% increase in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue for the second quarter, with a sufficient operating income (OI) guidance of $16 billion for the third quarter.\n\nWells Fargo also plans to closely monitor Amazon's air freight commentary, estimating its impact on third-quarter operating income to be in the $200-$400 million range.\n\n\"See AMZN as the most favored long among mega-caps vs. META with more mixed HF positioning,\" the analysts stated, highlighting strong investor sentiment towards Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey note that the upcoming second-quarter earnings reports will be critical for understanding CapEx allocation and return time frames, especially given potential changes in AI strategy at AWS following the recent CEO change.\n\nApple seen as \u2018more stable AI play for volatile times\u2019, PT hiked\n\nRaymond James analysts have raised their stock price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $250 from $200, describing the company as \"a more stable AI play for volatile times.\" The firm maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, expecting a slight beat in F3Q24 results and an outlook in line with previous expectations.\n\nThis optimism is based on recent conversations in the Asia supply chain, TSM results, and China CAICT data, all indicating positive near-term trends for iPhone and Mac sales.\n\n\"We expect a slight beat and largely in-line outlook,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nWhile near-term results may not significantly impact the AI narrative, Raymond James remains \"optimistic that upcoming AI features will drive a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\n\nThe firm pointed to upward revisions in iPhone 16 builds for the second half of 2024, based on supply chain conversations, and mentioned significant changes to the internals of the iPhone 17, indicating Apple's increased focus on enhancing on-device AI capabilities.\n\n\"Supply chain data also points to material changes to iPhone 17 internals, suggesting that Apple is looking to do more AI on the device,\" analysts noted.\n\nApple's unique position in offering on-device AI features stems from its strong ecosystem, advanced hardware capabilities, and a focus on privacy.\n\n\"We believe Apple is in a unique position to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus,\" the note added.\n\nBaird: Buy QCOM after recent pullback\n\nEarlier in the week, Baird analysts added Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock as a \u201cBullish Fresh Pick\u201d and increased their target price on the stock to $250.\n\nThis revision follows Baird\u2019s initial channel feedback, which revealed a procurement units estimate of over 90 million for the upcoming iPhone 16, a significant rise from the low 80 million units of previous iPhone launches.\n\n\u201cSimilar to the Galaxy S24 launch earlier this year, AI is the driver,\u201d analysts noted.\n\nThey expect strengthening demand trends in Qualcomm's handset business in the third quarter of the calendar year, following a seasonal trough in the second quarter and a year-over-year comparison trough in the first quarter.\n\nBaird\u2019s team believes that AI will drive double-digit increases in Qualcomm's average selling prices (ASPs) for various components, starting with the iPhone 16 in the second half of this year. Moreover, initial AI content in high-end phones from Chinese smartphone OEMs will contribute, followed by the next-generation Galaxy platform in the first half of 2025.\n\nRadio Frequency (RF) ASP and content are also expected to benefit from AI beginning in the second half, driven by higher performance, faster uplinks, and greater integration.\n\nAdditionally, the investment firm pointed out a strong initial response for Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor in South Korea, as the chipmaker is the first to market in the initial wave of AI in PCs.\n\nSamsung (KS:005930) has launched Copilot+ PCs based on the X Elite, with demand surpassing initial channel expectations. Besides Samsung, the X Elite is also currently being shipped by HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Acer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lenovo.\n\n\u201cWe would be buyers of QCOM shares on recent share pullback,\u201d the analysts concluded.\n\nUBS says AI optionality already priced in Tesla stock, sees downside risk\n\nUBS analysts have reiterated their Sell rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), citing substantial downside risk due to overvaluation and challenges in the automotive business highlighted in its latest quarterly report.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock, which is currently trading at over 100 times its run-rate EPS of approximately $2.25, has a considerable amount of AI optionality already priced in, resulting in an inflated valuation.\n\n\"TSLA 2Q24 results showed the stress on the automotive business, just to keep vehicle deliveries ~1.78mm annualized units (which would be -2% y/y),\" analysts noted.\n\nThe bank pointed out that Tesla's aggressive pricing and promotional strategies to stimulate demand have caused its auto gross margin, excluding credits, to drop to 14.6%, the lowest since the first quarter of 2019.\n\nAdjusting for higher-than-normal credits and restructuring charges, UBS estimates Tesla's run-rate EPS to be around $0.56, which still includes a strong but potentially volatile quarter for its Energy business.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are skeptical about the near-term drivers for Tesla's earnings. While the introduction of a new lower-cost model and increased Full Self-Driving (FSD) take rates could provide some support, the analysts argue that even an improvement of $1 per share in earnings would still leave the stock trading at over 75 times its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe analysts assert that Tesla's current stock price heavily relies on future AI initiatives such as robo-taxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nThey believe Tesla's stock faces more downside risk if confidence in these AI initiatives wavers. Upcoming events like Robo-taxi day on October 10 could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" reaction, emphasizing the overvaluation of the stock based on uncertain future opportunities, analysts explained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged\n\nWhat are the best trades to position for a red wave in the US election?\n\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Will Rivian Become the Next Tesla?",
        "content": "Every electric vehicle (EV) maker wants to become the next Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Since going public in 2010, Tesla shares have increased in value by 15,700%. The S&P 500, by comparison, rose by just 600% over the same time period.\n\nMany investors in Rivian Automotive(NASDAQ: RIVN) are betting that it will become the next Tesla. And there are several good reasons to think they're right. Here are the three most important factors to pay attention to.\n\n1. It's all about cold, hard cash\n\nThe EV industry is rife with failures. Just last month, Fisker declared bankruptcy, saying that it would liquidate all of its assets.\n\nEven Tesla flirted with bankruptcy before becoming the success it is today. In 2020, Elon Musk revealed that the company was \"about a month\" away from insolvency after it ran into production problems with its Model 3 sedan.\n\nThe reason bankruptcy has been common in the EV world is that the industry is incredibly capital intensive, and the conventional-vehicle market is much the same.\n\nMaking cars and trucks requires billions of dollars in machinery, plus huge workforces to design, test, and sell these products into a hypercompetitive, highly saturated market.\n\nIf a company doesn't have access to huge sums of money, it won't make it for long as a vehicle manufacturer. In this regard, Rivian is about as good as it gets.\n\nIn 2019, deep-pocketed Amazon led its $700 million funding round. In 2021, it closed a $2.5 billion funding round with participation from both Amazon and Ford. And just last month, it secured a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen, a figure that could eventually grow to $5 billion through joint ventures and Rivian hitting certain milestones.\n\nThere's no guarantee that an economic downturn won't affect Rivian's access to capital. And the company's total cash balance has fallen from $11.2 billion to just $7.9 billion over the last 12 months. But it looks prepared to execute on the next crucial factor: launching new models.\n\n2. Growth can't come unless this happens\n\nTesla's revenue in 2016 was around $7 billion. That was the year that its first mass market vehicle, the Model 3, was launched. Today, its revenue is around $95 billion. The introduction of new models like the Model 3 and Model Y were crucial contributors to massive increases in sales in recent years.\n\nWith ample access to capital, Rivian has the opportunity to replicate this sales surge. Earlier this year, management revealed plans to launch a midsize category with three new models, the R2, R3, and R3X. The R2 will be priced around $45,000. The R3 will be launched later at an even lower price point. These models aren't expected to hit the road until 2026, but Rivian's success as a company will depend on the commercial success of these vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nPay close attention to any potential manufacturing delays or shifts in pricing strategy. Tesla encountered plenty of its own production challenges along the way, so don't expect a completely smooth ramp-up. But if Rivian wants to become the next Tesla, it must nail the landing on the R2, and then the R3 and R3X. TSLA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\n3. Markets will celebrate this major event\n\nRight now, Rivian is losing around $39,000 for every vehicle it sells. That's an improvement from a $67,000 loss per vehicle in the first quarter of 2023, but the market won't backstop these losses forever.\n\nTesla was posting gross losses when it first went public in 2010, and then again briefly in 2012. But for the most part, it has strung together an impressive run of consecutive gross profits. TSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nRivian is apparently closing the gap quickly. \"We continue to move closer to making money on every vehicle we sell,\" the company's chief financial officer, Claire McDonough, said earlier this year.\n\nAnd management believes the company could turn a profit on a per-vehicle basis as early as the fourth quarter. That will be a stretch, but it's a crucial milestone that must eventually be reached.\n\nWill Rivian become the next Tesla? It won't be an easy road. But the company has many of the pieces in place to do so. Tracking the three variables listed above will give you a real-time understanding of the company's likelihood of becoming the next great EV brand.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Market participants showed their disappointment with last Tuesday's results from two of \u2018The Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks: Google parent Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.\n\nThe worrisome aspect of the market reaction to these two reports, particularly to the Alphabet release, is that this could be a precursor of what to expect this week from four other members of the group \u2013 Microsoft MSFT on Tuesday, July 30th, after the market\u2019s close (AMC), Meta Platforms META on Wednesday AMC, July 31st, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL on Thursday AMC, August 1st.\n\nIt is hard to say anything positive about the Tesla report, but the Alphabet report had a lot of positives. Unlike Tesla, which missed consensus estimates on the back to continued margin pressures, Alphabet beat estimates and had a number of other positives in its results, including search and cloud.\n\nInvestors instead zeroed in on the bigger-than-expected capital expenditure figure, which fed into creeping worries about ever-rising AI-centric capex without a timeline for when the spending will start to pay off. Alphabet management\u2019s comment on the capex question that underinvesting represented a bigger risk than the alternative likely added to the market\u2019s worries. A bigger jump in search growth that could be attributed to the company\u2019s AI investments would have eased some of those worries, but that was not the case.\n\nThe capex will likely be front and center in this week\u2019s Meta and Microsoft reports as well. Concerning Amazon, a leader in the cloud space through its Amazon Web Services business, there are questions about the business\u2019 decelerating growth trend in recent quarters when Microsoft and Alphabet are showing accelerating growth trends.\n\nApple has started making some AI announcements lately, but many in the market appear skeptical of its efforts. The more significant near-term Apple questions are about the evolving iPhone trends in China.\n\nReturning to the Alphabet and Tesla results, Alphabet\u2019s earnings were up +28.6% from the same period last year on +15% higher revenues. Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues.\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.8% from the same period last year on +9.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week\u2019s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 26th, we have seen Q2 results from 207 S&P 500 members, or 41.4% of the index\u2019s membership. Total earnings for these 207 index members are up +0.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and only 57.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 1000 companies on deck to report results, including 170 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 stocks, this week\u2019s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like McDonald\u2019s, Proctor & Gamble, Pfizer, Starbucks, Mastercard, Boeing, DuPont, Exxon, Chevron, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 57.5% is a new low for this group of 207 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 207 companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.9% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.7% on +1.7% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +4% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.4% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "title": "Time to Buy the Dip on Alphabet Following Earnings?",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings Tuesday and beat analysts\u2019 estimates on both the top and bottom line, yet the stock is rolling over. Is it time to get out of the stock? I think not, and rather it be a fantastic buying opportunity.\n\nThere are two primary reasons for Alphabet's sell-off following its recent earnings report, both of which I believe are temporary. First, the overall market weakness is weighing on the stock. Second, there are concerns about whether the significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure will generate sufficient near-term profits.\n\nWhile the concerns are reasonable, Alphabet is such a sturdy asset, that I believe you can overlook any near-term concerns as the long-term still looks so fruitful for the company.\n\nBut what is especially compelling is that GOOGL is trading at a relatively discounted valuation, while business fundamentals are strong, and the company enters exciting new technological ventures.\n\nFor investors who are keen on buying leading technology stocks at a discount, Alphabet may be the next addition to your portfolio. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nEarnings Beat but the Alphabet Stock Falls\n\nAlphabet has reported a solid second quarter for 2024, showcasing strong performance across its key segments and continued innovation in artificial intelligence. The company's results underline its robust financial health and strategic investments in AI and cloud infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet delivered revenues of $85 billion, marking a 14% year-on-year increase. This growth was driven by strong performance in Search and Cloud services. The Cloud segment achieved quarterly revenues exceeding $10 billion for the first time, alongside a notable $1 billion in operating profit.\n\nSearch revenues reached $48.5 billion, growing 13.8% year-over-year while Cloud revenues saw a slight acceleration, growing 28.8% to $10.4 billion. AI is playing a pivotal role here, with the majority of Alphabet's top 100 customers utilizing AI-driven services.\n\nAdditionally, seeing a reacceleration of the core search business is a fantastic development as many investors had begun to doubt it.\n\nFurthermore, notes about the development at Waymo are very encouraging and has to potential to open another massive business opportunity for Alphabet.\n\nHuge Potential in Autonomous Driving\n\nAlphabet announced that they would be committing another $5 billion to expansion at Waymo, and I think investors are still underestimating the incredible potential here.\n\nWaymo has made significant strides, delivering over 50,000 paid rides per week across San Francisco and Phoenix. But most importantly, Waymo has focused on optimizing its service for profitability and scalability, making strategic decisions that enhance its configurability across various vehicle types and conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a very different approach than Tesla (TSLA) is taking, as Alphabet believes providing the underlying technology will be a superior business model and is similar to the way GOOGL influences the mobile computing industry with Android. They make no devices but are the most widely used mobile software in the world.\n\nWaymo is also taking a bottom\u2019s up approach, developing its own sensors so to control the whole tech stack. Alternatively, Tesla relies solely on camera-based vision and must manage all the additional logistics of producing a full vehicle. The longer it takes Tesla to get full self-driving to actually work, the more I am favoring Waymo in leading the industry.\n\nAlphabet Stock Trading at a Discount\n\nAs noted, Alphabet is trading at a valuation that I consider to be appealing for long-term investors. Today, GOOGL is trading at 22x forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 26.1x and below the market average.\n\nBecause I believe Alphabet is among the best companies in the world, I think it unreasonable that it trades in line with the average of the index. With continued strong performance across business segments, and some incredible growth catalysts, I think Alphabet is compelling at current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDespite Alphabet's recent post-earnings dip, this may be an opportune moment for investors to buy the stock.\n\nAlphabet's second-quarter earnings report showed strong performance across key segments, with impressive growth in Search and Cloud services. The company continues to lead in AI-driven innovations, reinforcing its competitive edge. Additionally, the significant investment in Waymo highlights Alphabet's potential in the autonomous driving market, offering another promising growth avenue.\n\nAt its current valuation, Alphabet presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. For investors seeking to capitalize on a leading technology stock at a discount, Alphabet is a compelling choice.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Hot Stocks: Top 3 Analyst Upgrades You Can\u2019t Ignore in July",
        "content": "Today, we will discuss three recent analyst upgrades on Wall Street. Earnings season is in full swing, and the market is navigating volatility and uncertainty. The current market choppiness highlights the need for diversifying portfolios to include robust shares that may get analyst upgrades. On July 24, stocks sold off following underwhelming reports from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), causing the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite to post their worst sessions since 2022.\n\nWith tech stocks, especially those with an artificial intelligence (AI) focus, losing their luster in July, the Nasdaq Composite is trading around 8% below its all-time high of July 11. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is down nearly 5% from its record high on July 16.\n\nAs a result, investors are keeping an even closer eye on the earnings season and analyst upgrades for stocks that may release strong earnings. According to FactSet data, over 25% of S&P 500 companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, with nearly 80% exceeding expectations. Amid the current volatility, analyst upgrades are vital for pinpointing high-potential stock opportunities. With that information, here are three stocks with recent analyst upgrades to buy in the third quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nWe begin today\u2019s discussion with Accenture (NYSE:ACN), a standout among top stocks receiving analyst upgrades. This Ireland-based global professional services firm specializes in strategy, consulting, technology and operations.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 earnings report released on June 20, Accenture showed a mixed performance. Revenues grew 1.4% in local currency to $16.5 billion. However, adjusted net income fell 1.5% to $2.04 billion, and adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $3.13. The declines were due to negative foreign exchange impacts, business optimization costs and a higher tax rate.\n\nJuly was a busy month for Accenture, marked by strategic acquisitions and the addition of numerous firms to its portfolio. Management hopes the enlarged group will better support clients in system modernization and adopting cloud, data, AI and IoT technologies. It also launched the Accenture AI Refinery framework, built on Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Foundry, to help clients develop custom large language\u00a0models (LLMs).\n\nOn July 19, UBS (NYSE:UBS) upgraded Accenture from \u2018Neutral\u2019 to \u2018Buy\u2019 with a $400 price target, citing anticipated revenue growth from AI integration. Meanwhile, Wall Street\u2019s 12-month median price forecast for ACN stock is $350.00, indicating about 6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far in 2024, ACN stock has declined over 5% but offers a 1.6% dividend yield. The shares are trading at 25.3 times forward earnings and 3.3 times sales.\n\nAllstate (ALL) Allstate Insurance office\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list of stocks with analyst upgrades is the insurer Allstate (NYSE:ALL). The company provides various property and casualty insurance products in the U.S. and Canada. They focus on providing personal lines insurance \u2014 for individuals and families rather than businesses.\n\nOn May 1, Allstate reported robust financial results for the first quarter. Consolidated revenues surged 10.7% YOY to $15.3 billion. Adjusted net income made a remarkable turnaround, from a net loss of $342 million to a net profit of $1.4 billion. Additionally, adjusted diluted EPS jumped to $5.13 from a loss of $1.30 last year. Stronger property liability underwriting results drove this success.\n\nIn a vote of confidence, BMO Capital, part of Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO), upgraded Allstate to \u2018Outperform\u2019 from \u2018Market Perform,\u2019 raising the price target to $191. BMO Capital highlighted the success of Allstate\u2019s five-year transformation plan, which positions the company for a more aggressive customer acquisition strategy. On average, Wall Street analysts project a 12-month price target of $195.00 for ALL stock with a potential upside of 18%.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), ALL stock has soared almost 18%, complemented by a 2.2% dividend yield. The shares are trading at 13.7 times forward earnings and 0.8 times sales.\n\nPermian Resources (PR) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours.

        "title": "Mexico Peso Gets Battered From All Sides, Leads Currency Losses",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Mexico\u2019s peso crashed into some formidable global forces this week \u2014 Elon Musk, Donald Trump and the Japanese yen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Paris Sticks to Olympics Opening Event Plans After Rail Sabotage Fed\u2019s Favored Price Gauge Rises at Mild Pace, Spending Holds Up Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her The Private Equity Staffer With a Shot at Olympic Glory\n\nThe currency shed more than 2% in the past five days, leading global losses as a rally in the yen deterred carry traders, Musk delayed a $10 billion investment and Trump indulged in some Mexico bashing.\n\nMusk\u2019s decision to pause the investment by Tesla Inc. dented optimism over nearshoring, the move to bring production capacity closer to the giant US market. The problem, Musk said, was political risk from Trump\u2019s pledges to impose more tariffs on Mexico-made goods. And then Trump himself weighed in. Asked by Fox News if he would strike against drug cartels across the border, Trump replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d and warned Mexico to \u201cstraighten it out real fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nobody running out and embracing Mexico\u2019s golden moment of nearshoring anymore,\u201d said Alejandro Silva, chief investment officer at Silva Capital Management in Chicago. \u201cThat whole narrative has been ripped up until we see an election outcome.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a rally in the yen undermined the second factor that has stoked the peso\u2019s strength over the past few years \u2014 carry traders. The yen is a leading funding currency for investors looking to profit from Mexico\u2019s high interest rates. It\u2019s rally led to a massive unwinding of carry trades.\n\nPoster Child\n\nThe Tesla plant had become the poster-child for nearshoring, a trend that had helped make the peso the top performing major currency in the world earlier this year and last.\n\nIts delay came as a blow to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has boasted of record foreign investment into the country. Those investments have been driven by corporations already in the country, rather than new players, who may be putting their plans on ice.\n\n\u201cMusk materialized the fears that Trump could scare away investment and the nearshoring opportunity for Mexico,\u201d said Gabriela Siller, head of economic analysis at Grupo Financiero Base, adding the peso was \u201con a fast track to 19\u201d per dollar from current levels near 18.50.\n\nAsked about Musk\u2019s decision in his daily press conference, AMLO, as the president is known, dismissed the billionaire\u2019s concerns, saying Trump\u2019s threat was a bluff due to the potential impact on the US economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhatever the case, Trump has ratcheted up attacks on Mexico, promising tariffs and mass deportations, since his nomination speech at the Republican convention last week. There, he unveiled his running mate, Senator JD Vance, who also wants to deal harshly with Mexico, proposing a 10% tax on remittances late last year in the senate.\n\nYen Volatility\n\nMeanwhile, the yen rose to its strongest mark in more than two months Thursday sparking liquidations in higher-yielding assets around the world. It could rally even more if the Bank of Japan raises interest rates next week, though bets are tilted toward a hold.\n\nYen-funded bets on the peso have been popular with both global hedge funds and retail investors in Japan over the last few years. If the yen firms past 151 per dollar from the current 153.8, it could drive more losses, said Luis Estrada, a strategist at RBC Dominion Securities Inc.\n\nAt the same time, a raft of Mexican constitutional reforms could push the peso to as weak as 20 per dollar around September, Estrada said.\n\nAll the factors have led the peso\u2019s six-month implied volatility to jump to about 14%, not far from the highest level since 2021.\n\nStrategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co., who have argued the peso is set to appreciate in the coming quarters, told clients earlier this week to hedge their exposure with a so-called calendar spread derivatives trade.\n\n\u201cMexico holds the biggest trade balance with the US and hence, the biggest vulnerability to a change in their commercial relationship,\u201d JPMorgan strategists including Tania Escobedo Jacob wrote in a note. \u201cMindful of the headline risks, we are keeping our MXN hedge.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Maria Elena Vizcaino.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors are fleeing Big Tech for value stocks\u2014sector must \u2018blow out\u2019 earnings to stop that, says analyst",
        "content": "Big Tech stocks that lifted markets to record highs in the first half of 2024 are now being pummeled. Mega cap tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon will have a chance to win back gains when they report quarterly earnings next week. But it may be too late. Investors\u2014eyeing a potential Fed rate cut or perhaps hedging against election and geopolitical uncertainty\u2014have already shifted funds to more value-oriented sectors in what the Wall Street Journalcalled \u201ca stock-market rotation of historic proportions.\u201d\n\nTo get a sense of what's underway, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq posted their worst sessions since 2022 Wednesday, falling 2.3% and 3.6%, respectively. After an initial recovery Thursday, they both declined again, with the S&P falling 0.51% and the Nasdaq dropping 0.93%. Over the last week, the small caps of the Russell 2000 have beaten the S&P by a margin not seen since at least the 1980s, per the Journal. (All three indexes climbed in early trading Friday, led by the Russell 2000.)\n\nThe \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d\u2014 a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla\u2014accounted for half of the 500\u2019s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Besides another rocky quarter from Tesla, these tech giants maintain immense profitability, market dominance and a head start in the AI race. More good news next week, however, might not buoy the markets.\n\nFor Q2 results from the tech behemoths reporting next week to quell the rotation, \u201cthey have to blow out estimates on every single line item,\u201d Ted Mortonson, a managing director at Baird, told Fortune.\n\nOne way to look at it, Angelo Zino, a senior tech analyst at CFRA Research, told Fortune, is that the stock market got three to four months ahead of itself as multiples skyrocketed. He said these metrics will likely settle and become more attractive as investors start looking out toward 2026 earnings estimates.\n\n\u201cWe think you're at a point in time now where kind of the earnings growth will outpace that of the stock price performance,\u201d he said, \u201cand that's going to help drive multiples to more favorable levels.\u201d\n\nMany institutional investors saw this as a long time coming. Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia were the three AI-related stocks dumped most by hedge funds in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report from Goldman Sachs, with Amazon not far behind. Nonetheless, even as hedge funds trimmed exposure to mega-cap tech stocks, the Magnificent Seven (minus Tesla) remained their most popular long positions, the report said.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday, however, Mortonson said he was worried about retail investors panicking if markets continued to get ugly. The worst thing they could do, he said, is look at their account statements over the weekend and rush to get out.\n\n\u201cEverybody was in the pool,\u201d Mortonson said. \u201cWell, now everybody has tried to get out of the pool.\u201d\n\nBig Tech still has \u201cfortress balance sheet\u201d\n\nLong-term, it\u2019s hard to bet against companies that have \u201cfortress balance sheets,\u201d as Mortonson put it, and boast bigger profits than most nations. The Magnificent Seven\u2019s collective free cash flow last year, for example, was expected to exceed over $300 billion, according to a February report from S&P Market Intelligence.\n\nThose mind-boggling statistics, meanwhile, aren\u2019t going to take a massive hit anytime soon. Consensus estimates have second quarter tech earnings growing 18% year-on-year, according to LSEG Datasteam numbers cited in a report from BlackRock, compared to 2% for the rest of the S&P 500.\n\nThough Tesla\u2019s profit margin fell to a five-year low, Alphabet beat earnings and revenue expectations Tuesday. Shares dropped slightly, however, after the company slightly missed estimates for YouTube ad revenue.\n\nOverall, the earnings trajectory for the tech sector, especially with most mega caps, remains significantly above the broader market, Zino said.\n\n\u201cBecause of that,\u201d he said, \u201cinvestors will come back into tech.\u201d It\u2019s just important to remember, he and Mortonson said, that stocks don\u2019t go straight up to the moon.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "They say what goes up must come down, but if you\u2019re the current stock market, coming down has taken a wild turn that may be on the cusp of straightening out.\n\n\u201cWe think this is the time for consolidation of the gains,\u201d Morgan Stanley's closely-watched chief investment officer Mike Wilson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here).\n\nWilson believes stocks are headed for a 10% correction in the third quarter, on the back of thin summer trading volume and yawning worries about the presidential election in November.\n\nBy and large, the market has side-stepped correction calls from Wall Street for much of the year.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 14% year to date amid strong corporate earnings and anticipation of interest rate cuts this fall. The Nasdaq Composite is up 13% this year, powered by AI optimism. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average has clocked in with a respectable 6% advance.\n\nBut cracks are emerging in the bull thesis.\n\nThe Nasdaq has been hit by almost 3% in the last five trading sessions due to valuation concerns, mixed results from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and outright poor earnings figures from Tesla (TSLA).\n\nMarket darling Nvidia (NVDA) has dropped by more than 5% in the past five days, while rival AMD (AMD) has shed around 10%.\n\nOver the past 10 days, the S&P 500 is down about 3%, while the Nasdaq is down more than 6%.\n\nWilson fancies those cracks may spread and weigh further on stocks in the near-term.\n\nHe points to the ISM Manufacturing Index remaining \u201cin contraction territory.\u201d Manufacturing woes is lessening, but services, which is still 70% of the economy, is now weakening \"substantially.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere we are is a late [economic] cycle still,\" Wilson adds.\n\nWith economic growth deteriorating, Wilson notes, stock multiples go up \u201cbecause of the hope for the Fed to ease policy.\u201d That's an unwelcome backdrop for investors to wade into stocks, Wilson says.\n\nAnd so is the fact the government is spending \u201cgobs of money on fiscal policy to keep things moving along.\"\n\nThe AI sell-off could also rage on, hurting broader market sentiment further.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re believers that AI will lead to productivity increases over time, but expectations got ahead of the timing of this development,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson isn't alone in bearish on the short-term.\n\nVeteran strategist Keith Lerner of Truist says the \"corrective period\" in tech has further to go. He downgraded his views on tech stocks in June.\n\nAdds Lerner, \"This choppier market action of late is consistent with our expectations, and is set to continue. Our base case is that the longer-term bull market remains intact, but it\u2019s often two steps forward, one step back.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Electrifying Its Best-Selling Pickup Isn't Enough To Bring Ford To The Promised EV Land",
        "content": "Electrifying Its Best-Selling Pickup Isn't Enough To Bring Ford To The Promised EV Land\n\nOn Wednesday, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) issued its second quarter results. Expectations were high after its Detroit peer, General Motors (NYSE: GM) lifted its full year profit guidance a day earlier. However, despite posting solid financials that topped estimates and raising its financial targets, shares of GM fell on Tuesday as Wall Street seems to fear the good times won\u2019t last.\n\nAlthough Ford did not follow the footsteps of GM, its\u00a0CEO Jim Farley\u00a0assured investors that Ford+ restructuring plan is on track as the Blue Oval continues to seek greater profitability.\n\nSecond quarter highlights\n\nFor the April through June quarter,\u00a0overall revenue, including its finance business, increased about 6% YoY to $47.81 billion. Automotive revenue amounted to\u00a0$44.81 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $44.02 billion.\n\nFord Blue, which stands for traditional business operations, brought in $1.17 billion.\u00a0Ford Pro commercial business exceeded the traditional business as it brought in $2.56 billion, while the \u201cModel e\u201d EV unit reported a loss of $1.14 billion. However, this does not mean that Ford\u2019s EV sales are not doing well as quite the opposite, they\u00a0surged 61.4%during the reported quarter fueled by Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning pickup, and E-Transit EV van.\u00a0General Motors also reported EV deliveries surged 40% YoY during the second quarter.\n\nIncreases\u00a0in its warranty reserves used to pay for vehicle issues weighed down profitability. Although CFO John Lawler\u00a0did not disclose the total warranty costs, he did reveal they were $800 milion greater compared to the previous quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $1.83 billion, or 46 cents per share with the adjusted EBIT declining 27% YoY to $2.76 billion or 47 cents per share, short of LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of 68 cents.\n\nRaised gree cash flow guidance, but earnings outlook left without a lift.\n\nFull year guidance was maintaned, with adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, expected in the range between $10 billion and $12 billion.\n\nFord+ restructuring plan remains on track.\n\nWith recent initiatives aimed at improving quality, Ford expects to bring down future warranty costs.\u00a0Lawler spoke of Ford making a real progress in raising quality, lowering costs and reducing complexity across the entire enterprise, which will undoubedly benefit the GM rival down the road. When announced in May 2021, the Ford+\u00a0initially revolved around EVs, but it has since been adjusted to adapt to customer choice and finding next-generation EVs that would drive profits. Now more realistic and sharpened, Ford\u2019s vision includes a small next-generation EV platform, which is a contrast compared to its best-selling pickup maker identity.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut,\u00a0EVs still only make a fraction of total sales.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Farley stressed that Ford is focusing on smaller and more profitable EVs in an effort to compete with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Chinese rivals like BYD. Although the EV unit reported remarkable growth, enabling Ford to keep its second best sellling EV maker position in the U.S. right behind Tesla, outpacing GM, Ford is still facing significant challenges on this front as it also gudied for a full year loss of\u00a0\u00a0$5.5 billion. Impressively,\u00a0the electric version of the F-150, the Lightning, recorded a sales jump of 77% while Mustang Mach-Efollowed with a surge of 46.5%, but the E-Transit van won the race with a sales rise of 95.5%.\u00a0\u00a0But the reality is that Ford has cut back on the productoion of Lightning and delayed abouy $12 billion in EV spending in response to slower than expected demand.\n\nAs for GM, EVs made only\u00a03.2% of\u00a0\u00a0total second-quarter U.S. sales.\u00a0GM does expect to become profitable in this arena, on a productio or contribution-margin basis, once it reaches the output of 200,000 units which is expected by the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the EV landscape continues to evolve, with innovative companies like Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) expected to raise the bar when it comes to electric pickups. This summer, Worksport is expected to launch the Alpha release of its solar-powered tonneau cover, Solis. Worksport is epxected to make quite a contirbution to the automotive sector with its intellectual asset portfolio. Together with the COR, a portable battery system, the SOLIS part of a power duo that Worksport developed with which it promises off-grid power on the go. The Solis will be available for the Ford F-150 Lightning, as well as light pickup trucks from General Motors, Stellantis, opening many new possibilities. As history has showed us, innovation has the way of paving the way for success. Therefore, just because it currently seems that the EV revolution is slowing down, it does not mean things could change in a blink of an eye when powerful innovation enters the room.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "It\u2019s been a hot summer for much of the country, but it\u2019s getting frosty if you\u2019re in the technology sector. Traders are starting to rotate out of overvalued tech stocks as they believe that lower interest rates may make some other sectors more attractive.\n\nDoes that mean the tech trade is over? It wouldn\u2019t seem so, but earnings season will be critical as traders pick winners and losers. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) took down the entire tech sector even though, in the case of Alphabet, the report wasn\u2019t bad at all.\n\nSuch is the nature of sky-high expectations. Traders will accept a high valuation until they don\u2019t. If you\u2019re a long-term investor, that can present opportunities.\u00a0If you believe in the stock\u2019s prospects, it\u2019s usually best just to ride out any short-term concerns. But if you\u2019re looking to profit from the rotation out of tech, here may be some overvalued tech stocks to consider selling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe next wave of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution will come from software. However, investors are waiting for the iPhone moment in AI. That is the application that shows every company why they need the services of a company like Palantir (NYSE:PLTR). And if you\u2019re bullish on Palantir, that will be the moment investors understand that Palantir isn\u2019t one of many. It is unique unto itself.\n\nPLTR stock is up 60% in 2024. Also, it trades at around 180x forward earnings. Dan Ives of Wedbush has called the company the Lionel Messi of AI. Other analysts believe the stock is priced for perfection that is not attainable.\n\nThe price action around Palantir continues to be led by retail investors. Institutional investors largely missed the stock when it was trading below $10 and again when it was trading below $20.\n\nCould some of the sour analyst calls be sour grapes? Perhaps, but it\u2019s just good to know that things could get choppy with PLTR stock. Palantir faces the privilege of expectations, and the burden that some of those expectations may be unrealistic in the short term.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe chip sector has been volatile to say the least. Even a market darling like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down approximately 15% from its closing price of $135.39 in June (it\u2019s still up 147% for the year). The issue comes down to supply and demand. And Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) is becoming the beneficiary.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t been enough to get investors charged up. AMD stock is up just 1.6% in 2024, and it\u2019s down 6.5% in the 30 days ending July 24, 2024. What gives? This remains a NVIDIA story. As Louis Navallier noted, Advanced Micro Devices is still in the early stages of its generative AI journey. Its recent acquisition of Silo AI will help. ,\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, investors need to decouple what could be volatile, bearish short-term performance for AMD stock from the long-term story. The AI revolution is still in the early stages and companies are looking for alternatives to NVIDIA. AMD is one of those competitors, but at 59x forward earnings, it\u2019s rightly viewed as one of the overvalued tech stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Website of Adobe (ADBE) Firefly seen in an iPhone. In Mar 2023 Adobe announced the beta launch of its new generative AI model Firefly.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is down 10% in 2024, despite analysts\u2019 estimates in the first two quarters.\n\nThe concern for investors is the unknown effect that generative AI will have on the company\u2019s business. After all, the Adobe relied on being the go-to source in content creation software. But even though Adobe has integrated AI into its content creation tools, it\u2019s too early to tell if that will be enough to keep competitors away.\n\nThat may be how institutions feel. Institutional buying is quieting down. After two quarters where buyers doubled up sellers, the buying and selling is virtually even this quarter and pretty slow at that. And before you think that\u2019s a \u201csell in May\u201d phenomenon, last year saw nearly $250 billion flow into ADBE stock.\n\nNotably, Adobe stock sold off at the same level it did in March. That could suggest that the stock will be range-bound for the near future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Bet On for Market-Crushing Returns",
        "content": "Just as the ancient Roman Empire was powered by human labor deployed in agriculture, the modern era relies on semiconductors to power the digital age. This makes investing in semiconductor stocks an easy proposition, as it is investing in the civilization itself.\n\nGlobally, the semiconductor stocks market is headed for a 10% CAGR by 2029 at $980.80 billion, according to Statista Market Insights. In the meantime, investors should put these stocks on a watchlist, if they haven\u2019t already.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three top semiconductor stocks to consider for massive portfolio returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nWidely viewed as overweight at a 72.29 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the psychological effect of the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split is not to be underestimated. Compared to its competitor AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), NVDA stock is priced cheaper. Simultaneously, it holds 88% dominance in the GPU market, per Jon Peddie Research as of Q1 of fiscal year 2024.\n\nWith equal cornering of the artificial intelligence (AI) generative demand market by providing both GPUs and a full-stack software suite for early large language model (LLM) trainers, much is also expected of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture. This new lineup of B100 and B200 GPUs purportedly offer up to 15x performance while drastically lowering power consumption.\n\nMoreover, according to a recent report, the B200 series AI chips are on their way to be repackaged as \u201cB20\u201d, a somewhat hobbled version intended for China due to US export control restrictions. Although China is busy building its own semiconductor foundries to counteract US pressure, the reliance of Chinese AI companies on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA platform is still in effect.\n\nAt the same time, the US could hit China with another block. If this happens to the H20 chip, the one Nvidia specifically designed to go around the export control license, the company could lose up to $12 billion revenue, according to Jeffries\u2019 latest notes to investors.\n\nWith that in mind, Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) upped NVDA stock target from $120 to $140. UBS is even more optimistic, citing robust Blackwell demand, having raised their price target from $120 to $150.\n\nAccording to 39 analyst inputs aggregated by Nasdaq, the average NVDA price target is $142.67 per share. At present $112.28 price, NVDA shares are below the 52-week high of $140.76. In the last three months, NVDA stock is up 53%.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the computer networking category, key player Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) caters to growing data center needs. The firm sells both multilayer network switches and software solutions to large enterprises. Those include cloud computing to high-performance computing (HPC) used in the training of AI models.\n\nIn light of the CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) debacle, it should also be noted that ANET uses a Linux-derived Extensible Operating System (EOS). The open standard OS is exceedingly customizable. It defines Arista Network\u2019s suite of products to scale data centers and connect multiple clouds.\n\nThe multi-purpose architecture of EOS separates protocol processing from state information. In other words, an in-service software upgrade with EOS wouldn\u2019t have disrupted the global economy as CrowdStrike with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows did.\n\nOn July 30th, Arista is scheduled to announce its Q2 FY24 earnings. In the prior quarter, the company reported 16.3% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth to $1.57 billion. Net income was even better, having increased by 46% to $637.7 million. In Q2, the company expects $1.62 to $1.65 billion revenue range.\n\nAnd, subsequent quarters may exceed that range. At the present price of $314.12, ANET stock is close to its 52-week high of 376.50, up 40% in the last three months. The average ANET price target is $324.5 with the high target of $385 per share.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDASQ:NXPI) provides automakers with integrated circuits that make vehicles easier to drive and connect to digital platforms. Those include Ford (NYSE:F), Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF), BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAF). Further, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was among the first to push this concept known as software-defined vehicles (SDVs).\n\nHowever, Tesla preferred to partner with Nvidia as NXP\u2019s direct competitor in the automotive solutions arena. Additionally, NXPI offers ultra-low-power microcontrollers alongside high-performance processors for the broad application in IoT and mobile\u2019s near-field communication (NFC) embedded systems.\n\nIn Q2 earnings delivered on Monday, the Dutch company reported $3.13 billion revenue, down 5% YOY. Likewise, the company\u2019s net income dropped 5.7%, at $658 million. This means that, although NXP beat earnings estimates for three consecutive quarters up until Q2, the surprise was only -0.71%, at $2.82 estimated versus $2.8 earnings per share reported.\n\nHowever, as a cyclical company, investors should expect to see tailwinds ahead, riding on NXPs S32 CoreRide platform for the next generation of SDVs. This makes NXPI as one of top semiconductor stocks in this exciting new market.\n\nPresently priced at $247.51, NXPI shares are up 20% over the last three months. Expected average price target is $294.52 per share. The high estimate is $370 based on Nasdaq data.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Meta, Apple, Amazon and also UK interest rates",
        "content": "With earnings season in full swing, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players \u2013 Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon (AMZN) \u2013 experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisations. Amid a tech rout, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWith Tesla failing to impress, will the next earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nMeta (META) \u2013 Reports second-quarter results on Wednesday 31 July\n\nMeta Platforms is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with significant investor attention on advertising revenue performance and updates regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives following the announcement of its latest AI model.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram is expected to report revenue of $38.35bn, reflecting a 20% increase compared to the same period last year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net income is projected to reach $12.31bn, or $4.71 per share, marking a substantial 58% year-over-year rise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnalyst estimates for Q2 2024:\n\nRevenue: $38.35bn (Q1 2024: $36.46bn, Q2 2023: $32bn) Diluted Earnings Per Share: $4.71 (Q1 2024: $4.71, Q2 2023: $2.98) Net Income: $12.31bn (Q1 2024: $12.37bn, Q2 2023: $7.79bn)\n\nMeta's second-quarter ad revenue is a critical metric, with Citi analysts predicting a 20.5% growth from the previous year, reaching $37.95bn. This growth is attributed to a stronger advertising environment, increased adoption of Instagram Reels, and new advertising products.\n\nStory continues\n\nA survey conducted by Wedbush analysts revealed that most advertisers plan to either increase or maintain their spending on Meta platforms. This trend is expected to contribute to robust second-quarter results and set a positive trajectory for the company in the latter half of the year.\n\nEarlier this month, Meta introduced its Llama 3.1 open-source AI model. JP Morgan analysts believe this launch could position Meta AI as the leading AI assistant by the end of the year. The upcoming earnings report will provide Meta an opportunity to reassure investors that its increased investments in AI are yielding significant growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s commentary is just as important as the numbers themselves. In today's landscape, throwing cash at AI is the aim of the game, but Meta needs to convince investors there\u2019ll be a worthy return at the end of the road,\u201d Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nApple (AAPL) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 1 August\n\nApple has seen adjustments in stock price targets from several firms ahead of its upcoming fiscal third-quarter earnings report.\n\nJPMorgan has raised its stock price target for Apple to $265 from $245, maintaining an overweight rating on the shares. The firm has set a new year-end 2025 price target, moving away from its prior December 2024 target, as it anticipates investors will begin focusing beyond 2024. JPMorgan expects Apple to instil higher confidence with its forthcoming earnings report.\n\nIts analysts believe that Apple will reassure investors about the upcoming AI replacement cycle, set to commence significantly in fiscal 2025 and intensify into fiscal 2026. They note that Apple is leveraging a stronger launchpad in fiscal 2024, bolstered by better-than-expected revenue drivers from the iPhone and the company as a whole.\n\nThe investment bank has placed Apple shares on \"positive catalyst watch\" ahead of the earnings report, with a favourable outlook on share price performance.\n\nBarclays has also revised its stock price target for Apple, increasing it to $187 from $164, while maintaining an underweight rating on the shares. The firm has raised its forecasts for the September quarter, citing better performance in iPhone, Mac and Services, a trend not seen in several quarters. Barclays now projects a 9% revenue growth for Apple in 2025, following two years of relatively flat performance.\n\nDespite the improved numbers and the potential positive impact of an artificial intelligence-enhanced iPhone on investor sentiment, Barclays remains cautious. The bank points out that Apple's stock is trading at a 30-times price-to-earnings multiple, indicating less upside potential compared to other firms' projections.\n\nApple's AI services will be available starting this fall, but only for the current iPhone 15 Pro model, fuelling hopes for a new iPhone upgrade cycle.\n\nApple is expected to return to top-line growth for the June-ended quarter. The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $84.2bn, up 3% vs. the year-ago quarter. Adjusted profit is expected to rise 6% to $1.34 a share.\n\n\u201cA note of caution stems from competition in China after back-to-back quarters of revenue declines. Investors will be watching closely for how the demand picture is evolving. Despite an overall decline in sales in the region, the flagship iPhone saw growth last quarter. News that the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max were the best-selling smartphones in urban China suggests that Apple's allure remains intact,\u201d Britzman said.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 1 August\n\nAmazon is under the spotlight as Morgan Stanley projects the e-commerce titan to deliver robust Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3. Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3, driven by improved profitability in North American retail and accelerated growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" Morgan Stanley analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon leverages its strong retail operations and expands its dominance in cloud computing, investors are optimistic about its financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth has also highlighted Amazon as a top pick for both the near and long term. Anmuth forecasts a near-term acceleration in AWS, predicting 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be fuelled by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetization.\n\nAnmuth also anticipates a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by improvements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are eyeing net sales between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10bn-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" noted Britzman.\n\nBank of England\u2019s interest rate decision \u2013 Thursday 1 August\n\nObviously not a stock but one of the biggest market moving decisions in the UK. Traders are increasingly betting on the Bank of England (BoE) cutting interest rates this summer, driven by optimism that the US Federal Reserve is set to reduce borrowing costs.\n\nMoney markets now indicate more than a 50% chance that Bank of England policymakers will lower rates next week, with a 92% likelihood of a cut by September.\n\n\u201cWhile softer labour market data support the rates market pricing in 12.5 bp (50%) of a 25 bp rate hike at its meeting next week, sticky inflation suggests that rates need to stay higher for longer. However, the case for a rate cut is building and is expected to be a line-ball decision,\u201d analysts at IG said.\n\nEconomists are also confident that the first interest rate cut in over four years will occur next week, according to a Reuters poll. The survey revealed that the vast majority of economists expect the BoE to reduce interest rates at their August meeting.\n\nIf the forecast is accurate, borrowing costs will decrease as the central bank-controlled interest rate drops to 5%. The current rate stands at a 16-year high of 5.25% after 14 consecutive hikes. The Reuters poll, conducted between July 18 and 24, showed that over 80% of economists (49 out of 60) anticipate the BoE will implement the rate cut.\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Plummeting This Week",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is sinking in this week's trading. The high-performance server specialist's share price was down 12.7% from last week's close heading into this Friday's market opening, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nTech stocks continued to pull back this week as investors assessed risks related to geopolitical dynamics between the U.S., China, and Taiwan. Sell-offs intensified after Alphabet and Tesla published second-quarter reports that worried Wall Street. (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news dragging Supermicro lower, the company's valuation is getting hit in a pullback that's impacting the broader market and having a particularly pronounced impact on otherwise high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The timing of the server specialist's addition to the Nasdaq-100 index also didn't help the stock this week.\n\nBearish ripple effects from earnings season hit Supermicro\n\nIn addition to geopolitical risk factors continuing to pressure growth stocks, earnings season has gotten off to a shaky start for the technology sector. Alphabet and Tesla reported Q2 earnings after the market closed on Tuesday, becoming the first of the highly influential \"Magnificent Seven\" companies to publish updated financial results. Unfortunately, Wall Street considered both reports to be duds -- and the disappointment created ripple effects that extended to Supermicro and other AI stocks.\n\nAlphabet posted per-share earnings of $1.89 on revenue of $84.74 billion, which actually came in better than the average Wall Street target's call for per-share earnings of $$1.85 on sales of $84.29 billion. But the company guided for higher costs and weaker operating income margins in Q3, and investors adopted a more bearish stance in response.\n\nTesla's quarterly report was significantly more concerning. While Q2 revenue of $25.5 billion topped the average analyst estimate by $760 million, non-GAAP (adjusted) per-share earnings of $0.52 fell short of the market's target by $0.10 per share. Comments from management about the business's near-term outlook and spending plans also worried investors.\n\nJoining the Nasdaq-100 index didn't boost Supermicro stock this week\n\nSuper Micro Computer was added to the Nasdaq-100 on July 22, and the timing of the addition may also be playing a role in this week's sell-offs. While being added to major indexes is often a bullish catalyst because it causes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to buy the stock, it's actually a negative catalyst when the underlying index level and corresponding ETF prices are dropping. For reference, the Nasdaq-100 index has fallen roughly 4.5% over the last week of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors who are eager for the next major, business-specific updates that could Supermicro's stock price won't have to wait long. The company is scheduled to report quarterly results after the market closes on Aug. 6.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Resource Stocks Positioned to Profit from Global Shortages",
        "content": "The CEO of NextEra (NYSE:NEE) recently stated that the demand for renewable energy will triple over the next seven years. Moreover, he forecasts that the overall demand for electricity will increase four times more quickly in the next 20 years compared to the previous 20 years. The CEO also expects batteries to play a key role in meeting this increased demand for electricity. Since NextEra is the owner of America\u2019s largest electrical utility, Florida Power & Light, and the world\u2019s largest producer of renewable energy, he is well-positioned to forecast the demand for renewables, electricity and energy storage. And importantly, these large increases in the utilization of renewables, electricity and energy storage will greatly increase the demand for a number of natural resources, including copper, silver and lithium. Indeed, over the long term, huge increases in the demand for these minerals could easily result in shortages of them. Here are three resource shortage stocks that are well-positioned to benefit from the latter situation.\n\nSouthern Copper (SCCO) Southern Copper Corporation logo on a phone screen in front of the logo on a computer screen. SCCO stock.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nSouthern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) has the most copper reserves in the world and predicts that it will produce a huge 935,900 tons of the metal this year. Since copper is key to solar panels and wind turbines, Southern Copper will benefit from the increases in renewable energy usage. The demand for power will also boost the demand for copper, given the metal\u2019s wide usage in electrical wiring. The metal should also surge with the proliferation of EVs, as they use more copper than their gasoline-powered counterparts.\n\nIn March, investment bank Jefferies raised its rating on Southern Copper to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold,\u201d anticipating copper shortages. The bank estimates that Southern Copper can generate free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $3 billion at March\u2019s copper prices through 2030. Copper prices are now similar to their March levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSouthern Copper\u2019s Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA ratio is now a rather low 15.4 times.\n\nSouthern Copper\u2019s leverage to the rising copper demand make it one of the best resource shortage stocks to buy now.\n\nPan American Silver (PAAS) One bar of silver has been pulled out from a larger pile.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe Wall Street Journalanticipates a 170% surge in silver usage for solar panels by 2030. Also by 2030, solar panels are expected to generate 20% of all of the demand for the metal.\n\nFurther, according to Reuters, the deficit between silver consumed and produced is expected to climb 17% this year alone. That makes Pan American Silver (NYSE:PAAS), a leading silver producer, one of the best resource shortage stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company recently reported locating \u201can entirely new set of vein structures with high silver grades\u201d at its La Colorada mine. Moreover, the company\u2019s Q2 financial results should increase with higher metals prices and more elevated silver production.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NASDAQ:ALB) is the world\u2019s largest producer of lithium.\n\nThe stock market and lithium market are failing to realize that the use of energy-storage batteries is soaring. Indeed, The Financial Timesreported last month that increased demand for these devices driving battery utilization higher. Moreover, the majority of energy-storage batteries utilize lithium.\n\nAnd in January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that the amount of energy-storage batteries deployed would almost double this year in America. Further, a major utility, Entergy (NYSE:ETR), is adding 4.5 gigawatts of battery storage capacity. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported that its energy-storage deployments had more than doubled YOY in Q2. Over time, lithium-ion energy storage batteries\u2019 increased usage will cause a surge in lithium prices.\n\nOf course, the continued growth of the EV sector will also boost lithium prices over the longer term.\n\nAnd encouragingly, Australian lithium miner Pilbara Minerals on July 23 said that the orders for its lithium were still strong while lithium prices could have bottomed due to the exit of some suppliers from the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks That Can Create Millionaires by 2030",
        "content": "In June 2010, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was listed with a market valuation of $2.23 billion. Currently, the EV maker commands a market valuation of $785 billion. During this period, the company\u2019s market valuation has increased by more than 50% CAGR. Of course, not all companies can be Tesla. However, there are millionaire-maker growth stocks to buy that can make investors rich.\n\nIf we look at Tesla\u2019s story, there are two lessons for investors. First, patience is the key to massive wealth creation. Trading good stocks is unlikely to create wealth. The key is buying and holding for the long term.\n\nFurther, there are instances of deep corrections during the journey from $2.23 billion to $785 billion. Investors need to avoid panic selling and focus entirely on the growth story and the progress in fundamentals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this overview, let\u2019s discuss seven millionaire-maker growth stocks worth considering for the next five to seven years.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe flying car industry is at a nascent stage. However, it is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2040. Early movers with good execution can undoubtedly create massive wealth. Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is an attractive bet in the eVTOL industry.\n\nFirst, I would mention that investors in Archer include Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL). The backing of blue-chip companies underscores the business\u2019s potential. Recently, Archer partnered with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) to develop operational plans for electric air taxi networks utilizing Archer\u2019s eVTOL aircraft at California airports.\n\nIn the international markets, Archer has formed partnerships in the UAE, India and Korea to commercialize eVTOL. Therefore, Archer is setting a strong base for growth in 2025 and beyond. It\u2019s worth noting that the company is also expected to complete the construction of its manufacturing facility by the end of the year. This will support the production of 650 eVTOL annually and help scale up operations.\n\nZEEKR Intelligent Technology (ZK) ZEEKR logo is seen at one of its stores in Ningbo, China. Zeekr is a premium electric automobile brand owned by the Chinese automaker, Geely Automobile Holdings. ZK stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric vehicle stocks have witnessed a significant correction due to macroeconomic headwinds, competition and trade wars. However, EV adoption will continue to increase in the coming years, and the correction is a good opportunity to accumulate quality growth stocks. ZEEKR Intelligent Technology (NYSE:ZK) is a recently listed EV company that looks promising.\n\nFor Q1 2024, ZEEKR delivered 33,059 vehicles, up 117% yearly. Revenue for the period increased by 73% to $1.1 billion. While the company reported an operating loss of $289 million, it was lower by 29% yearly. With a healthy vehicle margin and operating leverage, I expect losses to narrow further in the coming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nI must add that for the first half of the year, ZEEKR reported a 106% growth in deliveries to 87,870 vehicles. The growth is robust even amidst macroeconomic headwinds. In June, the EV company entered cooperation agreements with PT Premium Auto Prima in Indonesia and Sentinel Automotive in Malaysia. With entry into two high-potential markets, I expect robust growth to be sustained.\n\nTempus AI (TEM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American health care company Tempus Labs Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nTempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) is another new listing with multi-bagger returns potential. As an overview, Tempus AI is a healthcare technology company. In the coming years, artificial intelligence is likely to impact sectors, and Tempus is unleashing the power of AI for the healthcare industry.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s focus on research and development is yielding results. In June, the company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for Tempus ECG-AF device \u201cthat uses AI to help identify patients who may be at increased risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services granted advanced diagnostic laboratory test status for the company\u2019s next-generation sequencing assay. For the year ended December 2023, Tempus reported revenue of $531.8 million. On a year-on-year basis, revenue increased by 65.8%. As more products are launched, Tempus is positioned to accelerate growth in the coming years.\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS) Graphic of hands holding coins with growth arrows heading upward in background. hypergrowth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nGlobal defense spending hit record highs of $2.44 trillion in 2023. Considering rising geopolitical tensions, defense spending growth will likely be robust. Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) is attractive among emerging defense companies.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that DRS stock has surged by 65% in the last 12 months. I would look at corrections for fresh exposure to the stock. Considering the company\u2019s focus on innovation, I am bullish on multibagger returns.\n\nThe provider of defense electronic products and systems reported an order backlog of $7.8 billion as of Q1 2024. The order backlog has swelled by 84% year over year. A robust order intake will support revenue growth acceleration.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Leonardo reported revenue growth of 21% on a year-on-year basis to $688 million. For the same period, adjusted EBITDA was $70 million with EBITDA margin expanding by 160 basis points to 10.2%. I expect further margin expansion on operating leverage in the next few years.\n\nCronos (CRON) Cronos (CRON)\n\nSome cannabis stocks are likely to create massive wealth for investors by the end of the decade. Even without federal legalization, the U.S. cannabis market is expected to be worth $71 billion. Further, Europe has a big market for medicinal cannabis, and regulations are likely to become friendlier.\n\nCronos (NASDAQ:CRON) is a potential millionaire-maker growth stock to buy from the cannabis sector. I like that the company has been prudent in its spending. As of Q1 2024, Cronos had a cash buffer of $855 million.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Cronos was focused on Canada and Israel. However, the company has pursued geographical expansion into new markets, including Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. This is likely to support growth acceleration and improvement in EBITDA margin.\n\nWith the possibility of cannabis being reclassified as a Schedule III drug in the United States, I expect Cronos to pursue organic or acquisition-driven growth. Backed by strong fundamentals, Cronos is positioned for stellar growth and value creation.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock has skyrocketed by 215% in the last 12 months. It makes sense to wait for a correction to enter. However, there is no doubt that the company will likely deliver multi-fold revenue growth by the end of the decade.\n\nAs an overview, MakeMyTrip provides online booking solutions for the travel and tourism industry in India. By 2030, Indians are expected to be the fourth-largest global travel spenders, with spending expected to hit $410 billion. As a leading player in the industry, MakeMyTrip is positioned to benefit.\n\nFor the financial year 2024, MakeMyTrip reported the highest annual gross booking of $7.9 billion. For the same period, operating profit was $124.2 million. It\u2019s worth noting that MakeMyTrip reported an operating loss of $69.9 million in FY20. The recovery from the pandemic has been significant, and I expect healthy revenue growth coupled with margin expansion.\n\nMiniso Group Holdings (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nI believe that Miniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) is an undervalued stock that\u2019s likely to create value in the long term. The stock of the lifestyle retailer trades at a forward P/E of 14.4 and offers a dividend yield of 2.31%. With ambitious growth plans, I expect a strong reversal for MNSO stock from current levels.\n\nOne reason for MNSO being depressed is negative sentiments related to Chinese stocks. From a financial perspective, growth has been robust and should have been associated with a rally. To put things into perspective, for Q1 2024, Miniso reported revenue growth of 26% to $515.7 million. For the same period, EBITDA margin expanded by 200 basis points to 25.9%.\n\nStark growth is likely to continue in the next five years. Miniso plans to open 900 to 1,100 new stores annually between 2024 and 2028. The company has guided revenue growth at a CAGR of more than 20%. With operating leverage, the EBITDA margin is likely to be higher than current levels. Miniso is, therefore, positioned to report healthy cash flows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAs I write this, Elon Musk is grinning up at me from the Yahoo Finance homepage. He and his companies \u2014 mostly Tesla, but also SpaceX and xAI and X (formerly Twitter) \u2014 are frequent stars of the site.\n\nOne of our faithful users emailed Yahoo Finance\u2019s Rick Newman to ask why.\n\n\u201cWhy is Yahoo featuring Elon Musk every day, people are tiring of this,\u201d wrote this gentleman. Let\u2019s call him Mr. X in keeping with the theme.\n\nAs the kids say, Musk is thirsty (for attention, in this case). The question, as it is with other high-profile figures who court attention, is how we in the media react.\n\nThe thing is, Musk frequently legitimately makes news. When he says he\u2019s not donating $45 million a month to reelect former President Donald Trump. When he speaks on Tesla\u2019s earnings call and confirms that the company\u2019s robotaxi day will be delayed. And when he asks users on X whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into his AI venture. These are material events \u2014 for his public and private companies, and, for that matter, for the US.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say everything Musk says or does is newsworthy. But, let\u2019s be honest, people like a show. And we have ways of measuring just how much.\n\nAs Rick wrote to Mr. X in response, \u201cThing is \u2014 we know Tesla is one of our audience\u2019s favorite stocks.\u201d\n\nI asked our Jared Blikre to crunch the numbers, and indeed Tesla is the second-most-searched ticker on Yahoo Finance this year, behind only Nvidia. People either own it, are thinking about owning it, are regretting not owning it a few years ago, or are just curious to read about the company.\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t they?\n\nPutting aside the headline-grabbing controversies for a minute, Tesla is:\n\na dominant EV maker and a proxy for the industry that\u2019s going through a complicated transition period the owner of a promising energy storage business \u2014 another area of innovation a pioneer of self-driving technology, warts and all doing something with AI, the dominant force driving the stock market. priced at a bananas valuation that cements it as a faith-based stock with its fortune hanging on a successful turn of the cards by its robotaxi program, as we wrote a couple of weeks ago. As Elon even said this week, if you\u2019re not on board with that, sell.\n\nFor Tesla and Musk himself, you could reasonably conclude there\u2019s a mutually beneficial relationship with the media. He gets his attention, and we have something to talk about. The attention may not always be financially beneficial, though: A study earlier this year found Musk\u2019s behavior might be costing him Tesla customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr. X, hopefully that helps explain the seeming Muskfest on Yahoo Finance. And also helps clarify why it\u2019s probably not changing anytime soon.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "title": "7 EV and Renewable Energy Stocks to Stock Up on Before Rate Cuts",
        "content": "Predicting rate cuts in 2024 has been exceedingly difficult. Yet here in late July it looks increasingly likely that cuts could come as soon as September. Inflation is improving and the labor market is in better balance. That has led top Fed officials to say they are optimistic about a shorter path to lowered borrowing rates. Cheaper lending will spur all kinds of economic activity which should benefit\u00a0 all sectors, especially EVs and renewable energy stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the great majority of those stocks continue to be undervalued. That suggests there is an opportunity to buy at cheap prices in anticipation of rate cuts. Once those rate cuts occur, it should serve to boost shares in those downtrodden sectors.\n\nA medium-term perspective on electric vehicle stocks seems warranted: Global sales volumes are predicted to more than double between 2023 and 2027. Meanwhile, renewables look equally interesting. Subsidies and decarbonization demand pull will catalyze continued growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe renewables sector has been particularly hard hit by rate hikes. That alone suggests it\u2019s highly worth considering as cuts loom on the horizon. Let\u2019s take a look at several stocks worth investing in across those respective sectors.\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is always an interesting stock to follow because it is so valuable and there are so many factors that move its share price. The company is run by one of the most dynamic business people globally in Elon Musk. It\u2019s also one of the most important EV manufacturers globally. Furthermore, the company is heavily involved in artificial intelligence. In short, there are many catalysts to consider in judging the company at any given time.\n\nRate cuts are one of those factors. The impact of interest rate hikes can be seen across Tesla\u2019s financial statements. All liabilities can broadly be thought of as debt. companies must pay back their liabilities in the short-term and over the long term. The point I want to make here is that Tesla\u2019s liabilities have increased with higher lending rates.\n\nConversely, liabilities should decrease as rate cuts are implemented. Beyond that, more consumers will then be likely to buy Teslas\u00a0 as the broad macroeconomic effects of lower rates spur the economy upward.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is a legitimate challenger to Tesla for global dominance of the electric vehicle sector. It has swapped positions with Tesla as the leader in EV market share over the past few years. That has made it one of the top EV stocks overall.\u00a0 At the same time, BYD has suffered during the most recent period of quantitative tightening.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt will benefit greatly once rate cuts are implemented. Let me give you a broad, powerful reason why BYD is such a strong investment. The simple fact is that electric vehicles enjoy strong pricing advantages over their internal combustion counterparts. Compare BYD\u2019s 21% gross margin with that of Ford (NYSE:F), for example, at 8.5%. It perfectly illustrates the idea that the EV business model is much better overall. It\u2019s a big part of the reason why so many investors like EV stocks. High gross margins create all kinds of favorable internal economics that better reward investors.\n\nAs BYD continues to grow and further establish its leading position in the market, those internal economics will improve.\n\nNextracker (NXT) solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.\n\nSource: chuyuss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) is a strong renewable energy stock overall and one that should continue to perform well. The company provides solar tracker and software solutions for utility-scale and distributed generation solar projects in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe renewable energy sector was particularly hard hit by rate hikes and solar stocks in particular took a big hit all of last year. Increased lending costs at all kinds of knock-on effects across the renewable sector.\n\nAs rates dropped the opposite should be true. Nextracker, though, is already performing\u00a0 very strongly. 2024 revenues grew by 31%, reaching $2.5 billion. The company ended its fiscal year on March 31 and saw strong momentum to end 2024. Revenue growth reached 42% in the fourth quarter. The company reported GAAP\u00a0 net income of $496 million during the fiscal year 2024. GAAP net income reached $223 million in Q4 suggesting a strong momentum in terms of overall profitability. The company is well positioned to take advantage of continued solar growth whether prompted by AI or other factors. It\u2019s a well-run company overall which is probably the best reason to invest.\n\nBeam Global (BEEM) Photorealistic illustration of miniature electric vehicle (EV) charger on top of smart phone against flat bright orange background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Black_Kira\n\nBeam Global (NASDAQ:BEEM) is a stock representing a company operating at the intersection of electric vehicles and renewable energy.\n\nThe company\u2019s main product is the EV ARC, a solar-powered EV charging station. It\u2019s an off-grid portable charging option ideal for remote locations. It generates its own electricity through solar panels providing clean energy for EV charging. Beam Energy has a focus on sustainability and integrating renewable energy sources into EV charging infrastructure.\n\nAs you can see, Beam Global is an excellent example of companies that sit at the intersection of the renewable energy and EV sectors.\n\nThe company also seems to have a momentum on its side at the moment. Beam Global just began shipping its EV ARC technology in Europe. The company concurrently announced that Q2 purchase orders grew by a record 128%, reaching $10.6 million. More than half of its EV ARC orders in Q2 are from new customers suggesting it may be entering a period of rapid growth.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is like any other stock in that investors want to know how well the company is using debt.\n\nThe answer is that Enphase Energy appears to be using debt responsibly. That\u2019s a strong reason to invest as rate cuts loom. Of course, Enphase Energy\u2019s end market is residential so it isn\u2019t positioned to benefit from the positive effects of AI on the solar market. That aside, let\u2019s get back to the debt argument because it favors Enphase Energy as an investment.\n\nOn March 31, Enphase Energy had approximately $1.3 billion in debt on its balance sheet. The company also had $1.6 billion in cash at that time. Enphase Energy could wipe out all of its debt if the company wanted to. The company is much, much more likely to refinance some of that debt in the future when rates fall. Regardless, it all suggests that Enphase Energy is running balanced operations. $97 million of the company\u2019s overall debt is current, meaning it\u2019s due in 12 months or less. The $300 million cash buffer means it\u2019s safe. Look for the company to renegotiate the bulk of its debt \u2013 which is long term \u2013 as rates fall.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) the solar edge logo on an iPhone. SEDG stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) is an interesting renewable energy stock at the moment because it offers a blend of pros and cons. Ultimately, I think it\u2019s a buy because its cons are not particularly serious and its pros are attractive.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies has historically been a company that operates well in relation to debt. The company has generally been able to utilize equity to fund its operations rather than debt. That shows up on the balance sheet as a debt to shareholders equity ratio below one. And while SolarEdge Technologies continues to boast a ratio below one, the company does have some concerns. The company posted a gross profit loss in the first quarter. Operational losses also occurred in the first quarter. That\u2019s concerning because the company was not producing earnings to fund operations. If that were to continue, SolarEdge would have to consider issuing debt to fund operations.\n\nYet, SolarEdge has real opportunities that continue to outweigh the negatives. The debt ratio mentioned above is still healthy for one. Furthermore, SolarEdge is positioned to take advantage of the AI opportunity as a commercial and utility scale solar firm. Thirdly, rate cuts should spur all kinds of external and internal catalysts that position it well otherwise.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) continues to be a strong chip stock in the EV sector that investors should consider. The company, like all others, should benefit from the broad, positive effects of rate cuts.\n\nON Semiconductor benefits from a strong presence in the automotive semiconductor market, which is expected to grow significantly due to EVs. ON Semiconductor is also a leader in Silicon Carbide (SiC)\u00a0 technology, a crucial material for next-generation power electronics in EVs. SiC technology offers advantages like higher efficiency and faster charging times compared to traditional silicon. The company very recently played up that opportunity in a press release promoting its innovation efforts in the SiC sector.\n\nON Semiconductor continues to be essentially flat from a fundamental and operational perspective. The company is sort of wading along in anticipation of future EV growth. Shares are expected to appreciate in price in the future and now is a good time to consider stocking up on shares in anticipation of rate cuts and an EV rebound.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 335% to $3 Trillion, According to a Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, recently told CNBC that Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is on pace to be a $3 trillion company. Munster highlighted opportunities related to artificial intelligence (AI), like full self-driving software and robotaxi services as key growth drivers.\n\nHis prediction lacks a specific timeline, but a $3 trillion valuation implies a 335% upside from Tesla's current market capitalization of $687 billion.\u00a0Here's what investors should know.\n\nTesla continued to struggle with waning demand in the second quarter\n\nTesla reported disappointing financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased a meager 2% to $25.5 billion, narrowly topping expectations. But GAAP net income nosedived 45% to $1.5 billion, missing estimates for the fourth consecutive time. The company has now recorded a profit margin below 6% in back-to-back quarters, something that hasn't happened in more than three years.\n\nOn the bright side, demand for electric vehicles (EVs) should improve as the macroeconomic climate becomes more favorable for consumers. The catalyst for that turnaround could come later this year. Pricing data from futures contracts implies three 25 basis-point rate cuts in 2024. Specifically, investors believe the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark interest rate at meetings in September, November, and December.\n\nAdditionally, while Tesla has lost share in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) this year, the company remains a formidable player. In the U.S., Tesla accounted for 48% of BEV sales through May, topping the next closest competitor by 40 percentage points. Globally, Tesla accounted for 16% of BEV sales through May, trailing the industry leader BYD by less than 1 percentage point.\n\nTesla may be an artificial intelligence company disguised as an automaker\n\nThe bull case for Tesla says its core electric-vehicle business is a stepping stone to bigger opportunities in software and services, especially those related to artificial intelligence. Full self-driving (FSD) software is the cornerstone of that narrative. In theory, FSD will support direct monetization via subscription and licensing, and indirect monetization via autonomous ride-hailing (robotaxi) services.\n\nIn 2023, CEO Elon Musk told CNBC's David Faber that robotaxis could push Tesla's gross margin toward 70%. That would be a dramatic increase in profitability, compared to its gross margin of 18% in the most recent quarter. Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley believes Tesla could be a \"formidable player (if not an outright winner) in the race to autonomy,\" due to its strong presence in the electric-vehicle market, which itself has given rise to a material data advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla uses its vast network of FSD-enabled vehicles to source video data, and that data is used to train and improve the underlying machine-learning models. Tesla has data from over 1.3 billion miles driven in FSD, and Ark Invest estimates the company is accumulating data 110 times more quickly than Alphabet subsidiary Waymo, its primary competitor.\n\nGene Munster believes FSD could generate $100 billion in annual operating income through subscription and licensing fees within a decade. Tesla doesn't currently license its FSD software, but Musk, on the recent earnings, call told analysts: \"There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving, and I suspect there will be more over time. But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.\"\n\nThe Dojo supercomputer is another potential revenue stream related to artificial intelligence. Dojo features custom chips purpose-built for video training that should accelerate FSD development. Taiwan Semiconductor recently confirmed those custom chips are in production, and Musk believes Dojo could be competitive with Nvidia-based systems in the future. With proof of concept, Tesla could monetize Dojo by selling AI cloud services to other businesses.\n\nMore importantly, Dojo is tailormade for AI vision systems, so it should help the company more quickly train the machine-learning models that power its FSD software. Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley discussed that idea in a note to clients: \"In its quest to solve for autonomy, Tesla has developed an advanced supercomputing architecture that pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10 trillion total addressable market.\"\n\nTesla plans to unveil its robotaxi at a company event scheduled for Oct. 10. On the earnings call, Musk fielded a question about when Tesla expects the first robotaxi ride. He said: \"Possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.\"\n\nTesla could be a $3 trillion company by 2034\n\nWall Street expects Tesla to grow revenue and earnings per share at annual rates of 16% and 25%, respectively, through 2026. Those estimates seem too pessimistic, perhaps due to macroeconomic uncertainty and skepticism about Tesla's ability to pivot toward software and services.\n\nI think Tesla could grow earnings by 30% annually over the next decade. I say that because electric-vehicle sales are projected to increase at 33% annually through 2030, and the robotaxi market is forecast to expand at 53% annually through 2032.\n\nIf Tesla does grow earnings at 30% annually over the next decade, the stock could certainly appreciate by 16% annually over the same period, carrying its market capitalization to $3 trillion by mid-2034.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The recent price weakness in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) following its latest quarterly report presents a buying opportunity, Argus analysts said in a Friday note.\n\n\u201cDespite posting a softer-than-expected second quarter, we remain supportive of the company's strategy and believe future prospects remain robust,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nAmong the key reasons behind its bullish thesis is Tesla\u2019s commentary about its plans to start production of a new low-cost affordable EV model, in the price range of $25,000 to $30,000.\n\n\u201cWe view this development as a positive step forward that should enable TSLA to maintain, and potentially expand, their EV dominance,\u201d they noted.\n\nArgus believes that despite several near-term industry and operational challenges, Tesla will manage to navigate these issues and maintain its position as the market leader in the EV market.\n\nThey also expect the company to benefit from tax credits for EV purchases under last year's Inflation Reduction Act, as well as from increased semiconductor supplies and moderating raw-material cost inflation.\n\nAlthough EV sales have moderated in recent months both in the U.S. and globally, the investment research firm views the long-term trend for EV sales as strong.\n\nIn terms of valuation, analysts find Tesla stock attractive at current levels, emphasizing that it should not be valued as a \"plain-old car company\" as it encompasses \u201csignificantly much more than that.\u201d \r\n\r\n\"In addition to manufacturing EVs, Tesla is also dedicated to energy storage, self-driving technology, and advanced robotics,\u201d analysts added.\n\nOn July 23, after the closing bell, Tesla reported an adjusted Q2 2024 net profit of $1.812 billion or $0.52 per diluted share, down from $3.148 billion or $0.91 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.\n\nEarnings, alongside auto margins, fell short of expectations, sending the company\u2019s shares tumbling 12% in the after-hours trade.\n\nArgus lowered its 2024 EPS estimate for Tesla to $2.45 from $2.57, which is still above the current consensus projection of $2.35. The firm also cut their 2025 EPS estimate to $3.32 from $3.51 \u201cto reflect weaker demand trends in the EV industry, which we believe is a temporary situation.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRecent price weakness in Tesla stock is a buying opportunity: Argus\n\nRain may help firefighters battling blaze in Canadian tourist town\n\nApple stock now seen as 'a more stable AI play for volatile times'\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Thursday as heavyweight technology stocks appeared to be easing from bruising losses in recent sessions, with focus turning to key upcoming inflation data.\n\nFutures rose after Wall Street endured another mostly negative session, following some disappointing major tech earnings earlier this week. But the pace of losses in tech stocks now appeared to be slowing.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.3% to 5,456.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,049.0 points by 20:16 ET (00:16 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,284.0 points.\n\nTech steadies in after-hours trade after bruising losses\n\nHeavyweight technology stocks steadied in after-hours trading after logging steep losses over the past week. Selling in tech intensified this week following underwhelming earnings from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with the latter potentially setting a precedent for earnings from other internet giants.\n\nTesla, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) all moved in a tight range. But Alphabet saw extended losses after OpenAI unveiled an artificial intelligence search engine aimed to compete directly with Google.\n\nTech earnings are set to continue in the coming week, with Microsoft and Apple due on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Prints from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also due next week.\n\nBut a sustained rout in tech saw the NASDAQ Composite close down 0.9% at 17,181.72 on Thursday- its weakest level since early-June. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to an over one-month low of 5,399.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 39,935.07 points, benefiting from some defensive buying.\n\nPCE inflation data on tap\n\nSelling in tech was also driven by increased expectations for interest rate cuts, which saw investors lock profits in the sector and pivot into stocks with more exposure to an economic recovery.\n\nPCE price index data due later on Friday is set to provide more cues on the rates front. The reading is the preferred inflation of the Federal Reserve, and is likely to factor into the central bank\u2019s stance on interest rates.\n\nThe reading comes just days before a Fed meeting next week. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates steady, while investors will be watching for any cues on when it plans to begin cutting rates.\n\nGeneral consensus is for a 25 basis point cut in September.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; PCE data awaited\n\nStory continues\n\nJuniper Networks Falls on Earnings Miss, Q2 Revenue Down 17% YoY\n\nEarnings call: Ameriprise Financial boasts record revenues of $4.2 billion\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Sell as Biden\u2019s Reelection Bid Comes to an End",
        "content": "Well, that was a stunner (though perhaps not entirely unexpected). Over the weekend, President Joe Biden made the tough, but likely necessary decision to step down from his reelection bid. It\u2019s why I\u2019m looking at some of the stocks to sell on that news.\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of time for the Democrats to mount an effective campaign against Trump. However, on paper, \u201cThe Donald\u201d and the Republicans have a more straightforward path to The White House. From the get-go, it was clear as daylight that conservatives wanted Trump as their man.\n\nThe right is getting what they want. It\u2019s just not as complicated as what the Democrats face.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn that sense, it\u2019s not imprudent to consider which investments may do well under Trump \u2013 and which may do poorly. On that note, below are stocks to sell as Biden steps out of the race.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Trump ends up taking the White House, you\u2019d have to figure that electric vehicles may be in trouble. It\u2019s possible that sector leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may be safe considering how much CEO Elon Musk supports the conservative cause. However, in a paradigm that would suddenly shift back toward the internal combustion engine, the EV space could get crowded. And that\u2019s why Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) risks becoming one of the stocks to sell.\n\nTo be sure, things are looking all that great for RIVN stock right now. During the midweek session, shares lost 7% of equity value. For now, it appears that the company has hit a market peak on July 12. In fairness, Rivian inked a deal with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), attracting significant investor interest. While the increased funding should help make Rivian\u2019s efforts into making lower-cost EVs a reality, a Trump second term could impose obstacles.\n\nPrimarily, the former president threatened to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s green energy initiatives, which includes EVs. In turn, legacy automakers may become much more relevant. Presumably, this \u201cnew\u201d source of competition may weigh on Rivian. Therefore, I would be careful.\n\nVestas Wind Systems (VWDRY) A wind turbine appears in silhouette against a bright orange and blue sky.\n\nSource: Khanthachai C / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Biden moving out of the way, Donald Trump arguably enjoys the most straightforward road to the executive office. If so, one of the stocks to sell may be Vestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWDRY). A Danish manufacturer, Vestas sells, installs and services wind turbines. It has operating manufacturing plants across the globe, including a presence in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Trump hates wind turbines. Making multiple statements against the energy source, he has repeatedly cited how ugly the infrastructure is. And yes \u2013 wind turbines do kill birds, though the number needs to be taken into a broader context.\n\nAnyways, the point isn\u2019t so much about justifying Trump\u2019s dislike for wind turbines. The man has taken aim at plenty of social dynamics, let\u2019s be honest here. However, if he wins a second term, he will almost certainly support hydrocarbon specialists. That may leave \u201cugly\u201d Vestas in the shadows.\n\nIt\u2019s just the reality of the situation: VWDRY may end up as one of the stocks to sell.\n\nSportsman\u2019s Warehouse (SPWH) Sportsman's Warehouse in Las Vegas. SPWH stock.\n\nSource: Kit Leong / Shutterstock\n\nAn ironic example of stocks to sell, Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse (NASDAQ:SPWH) will likely face challenges if Trump wins a second term. Two major problems exist. First, Americans bought a record number of guns during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis. For those that don\u2019t know, guns comprise a significant part of Sportsman\u2019s inventory.\n\nWith so many folks having already bought firearms, the need to buy more has diminished. People need to buy rice, beans and toilet paper, and that stuff has gotten expensive due to inflation. So, I don\u2019t see too many firearms being sold.\n\nThe other problem is the lack of political pressure. Barring something extraordinary, Trump isn\u2019t going to announce an assault weapons ban. No, the Second Amendment is one of the cornerstones of \u2018MAGA\u2019 conservativism. So, the most realistic scenario I see for SPWH stock is, unfortunately, down.\n\nOf course, if the Democrats gain momentum and appear on the cusp of victory, you can bet that my thesis would change. Until then, assume a red wave \u2013 and that means SPWH would be one of the stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "'I'd Prefer To Be Dead' \u2013 Elon Musk Isn't Interested In Living Forever: 'Most of the Time People Don't Change Their Mind, They Just Die'",
        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not as interested in living an eternal life as some of his fellow billionaires. He's been pretty vocal about why he doesn't think immortality would be such a great idea.\n\nIn December 2021, during the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council Summit, Elon Musk made an unexpected statement: \u201cIt is important for us to die because most of the time people don\u2019t change their mind. They just die.\u201d He explained, \u201cIf you live forever, we might become a very ossified society where new ideas cannot succeed.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nMusk believes that death moves society forward. According to him, there has to be death and rebirth in order to maintain fresh thoughts that can foster innovations.\n\nMany other billionaires are spending a fortune on longevity research just to discover how to attain a longer and healthier life. Jeff Bezos, for example, has invested in Altos Labs, a startup that specializes in cellular rejuvenation programming. The firm's goal is to apply cutting-edge science to elongate human life.\n\nAdditionally, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have joined others in looking for ways to slow down aging through Calico Labs. They want to understand why people age biologically and invent some methods that may increase their life span.\n\nSee Also: When today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.\n\nOn the other hand, PayPal's Peter Thiel, who appears obsessed with the meaning of life, signed up for a cryonic preservation service at Alcor Life Extension Foundation, thereby inserting himself into future hopes of medical revivalism. This means freezing a person's dead body or brain until later, when scientific advancements can be used to revive them. This enthusiasm from Thiel shows how some tech moguls believe that living much longer than normal is not only an aspiration but something possible within this century.\n\nWhile these billionaires pour resources into extending human life, Musk seems content with the natural order of things.\n\nIn a January 2024 podcast interview with Peter Diamandis, Musk was asked if he was striving to live to 100. Musk clarified his stance: \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to be a burden to society or have dementia and not know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d prefer to be dead.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nHe believes that extending one\u2019s life span or health span is a promising area for progress. \"My opinion on the subject is that I think it's not that hard to solve,\" Musk told Diamandis.\n\nMusk isn\u2019t opposed to maintaining good health for a longer period. He balances embracing life and accepting its natural conclusion: \u201cI certainly would like to maintain health for a longer period of time. But I am not afraid of dying.

While he values health and vitality, he also recognizes mortality\u2019s role in societal renewal and progress. This stance challenges the prevailing Silicon Valley ethos of conquering death through technology.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 25, 2024\u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022.\"\n\nWill Mag 7 Earnings Meet Expectations?\n\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nFor the 134 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 26.8% of the index's total membership, total earnings are up +7.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 57.5% beating revenue estimates. Except for the revenue beats percentage, which at 57.5% is the lowest for this group of 134 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all of the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to what we have seen in other recent periods. Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2022. Q2 earnings for the 'Magnificent 7' companies are expected to be up +26.6% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues. Excluding the 'Mag 7', Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.1% (from +9.6%).\n\nAlphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the 'Magnificent 7' stocks, with the market unimpressed with either of the two reports. This contrasted with the companies' Q1 releases when both Alphabet and Tesla were up big on the quarterly results.\n\nThere is no surprise in the Tesla sell-off, as the company not only missed estimates but also had nothing good to say about the near-term outlook. The EV maker has been suffering competitive challenges in its core market, prompting it to cut prices that are weighing on its margins. As a result, Tesla's Q2 earnings were down -45.3% on +2.3% higher revenues. Given Tesla shares' gain of more than +40% in the three-month period ahead of the quarterly release, the post-release sell-off makes perfect sense.\n\nThe sell-off in Alphabet shares is far harder to understand, as the search giant handily beat estimates and showed broadly positive trends in all of its businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe issue in the Alphabet report appears to be the market's disappointment with a bigger-than-expected capital spending level in the period of $13.2 billion relative to expectations of $12.2 billion. Management also indicated that they saw underspending as a bigger risk at this stage of the AI rollout than the alternative, which was interpreted as indicative of an elevated capex spend trend than what investors had been factoring in.\n\nWe don't see elevated capex by Alphabet or any other Tech operator as a negative, but this appears to be the case with Tech investors at this stage. Perhaps the market would like to see a tangible path toward monetization for all the AI-centric investments in which Alphabet and its peers are currently engaged in. This also means that capex spending levels in the coming Meta and Microsoft reports will similarly receive close scrutiny.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +26.6% on +13.6% higher revenues.\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +16.3% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.2%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\n\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector's positive earnings outlook is the sector's margins outlook.\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year's record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector's productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nPlease note that this year's +8.7% earnings growth on only +1.7% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.5%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +3.9%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "A string of subpar second-quarter earnings reports is hurting the stock market. The technology-laden Nasdaq index fell 3% (more than 500 points) after the initial financial results from mega-cap tech companies disappointed. However, the poor results are by no means limited to technology concerns.\n\nRestaurants, airlines, healthcare companies and some financial institutions have delivered earnings disappointments since the start of July, contributing to the market volatility that has characterized the start of the year\u2019s second half. The poor financial results have also exposed companies that are struggling under the weight of big problems and are likely to continue doing so over the near term.\n\nHere are three stocks to sell after disastrous Q2 earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs these words are being typed, Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is down 10% after the electric vehicle manufacturer reported terrible second-quarter financial results. The company announced EPS of 52 cents versus 62 cents, which was expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $25.50 billion, which was a little ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $24.77 billion. However, Tesla reported that its revenue from electric vehicle sales declined 7% year-over-year to $19.90 billion.\n\nEqually bad, Tesla reported that its profit margin declined to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla continues to struggle with declining sales and rising competition, especially in China, its second biggest market. As a result, Tesla continues to lower prices and offer discounts on its vehicles, which has hurt the company\u2019s finances and margins. Earlier this year, Tesla\u2019s share of the U.S. electric vehicle market fell below 50% for the first time, continuing a downward trend.\n\nTSLA stock has declined 18% over the last 12 months.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T\u2019s (NYSE:T) Q2 print wasn\u2019t much to like. The telecommunications giant\u2019s results fell short of Wall Street estimates due to a decline in its fiber-optic business. The company reported an EPS of 57 cents, which aligned with Wall Street forecasts but was down 10% from a year earlier. Revenue came in at $29.80 billion, down 0.4% from a year earlier and slightly below estimates that called for sales of $29.98 billion.\n\nWhile AT&T reported its second consecutive quarter of better-than-expected landline phone subscribers, it continues to see an erosion in its fiber-optic internet unit. The company added 239,000 fiber-optic customers in Q2, which was below the 248,600 analysts had forecast. The company maintained its full-year guidance, calling for earnings of $2.15 to $2.25 per share and broadband revenue growth of about 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nT stock has been a chronic underperformer, down 26% over the last five years.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCredit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) posted uncharacteristically bad Q2 results, sending its stock down 4%. The company announced an EPS of $2.42 for its fiscal third quarter, matching Wall Street forecasts. Revenue of $8.90 billion was slightly below analyst estimates of $8.92 billion. Visa said that its payment volume rose 7% while its processed transactions increased 10%.\n\nUnfortunately, those numbers were down from 8% growth in payment volumes and 11% growth in processed transactions in the previous quarter. Despite the disappointing results and slowdown, Visa reiterated its forward guidance that calls for full-year double digit revenue growth. V stock is up 6% over the last 12 months, trailing the 20% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Traders bet there is a 50pc chance that Andrew Bailey and his fellow policymakers at the Bank of England will cut interest rates next week - Yui Mok/Pool via REUTERS\n\nTraders are ramping up bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates this summer amid optimism that the US Federal Reserve is poised to begin reducing borrowing costs in America.\n\nMoney markets indicate there is more than a 50pc chance that policymakers will cut rates in Britain next week - with a 92pc chance of them doing so by September.\n\nTraders began ramping up bets on a summer rate cut today, up from a 45pc chance on Wednesday, as money markets indicated a rate cut in the US was becoming more likely.\n\nData today showed an unexpected slowdown in consumer spending on durable goods like cars and washing machines, dropping by 6.6pc despite predictions it would rise by 0.3pc.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe figures cemented bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September, which is now fully priced in.\n\nMoney markets showed confidence in rate cuts despite official figures showing the American economy expanded faster than expected in the second quarter of the year.\n\nUS GDP grew by 2.8pc in the three months to June, according to the Commerce Department, which was much faster than the 2pc that had been predicted by analysts.\n\nStephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe sharper-than-expected pick-up in second-quarter GDP growth to 2.8pc annualised should make the Fed a bit more comfortable about keeping policy unchanged next week, but the recent loosening of labour market conditions and signs of slower price growth still mean that there is a strong case for a cut at the following meeting in September.\u201d\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:09 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today.\n\nChris Price will be back in the morning before London\u2019s markets open, but I\u2019ll leave you with our report that an exodus of paying viewers has sparked soul-searching at the BBC.

Jonathan Leake reports:\n\nStory continues\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Maier, a British-Austrian businessman who previously headed up wind turbine producer Siemens UK, has been chosen by the Energy Secretary to chair the company and accelerate Britain\u2019s renewable electricity programme.\n\nMr Maier warned before Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union that quitting would hit the country\u2019s economy like a \u201cslow puncture\u201d, making it far harder for British companies to export their products.\n\nHe used the phrase in a Guardian interview in 2020, following it up with a post on his personal website which argued that closer ties with the EU would be vital in the coming years \u2013 and suggesting the country could even go back into the single market.\n\nAt the time, Mr Maier wrote that repairing the alleged economic damage \u201cwill only be possible by creating more alignment and not less, as some key Brexit promoters are arguing for post Brexit\u201d.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:53 PM BST\n\nCar giant Stellantis could axe brands\n\nStellantis, the owner of 14 car brands including Vauxhall, Maserati and Fiat, could axe one or more of its brands if they fail to deliver a profit, chief executive Carlos Tavares has said.\n\nThe warning for lossmaking brands is a turnaround for Mr Tavares, who has maintained since Stellantis was created in 2021 that all of its 14 brands have a future.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t make money, we\u2019ll shut them down,\u201d Carlos Tavares told reporters after the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker delivered worse-than-expected first-half results, sending its shares down as much as 10pc.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to have brands that do not make money.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, he said that \u201cthere\u2019s absolutely no taboo\u201d if their performance deteriorated. \u201cIf they are not able to monetise the value that they represent, then decisions will come.\u201d The production line for Fiat Grande Panda electric cars in Serbia this month - Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg\n\n05:37 PM BST\n\nLuxury group Hermes outshines rivals with strong profits\n\nFrench luxury group Hermes has reported strong sales and profit for the first half of the year, outshining rivals hit by a slowdown in the key Chinese market.\n\nSales reached \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.3bn) in the first six months of 2024, up 12 percent from the period last year.\n\nNet profit rose 6.4pc to \u20ac2.4bn.\n\nAxel Dumas, executive chairman, said:\n\nThe solid first-half results, in a more complex economic and geopolitical context, reflect the strength of Hermes\u2019 model.\n\nLouis Vuitton and Dior owner LVMH, the world\u2019s biggest luxury group, said earlier this week that its net profit slid 14pc to \u20ac7.3bn in the first half.\n\nAnother major French group, Gucci owner Kering, said on Wednesday that its half-year net profit fell by half and warned that operating earnings for the second half of the year would be down around 30 percent.\n\nBritish brand Burberry and Cartier owner Richemont both reported last week sharp drops in sales in China.

        "content": "A recent quarterly earnings report from Tesla resulted in a lot -of media coverage surrounding the company's financials and, frankly, its role in the future of the electric vehicle industry.\n\nBut Tesla has a lot of irons in the fire and CEO Elon Musk has been stressing the importance of the company\u2019s ambitions when it comes to autonomous vehicles and other technologies \u2013 including AI.\n\nOne much publicized form factor of AI for Tesla has been the design and development of humanoid robots. Dubbed Optimus, the Tesla bot has been in the works for years, and earlier projections from Musk had the robots, designed to take on tedious tasks in factories, rolling out soon \u2013 specifically in Tesla factories by the end of 2024 and being delivered to other companies by 2025.\n\nMost Read on IEN:\n\nGM\u2019s Weird Robotaxi Is Going on the Shelf John Deere Ends Support of 'Social or Cultural Awareness' Events Missed Rock on Chart Causes $1.4M in Damages to Barge Aircraft Prototype Can Now Fly at Unlimited Speeds\n\nThough it\u2019s largely been drowned out by the noise of Tesla\u2019s recent financials \u2013 a 44% dip in quarterly profits despite a 2% increase in revenue \u2013 it appears Tesla has quietly pushed back the timeline on Optimus.\n\nAs reported by Electrek, instead of rolling out the bots in Tesla factories this year \u2013 a timeline Musk attested to just a few months back \u2013 the Optimus humanoids will go into \u201clow production\u201d for internal use at Tesla next year. Subsequently, the \u201chigh production\u201d of the bots, for selling to other companies, is now targeted for 2026.\n\nThis represents a delay of about a year. And while it\u2019s not exactly unusual for Tesla \u2013 or any company these days \u2013 to get behind schedule on emerging technologies, it\u2019s also true that Tesla has bet a lot on diversifying its business model in a shift away from solely selling vehicles. In fact, in an April call with analysts, Musk said that instead of a car maker, \u201cTesla should be thought of as an AI robotics company.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, it seems that Optimus will have a lot to prove \u2013 when we finally see it hit the market.\n\nIn a recent post on X, the Musk-owned social media platform, he said the bots would be \u201cgenuinely useful\u201d when they roll out, though observers are right to be skeptical as to when that will actually be. As The Guardian points out, Musk suggested back in 2021 that the bots would be ready for Tesla plants the following year.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Musk to discuss $5 billion xAI investment with Tesla board",
        "content": "By Hyunjoo Jin and Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) -Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday he and the board of the electric vehicle company will discuss making a $5 billion investment in his artificial intelligence startup xAI, fueling concerns about a conflict of interest.\n\nMusk, the world's richest person, launched xAI last year in a bid to compete with Microsoft-backed OpenAI. That sparked concerns he may allocate some resources of the automaker to the AI company.\n\nMany Musk fans have supported the idea: On Tuesday, Musk launched a poll asking users on social media platform X whether Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI. More than two-thirds of nearly 1 million respondents voted in favor. It is not clear how many are Tesla investors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe poll came shortly after Tesla said its second-quarter automotive gross margin and profit fell short of Wall Street estimates on Tuesday as the company cut prices and offered incentives to boost sales.\n\n\"Looks like the public is in favor. Will discuss with Tesla board,\" Musk said in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nDuring Tesla's earning conference call on Tuesday, Musk said xAI would be \"helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center,\" adding that there are opportunities to integrate xAI's chatbot, Grok, with Tesla's software.\n\nDespite a frenzy of investment, most AI firms are still working out business models while spending heavily on technology.\n\n\"It's hard to make a claim that this is in the best interest of their Tesla shareholder,\" said Brent Goldfarb, a business school professor at the University of Maryland, who said it amounted to a transfer of Tesla wealth.\n\n\"In AI in general, nobody is quite sure where the money is going to be made and who is going to pay for it. AI right now has all the signs of a bubble,\" he said.\n\nIn 2018, Musk left OpenAI, which he co-founded because of a potential future conflict with Tesla, which is developing AI software for self-driving vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk said in April that xAI is hiring some engineers from Tesla to retain talent in the face of recruiting by Open AI.\n\nMusk's xAI raised $6 billion in a series B funding in May, fetching a post-money valuation of $24 billion. Its investors include Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital.\n\nMusk has previously said he plans for a quarter of xAI to be owned by investors in X, which he bought for $44 billion. The social media firm's value has plunged since then.\n\nMusk previously has faced criticism over potential conflicts of interest among the many companies he owns and runs. Some Tesla shareholders alleged the 2016, $2.6 billion acquisition of struggling rooftop solar company, SolarCity, founded by Musk and his cousins, amounted to a bailout. Last year, however, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a ruling that Musk did not push the electric carmaker to overpay for SolarCity.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Paul Katie in New York; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli, Peter Henderson and Daniel Wallis)",

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Sell Because JD Vance Likes Old-Fashioned Cars",
        "content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently unveiled his pick for vice president. At 39 years old, Ohio Senator JD Vance is a fresh face in Washington D.C. Despite being one of the most prominent millennial generation politicians out there, however, Vance holds surprisingly anti-electric vehicle sentiments.\n\nIn fact, Vance has suggested the EV proponents are hypocrities, since EV cars are sometimes charged via dirty power sources such as coal. In fact, Vance said \u201cThe whole EV thing is a scam.\u201d\n\nVance has proposed some measures which would greatly harm the EV sector, such as subsidizing gas-powered cars. And it\u2019s worth considering that Vance isn\u2019t alone in his views. Trump has announced plans to end the so-called electric vehicle mandate on day one of his administration if he is elected.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll this makes it a perilous time to own EV stocks. These three in particular could end up in trouble this November.\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has recently given Donald Trump a high-profile endorsement. It\u2019s unclear if this will work out well for Musk. Both Trump and JD Vance seem intent on slowing down the EV industry\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nPotential Tesla buyers also may recoil at buying a car from a company openly involved in the political scene.\n\nTesla is one of the largest players of EV stocks. And its international diversification helps shelter it somewhat from a U.S. government with an anti-electric vehicle agenda.\n\nStill, after its recent rally, TSLA stock is now selling for almost 100 times forward earnings. That\u2019s an awfully expensive price for an automobile company that could be heading into a rough political environment.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe electric vehicle industry as a whole could face harsh consequences if the Trump/Vance ticket wins in November. Chinese EV makers are likely to face an especially tough blow.\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) initially was billed as the Tesla-killer, at least in the Chinese market. While Nio has always struggled with profitability, it was able to grow revenues quickly for the past few years.\n\nWith the Chinese economy\u2019s slump, however, Nio has stalled out. Its vehicle sales fell year-over-year in Q1. Meanwhile, the company incurred an alarming $728 million net loss last quarter alone.\n\nIf that seems bad, just wait until Trump potentially returns to the White House. He\u2019s taken aim at Chinese cars specifically, vowing to curtail their sales in an attempt to bolster domestic U.S. vehicle manufacturing. Needless to say, this would be another blow to an already struggling Nio.\n\nStory continues\n\nXPeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nXPeng (NYSE:XPEV) is another Chinese electric vehicle company that could face massive ramifications from a Trump/Vance presidency.\n\nUnlike Nio, XPeng has stayed more under the radar and has gradually built up quite a business for itself. It brought in $4.3 billion in revenues in 2023, and is on pace for more than 40% growth this year despite the Chinese vehicle market\u2019s slump.\n\nDespite that, however, it is increasingly hard for XPeng to fight off all the negative political and regulatory headwinds. In addition to all the saber-rattling from Trump and Vance, there are other concerns.\n\nThe European Union appears set to start slapping tariffs on Chinese vehicles. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration just hit the Chinese vehicle makers with a hefty tariff on batteries and rare earth materials. While XPeng is trying to make the most of a challenging situation, the outlook for XPEV stock, and EV stocks in general, is cloudy, at best, in the months to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tesla TSLA and Alphabet GOOGL kicked off the Q2 reporting cycle for the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks, sparking a huge sell-off in the technology sector and the Nasdaq Composite Index. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6% or 654 points, marking its biggest percentage decline since October 2022 and its biggest points decline in more than four years, respectively. The rout wiped out about $1 trillion in market capitalization from the tech-heavy index.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks lost more than $750 billion in market cap, the most on record for the group as other mega-caps also tumbled. Meta Platforms (META) declined 5.6%, Microsoft (MSFT) slid 3.6% and Apple (AAPL) dropped 2.9%.\n\nTesla, Google Spoil Mood\n\nTesla stock plunged 12.3% to record its worst day since 2020 on weaker-than-expected results and a big drop in auto revenues. The electric automaker continued its losing earnings streak for the fourth consecutive quarter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw the biggest one-day drop since Jan 31, declining 5% following its quarterly results. Although Alphabet surpassed earnings and revenue estimates, YouTube advertising revenues came in below the consensus estimate (read: Google Heavy ETFs in Focus Following Upbeat Q2 Earnings).\r\n\r\nThis had a ripple effect on the other players in the tech space, underscoring that the wave of AI might be cooling. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) dropped 9.1%, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 6.8%, and Broadcom (AVGO) lost 7.6%.\n\nETF Impact\n\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS, an equal-weighted index of the seven companies, tumbled 6.1%, representing its largest drop since it began trading in April 2023. This decline dragged the ETF into correction territory, as MAGS is down about 12% since Jul 10. MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, which offers exposure to 10 highly traded growth stocks of next-generation technology and tech-enabled companies, also dropped 6%.\r\n\r\nYieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF TSLY, an actively managed fund that seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on Tesla, plummeted 10%. Simplify Volt Robocar Disruption and Tech ETF VCAR and YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF AIYY lost about 8% each. \r\n\r\nVCAR is an actively managed fund and employs a call option overlay to seek boosts in performance during extreme moves up in Tesla while holding a tech index for diversification and put options as a hedge. AIYY is also an actively managed fund that seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on AI (read: ETFs in Focus Post Tesla's Mixed Q2 Results). \r\n\r\nARK Innovation ETF ARKK was down 6.4% on the day. This actively managed fund invests in companies that benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvements and advancements in scientific research related to the areas of DNA Technologies and Genomic Revolution, Automation, Robotics, Energy Storage, Artificial Intelligence, Next Generation Internet and Fintech Innovation. Tesla occupies the top spot with 14.5% in the fund\u2019s basket. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF NVDY, an actively managed fund that seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on Nvidia, saw a decline of 5.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead?\n\nAfter dismal results from Tesla and Google, investors are keen to watch closely the quarterly reports of other big names in the coming weeks. Microsoft is scheduled to report on Jul 30, followed by Meta Platforms, Apple and Amazon (AMZN) later in the week. NVIDIA, the biggest beneficiary of AI spending, will be the last to report on Aug 28.\r\n\r\nPer the Zacks Earnings Trend report, second-quarter earnings of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up 26.6% from the same period last year on 13.6% higher revenues. Beyond the Mag 7, second-quarter earnings of the technology sector as a whole are expected to be up 16.3% from the same period last year. The revision trend for the tech sector has been positive for a while now. The sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock fell 12% on Wednesday after the company posted weaker-than-expected profits and signaled slower growth in its traditional auto business.\n\nBut to CEO Elon Musk, investors really need to answer only one question when it comes to judging what the stock is worth.\n\n\"The value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy,\" Musk said when asked on the company's conference call Tuesday about how the potential for fewer electric vehicle tax credits could impact Tesla's business. \"These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy.\"\n\nMusk added that anyone who doesn't believe the company will solve vehicle autonomy should \"sell their Tesla stock.\"\n\n\"If you believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock,\" Musk said. \"And all these other questions are in the noise.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk waves as he leaves the Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars in Gruenheide near Berlin, Germany, on March 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla also announced it will reveal plans for its much-hyped robotaxi on Oct. 10, a two-month delay from its initial Aug. 8 plans. Elsewhere on the call, Musk approvingly cited research from Ark Invest that said the eventual market cap for the service would land somewhere in the trillions.\n\n\"At that point, I'm not sure what money even means,\" Musk said.\n\nBut in the short term, money still means something, especially to investors who dumped the stock on Wednesday and Wall Street analysts who questioned Musk's idealistic tone on the company's earnings call.\n\n\"We believe any payoff from such initiatives are further out, so on earnings updates, the realities of the business fall back to (mostly) auto,\" UBS Investment Bank analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nSpak reasons that the value of Tesla's auto and energy business means the stock is likely worth about $74 a share, or about one-third of its current price.\n\nBut if stock valuations are a number today multiplied by a story about tomorrow, Musk has consistently chosen the most appealing \u2014 and interesting \u2014 story to tell investors.\n\nA strategy that helps explain why Musk's auto company trades at a significant premium to any other company in the sector.\n\nFor Musk's crowd of retail investors, the bolder the bet, the more enthusiastic the response. On Wall Street, analysts who can't properly plug Musk's vision into a financial model may struggle to keep pace.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd even if autonomy presents investors with an \"in or out\" conundrum, the biggest opportunity for Tesla may even lie elsewhere in the business.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk said the potential total addressable market for Tesla's Optimus robot, which has yet to hit the market, is one for every person on Earth (read: 8 billion). And even that might not be a big enough goal.\n\n\"I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla [does] combined,\" Musk said.\n\n\"I think everyone on earth is going to want one. There are 8 billion people on Earth. So it's 8 billion right there. Then you've got all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more. So I suspect that the long-term demand for general-purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units.\"\n\nAnything less, to use Musk's words, is just noise.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Xpeng plans to unveil an update to its autonomous driving software next week, as the Guangzhou-based electric vehicle builder and partner of Volkswagen tries to steal a march on Tesla before the US carmaker's release of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software in mainland China.\n\nXpeng's XOS 5.2.0 advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) is scheduled for release through its over-the-air software update on July 30, the carmaker said. Senior executives and designers will shed light on how the update can make Xpeng's smart vehicles even more intelligent, capable of recognising traffic lights, turning, changing lanes and overtaking other vehicles.\n\nThe system, also dubbed the X NGP (Xpeng navigation guided pilot), is Xpeng's answer to Tesla's FSD software, which will not be tested in China until the end of 2024. It is also offered in mainland China for free, while Tesla charges US$8,000 to install FSD, on top of a US$99 monthly subscription.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nFSD has been improved from the old version in terms of self-driving capability, but the X NGP would take a different approach in achieving autonomy, Xpeng's co-founder and chief executive He Xiaopeng said on the carmaker's Weibo account.\n\nAn Xpeng showroom in Beijing. Photo: AFP alt=An Xpeng showroom in Beijing. Photo: AFP>\n\nXpeng, founded a decade ago in southern China, is recognised as China's leader in self-driving technology, with its X NGP under tests in more than 300 cities across the nation. Xpeng, along with Beijing-headquartered Li Auto and Shanghai-based Nio, are viewed as China's best responses to Tesla as their vehicles feature autonomous driving systems, digital cockpits and high-performance batteries.\n\nCars fitted with the software are also capable of self-navigation on highways. But human inter\u00advention is still required under many circumstances.\n\n\"Xpeng needs to impress as many wealthy consumers in China, who are interested in owning cars with self-driving capability, before Tesla tests its FSD here,\" said Chen Jinzhu, CEO of consultancy Shanghai Mingliang Auto Service. \"At present, Xpeng has an advantage over its American rival as it is more knowledgeable about the traffic conditions in China.\"\n\nThe carmaker, 5 per cent owned by Volkswagen, said on Monday that it had extended its collaboration with the German partner after they signed an agreement to develop systems that enhance intelligent driving abilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nProject houses in Guangzhou, where Xpeng is headquartered, and Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui province will be established to support development of electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture.\n\nAn E/E system connects all in-car electronic control units , sensors and actuators to support a smart vehicle's capabilities of self-driving, digital connectivity and infotainment.\n\nThe signing of the agreement came after both parties agreed in April to co-develop two mid-sized electric cars bearing the VW badge to tap accelerated electrification on the mainland's roads where 40 per cent of new cars are now powered by batteries.\n\nLast month, Xpeng unveiled its first model under the new Mona sub-brand, as it explores the compact car segment by taking on market leader BYD.\n\nThe company will officially launch the Mona brand next month and release the growth strategy and development plan for the product line-up.\n\nIts CEO He told an EV forum in Beijing in March models under the brand would be equipped with autonomous driving systems and priced at 100,000 yuan (US$13,828) to 150,000 yuan.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Global shares retreated on Thursday, with Tokyo's benchmark losing more than 1,300 points at one point and closing down more than 3%, as pessimism set in over a nose-dive on Wall Street.\n\nFrance's CAC 40 slipped 1.5% in early trading to 7,400.08. Germany's DAX fell 1.2% to 18,161.70, while Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.1% to 8,066.27.\n\nThe future for the S&P 500 fell 0.2% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%.\n\nU.S. stock indexes suffered their worst losses since 2022 after profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet helped suck momentum from Wall Street\u2019s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 3.3% to 37,869.51, its lowest close since April.\n\nThe recently strengthening yen, which has recovered from trading above 160 Japanese yen to the dollar earlier this month, hurts profits of Japanese exporters when they are brought back to Japan. Toyota Motor Corp. shares dropped 2.6%, while Sony Group's sank 5.4%.\n\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 152.50 yen from 153.89 yen. The euro cost $1.0844, up from $1.0841.\n\nThe yen has been gaining against the dollar largely because of speculation the Bank of Japan will raise its near-zero benchmark interest rate soon. The central bank's next policy meeting ends on July 31.\n\n\u201cThe major risk is that the BOJ might refuse to hike next week, causing the entire long yen trade to collapse. But that\u2019s probably just a bad thought,\u201d said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\nChinese shares fell as investors questioned a central bank decision to cut another key interest rate after several similar moves earlier this week.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng declined 1.7% to 17,021.91, while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.5% to 2,886.74.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi declined 1.7% to 2,710.65 after the government reported the economy contracted at a 0.2% rate in the last quarter.\n\nAmong the region\u2019s technology shares, Samsung Electronics fell nearly 2%, while Nintendo lost 2.4%. Tokyo Electron tumbled nearly 5%.\n\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 shed 1.3% to 7,861.20.\n\nWednesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.3% for its fifth drop in the last six days, closing at 5,427.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2% to 39,853.87, and the Nasdaq composite skidded 3.6% to 17,342.41.\n\nProfit expectations are high for U.S. companies broadly, but particularly so for the small group of stocks known as the \u201c Magnificent Seven.\u201d Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla need to keep delivering powerful growth after being responsible for most of the S&P 500\u2019s run to records this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla was one of the heaviest weights on the market and tumbled 12.3% after reporting a 45% drop in profit for the spring, and its earnings fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts.\n\nTesla has become one of Wall Street\u2019s most valuable companies not just because of its electric vehicles but also because of its AI initiatives, such as a robotaxi. That\u2019s a tough business to assign a value to, according to UBS analysts led by Joseph Spak, and the \u201cchallenge is that the time frame, and probability of success is not clear.\u201d\n\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 59 cents to $77.00 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 56 cents to $81.26 a barrel.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The recent tech sell-off, sparked by results from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street. However, Wedbush analysts are confident this downturn will be brief and see it as the beginning of a significant tech bull run driven by a massive AI capital expenditure cycle.\n\nAccording to Wedbush, \"We believe this tech sell-off will be short-lived as the Street better digests results and commentary from the broader tech sector over the coming weeks during earnings season.\"\n\n\"This is the start....not the end of this tech bull run in our view fueled by this AI tidal wave of spending on the doorstep,\" they argue.\n\nThe firm highlights that the sell-off, although unsettling, confirms the robust cloud and AI build-outs fueling what they describe as the \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush estimates that over $1 trillion will be spent on AI capex in the coming years by companies, utilities, and governments, which will drive this AI Revolution.\n\nAlphabet's increased spending on AI, highlighted in their recent earnings, is seen as a precursor to similar announcements from other major tech players. This substantial investment wave is not viewed as a risk but as a necessary step in building the AI ecosystem globally.\n\nDespite investor concerns about the delayed materialization of top-line growth and margins from these investments, Wedbush strongly disagrees, asserting that this confirms the AI Revolution.\n\n\"This is not Meta/Zuckerberg head scratching spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the US, China, and around the globe,\" the analysts emphasize.\n\nWedbush remains optimistic about a multi-year tech bull run, especially with a potential Fed rate cut creating a favorable risk-on environment.\n\nThey foresee tech stocks rising another 15%-20% this year, driven by strong 2Q earnings expected from companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), as well as key cybersecurity firms such as Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), Palo Alto, CyberArk, Checkpoint, and Tenable.\n\nIn conclusion, Wedbush says that massive sell-offs like yesterday spark Street nervousness, but the pullbacks have previously \"created the golden opportunities time and time again to own Big Tech and the winners.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech sell-off to be short lived; this is start of tech bull run: Wedbush\n\nBofA payments app for businesses handled record $500 billion by mid-year\n\nFutures pare losses after GDP, durable goods data\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): Why Is It One of the Best High Growth Stocks Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High Growth Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other high growth stocks.\n\nAt Wall Street, long-standing investment strategies are being reshuffled as the monetary and political landscape evolves. Reallocation is the name of the game in a week where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines of 1.97% and 3.65%, respectively, marking their largest weekly losses since April. Conversely, the Dow advanced 0.72%, and the small cap-focused Russell 2000 climbed 1.68%. A few tech mega-caps\u2014led by Apple Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., and Amazon.com, Inc.\u2014have dominated stock market returns, especially over the last 18 months, a trend that is evident in the diverging performances of the largest 50 stocks in the S&P 500, weighted by market capitalization. This trend, however, seems to have reversed sharply recently, with mega-caps selling off while the average stock holds close to record levels.\n\nInvestors are grappling with this sudden shift, and one possible explanation is that mega-caps may have become too expensive. \"The stock market is experiencing a long overdue rotation,\" said Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management. \"Investors are pulling money out of high-performing big tech stocks and reallocating it to other market areas.\" Notably, tech\u00a0giants like NVIDIA Corporation, previously popular among options traders, saw a notable shift in sentiment, with demand for bearish puts surpassing calls at the highest rate in five months. \"It signals a different regime,\" said Erika Maschmeyer, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. \"The market could be choppier and more volatile, with more dispersion than we have seen.\"\n\nThis divergence has reassured some Wall Street experts who had been concerned about the rally's dependence on a few massive tech stocks. Additionally, rising optimism about forthcoming interest rate decreases from the Fed has bolstered smaller and more cyclically oriented names. In that regard, the Fed's battle against inflation might be nearing its end after U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in June. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee considers the latest inflation data \"excellent\" and describes persistent housing inflation improvement as \"profoundly encouraging.\" However, Scott Rubner of Goldman Sachs is skeptical about buying the dip. The tactical strategist believes the S&P 500 has little room for upward movement from its current position. He points out that historically, July 17 has marked a turning point for the equity benchmark, with data dating back to 1928 supporting this claim. Rubner notes that August typically sees the worst outflows from passive equity and mutual funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn another note, the U.S. economy added slightly more jobs than expected in June. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 206,000 for the month, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 200,000 but falling short of the revised May gain of 218,000, which was significantly reduced from the initial estimate of 272,000. However, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.1%, matching the highest level since October 2021 and presenting a mixed signal for Federal Reserve officials considering their next monetary policy move. The jobless rate was forecasted to remain steady at 4%. Although June job creation exceeded expectations, much of this growth was driven by a 70,000 surge in government jobs. Additionally, the health care sector, a consistent leader, added 49,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 34,000 and construction increased by 27,000.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is heating up, with President Joe Biden opting not to run for re-election and Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump continuing his campaign after surviving an assassination attempt. Historically, presidential election years have often brought strong returns for stock investors, influencing short-term economic policy. However, recent events suggest that this election year may be far from typical.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the best high growth stocks to buy, we identified companies with strong sales growth over the past five years. These companies were then ranked based on the number of hedge fund investors in the first quarter of 2024, out of a total of 919 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nAnnual Sales Growth Over the Past 5 Years: 36.73%\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), headquartered in Austin, Texas, is a prominent American clean energy company, renowned for its electric vehicles. Tesla not only designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), but also offers energy storage solutions, solar panels, and solar shingles.\n\nThe EV giant is set to further enhance its product lineup with the anticipated launches of the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi this year. The company's energy division reported significant achievements in the first quarter of 2024, with margins reaching a record high of 24.6%. Energy storage deployments are projected to increase by at least 75% in 2024 compared to the previous year.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently reiterated its Overweight rating on the TSLA stock, maintaining a price target of $310.00. Investors are keenly anticipating continued leadership from Elon Musk, who is expected to participate in the upcoming second-quarter conference call and host a robotaxi event on August 8th in Austin. Despite potential legal challenges, Musk's influence over Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains substantial, though he has yet to secure the 25% blocking minority voting power he aims for. Morgan Stanley suggests that further purchases or strategic financial mechanisms might be required to achieve this goal, with the firm also highlighting Musk's considerable personal wealth, estimated at over $100 billion, which could serve as collateral for future transactions to increase his stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOne of the top high growth stocks to buy, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), is held by 74 hedge funds as of Q1 2024.\n\nHere\u2019s what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the Fund\u2019s underperformance this quarter stemmed from the Fund\u2019s 10-year investment in\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla\u2019s shares fell 29.3% during the period and detracted 13.41% from the Fund\u2019s first quarter results. Although Tesla has contributed importantly to the Fund\u2019s performance since 2014, on occasion it has detracted from quarterly performance. In previous instances when Tesla shares have underperformed during a discrete period, they have shortly afterwards reflected the strong growth of the underlying business and the stock has appreciated considerably. We believe that will be the case again, although cannot guarantee it.\n\nA significant decline also occurred at the end of 2022. In that instance, investors had become concerned about a host of external factors. Investors believed the company founder, visionary, and CEO Elon Musk was distracted by his acquisition of Twitter. They also believed a weak Chinese economy emerging from COVID and U.S. government policies would curtail the purchases of Tesla vehicles. These fears proved to be overblown. As the company achieved milestones in the succeeding year, the stock subsequently doubled over the next 12 months\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 6th on our list of the best high growth stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best High Growth Stocks To Buyto see the other high growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell sharply on Wednesday after the automaker reported Q2 earnings and auto margins that missed analyst expectations.\n\nThe stock plunged more than 12% on the day, erasing nearly all of its July gains.\n\nRBC Capital Markets analysts acknowledged the near-term setup for Tesla stock could be challenging and remain that way for more than 5 quarters ahead. However, analysts added they \u201csee a critical lever that Tesla has to pull that could change the narrative on the stock immediately.\n\n\u201cAnd this would be cutting the price of FSD,\u201d they highlighted.\n\nRBC notes that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) product, now priced at $99 per month, has seen a significant increase in usage.\n\nFollowing a free trial in March and a price reduction from $200 to $99 per month, cumulative miles driven surged by 60% in Q2 compared to Q1 of this year. A year ago, 400,000 Tesla customers in North America were using the FSD beta, and that number has risen substantially over the past three months.\n\n\"All that said, while FSD take rates have expanded dramatically in recent months, we estimate FSD penetration of Tesla's fleet is in the single digits,\" the analysts said.\n\nStill, other OEMs offer Level 2+ pricing much lower than Tesla's $99 per month rate, RBC pointed out.\n\nCiting its recent talks with BMW (ETR:BMWG), the investment bank learned that the German auto giant\u2019s 5-Series in California has a take rate exceeding 30% for a product priced at $2,650.\n\nAssuming a $99 per month price for Tesla's FSD, this equates to a $7,000 cost over six years. Both General Motors Company's (NYSE:GM) Supercruise and Ford's (NYSE:F) Bluecruise are similarly priced to BMW's offering. The analysts believe that if Tesla reduced its FSD price to match its competitors, it could significantly boost take rates.\n\n\"This could translate to immediately improved margins and more importantly, highlight the autonomy narrative and multiple on Tesla shares instantly, instead of waiting for robotaxis,\" they said. \"It could also highlight the potential for Tesla to license FSD to other OEMs.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIs there a reason to own Tesla stock near term given the headwinds?

        "content": "You Could Have Turned $500 Into More Than $50,000 In One Day As Market Got Clobbered: Here's How\n\nWednesday was the worst day for the overall market in 2024, with the SPDR S&P 500 Index (NYSE:SPY) trading down more than 2% and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NYSE:QQQ) trading down more than 3.5% late in the session.\r\n\r\nMany mega-cap tech names that have driven much of the last year's rally sold off significantly on the day, with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) each trading down more than 5%.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nHere\u2019s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today. This platform is offering 8.1% APY on idle cash and up to 15 FREE Stocks with qualified deposits for a limited time.\n\nBut, even when the market gets hammered, there are ways to make money. Short-dated options contracts are a risky way to play the market, but when they go right, they can be a vehicle to make large gains very quickly.\n\nOn Tuesday, put contracts on the QQQs with a strike price of $469 that expired Wednesday afternoon closed at $.05 a contract, according to Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD). At the time, the QQQs were trading at more than $480 a share, making it very unlikely that the index would trade below the strike price.\n\nAt their highs on Wednesday, those same contracts that would have cost $5 on Tuesday, were worth more than $510 a pop. This means that 100 contracts of those specific puts could have been purchased for $500 on Tuesday, and sold for more than $50,000 on Wednesday, good for a gain of more than 9,900%.\n\nTrending:\n\nEnjoy freedom to trade from market hours with this revolutionary platform allowing 24-hour trading access. Tauted as being one of the most budget-friendly premium options tradings, it now offers zero contract fees on equity options and a bonus of 5 free stocks\n\nPut contracts give the buyer the right to sell the underlying equity (in this case 100 shares of the QQQs) at the predetermined strike price, regardless of where the stock is trading, up until the expiration date. With Wednesday's wicked red day, well outside the standard deviation move of the overall market, those put contracts exploded in price.\n\nTypically, the $SPY or $QQQs don't move more than 2% in a single day. But, because Tuesday afternoon featured earnings reports from two of the biggest holdings in each index (Tesla and Google) there was an extra catalyst, making the market prime for a larger-than-expected move.\n\nNot to mention the fact that the rapid rise of volatility on Wednesday also increased the value of the contracts. When the VIX (an indicator of market volatility) goes higher, so does the underlying value of options contracts. This is because the increased volatility makes it more likely that a stock could hit the strike price associated with the options contract.\r\n\r\nRead Next:\n\nStory continues\n\nHere\u2019s how much you should have invested in Nvidia in 2022 to become a millionaire today.

        "title": "Biden's speech, Ford's miss, European earnings - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The tech-led selloff looks set to continue Thursday, while Ford has also disappointed with a second-quarter profit miss. Biden points to a new generation after addressing the nation, while the European earnings season presses on.\n\n1. Biden points to a new generation\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation on Wednesday for the first time since dropping his reelection bid, explaining he was stepping aside to allow a new generation to take over after weeks of concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden is the oldest president in U.S. history, at 81, and becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, pulled out of his campaign.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, it\u2019s become clear to me that I need to unite my party,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nThe spotlight now falls on Vice President Kamala Harris, who is set to be formally nominated as the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate as soon as next week, before the party's Aug. 19-22 convention in Chicago.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a lead of two percentage points over Republican candidate Donald Trump, 44% to 42%. A CNN poll by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49% to 46%. Both findings were within the polls' margins of error.\n\n2. Futures steady ahead of growth data\n\nU.S. stock futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the previous session\u2019s sharp tech-driven selloff continuing ahead of the release of key growth data.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, higher, while S&P 500 futures dropped 15 points, or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 120 points, or 0.6%.\n\nThe major Wall Street indices slumped on Wednesday, driven by poorly received earnings from tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 500 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.3% and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 3.6%, the worst session since 2022.\n\nThere will be more earnings to digest Thursday, from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS).\n\nMore than 25% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their second-quarter earnings, according to FactSet data, and although some major tech stocks have disappointed, the overall nature of the earnings session has been generally positive.\n\nInvestors will also study the release of preliminary second-quarter GDP data before the market open, and is expected to show annualized growth of 2.0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis would be above the 1.4% growth seen in the first quarter, but would remain considerably slower than the 4.2% pace seen in the second half of last year.\n\n3. Ford slumps after profit miss\n\nFord (NYSE:F) stock slumped premarket after the auto giant reported a significant profit miss for the second quarter as it continues to battle costly quality issues and an EV business that is weighing on its bottom line.\n\nFord stock fell over 11% after hours following the Detroit automaker posting an adjusted profit of 47 cents per share, significantly missing analysts' expectations of 68 cents, according to LSEG data.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley has made fixing the automaker's quality problems a priority since he took charge in October 2020, but warranty expenses went up $800 million in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nLegacy automakers have tended to scale down their EV ambitions amid easing demand, a shift to hybrids and stiff competition.\n\n\"Overall, the EV journey has been humbling, but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our (traditional gas-engine) business, and that will pay off in the long run,\" said Farley. \"The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains.\"\n\n4. European earnings roll in\n\nA number of important European companies have released their quarterly earnings Thursday for investors to digest.\n\nLuxury giant Kering (EPA:PRTP), best known for its Gucci brand, disappointed with its second-quarter results, as overall sales fell by 11% year-on-year on a constant currency basis, a steeper decline than expected.\n\nAnglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) raised its sales and profit forecast for 2024 and topped analyst expectations for second-quarter revenue, buoyed by demand for its therapies for cancer and rare diseases.\n\nSanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)'s second-quarter profit rose on strong demand for its blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent and better-than-expected sales of new launches.\n\nNestle (SIX:NESN) reported half-year sales growth below expectations and lowered its full-year organic sales growth outlook to at least 3% from about 4% previously, as the world's biggest packaged food company said prices had come down faster than expected.\n\nUnilever (LON:ULVR) reported weaker-than-expected underlying quarterly sales after the British consumer goods giant felt the backlash from higher prices, while French oil major TotalEnergies (EPA:TTEF) reported a 6% fall in second-quarter earnings.\n\n5. Crude falls amid demand concerns\n\nCrude prices retreated Thursday, as concerns about waning demand, especially from China, the world's largest crude importer, continued to weigh.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.5% to $77.19 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $81.30 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks settled higher on Wednesday, snapping consecutive sessions of declines after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.7 million barrels last week, more than expected.\n\nHowever, prices remained close to two-month lows as concerns over waning demand, coupled with forecasts of a potential oil market surplus in 2025 and talk of a ceasefire in the Middle East kept traders largely bearish towards crude.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden's speech, Ford's miss, European earnings - what's moving markets\n\nInvestors turn long on Singapore dollar after 7 months; bearish bets on Asian FX ease - Reuters poll\n\nSouth Korea seeks to cut inheritance tax in first revision since 2000\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian stocks fell sharply on Thursday, tracking an overnight rout on Wall Street as weak earnings from major technology companies drove outsized losses in the sector.\n\nWeak sentiment towards China also remained in play, with the country\u2019s stock benchmarks testing their lowest levels since February.\n\nWall Street indexes tumbled in overnight trade, with the NASDAQ Composite plummeting over 3% as middling earnings from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) sparked an extended rout in tech.\n\nBut U.S. stock index futures rose marginally in Asian trade, suggesting that Wall Street may at least be stabilizing from recent losses. Focus was also on upcoming gross domestic product and PCE price index data due in the coming days.\n\nAsian tech tracks Wall St slide, strong earnings disregarded\n\nTech-heavy Asian bourses were by far the worst performers on Thursday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 losing 2.7%, while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI slid 1.8%. The KOSPI was also dented by weaker-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter.\n\nMemory chip making giant SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) tumbled nearly 9%, even as it clocked stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on robust artificial intelligence demand.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index tumbled 1.8%, as Chinese internet giants tracked losses in their U.S. peers.\n\nAlphabet headlined these losses, even as the firm\u2019s quarterly earnings beat consensus. But signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased costs, especially on AI, drove concerns over other tech earnings reflecting similar trends.\n\nThe tech sector was already nursing steep losses over the past week, as it was slammed by profit-taking after a major melt-up over the past year. Expectations of interest rate cuts, specifically in the U.S., also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nJapan, Australia and India see profit-taking from record highs\n\nBroader Asian markets also slid, as risk appetite was hammered by the tech rout. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index fell 1.2%, while Japan\u2019s broader TOPIX index lost 2.2%. Both indexes had surged to record highs earlier in July.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index fell 0.3%, pointing to a negative open as the index also grappled with a high degree of profit-taking in recent sessions. The Nifty and India\u2019s BSE Sensex 30 had notched a series of record peaks in July, but were now set to pull back substantially from those levels.\n\nChinese stocks test five-month lows\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell relatively less than their Asian peers, owing to lower tech weightage in both indexes. But they were both down around 0.7%, and were also at their weakest levels since late-February.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese markets were nursing steep losses as a swathe of weak economic readings battered sentiment towards the country. The Chinese economy grew less than expected in the second quarter.\n\nSurprise interest rate cuts in the country also did little to improve sentiment. Reports on Thursday showed that several state-owned Chinese banks had lowered borrowing costs following a surprise reduction in the loan prime rate earlier this week.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks tumble as tech rout spills over; China shares test 5-mth lows\n\nJapan's Honda to close China plant, halt production at another factory\n\nLogistics giant Lineage raises $4.44 billion in biggest IPO of 2024\n\nView comments",

The electric car maker offered middling cues on its plans for full self driving and robotaxis, while investors were unimpressed by CEO Elon Musk flagging progress in developing a humanoid robot, \u201cOptimus.\u201d\n\nAlphabet steadied from a 5% tumble, as signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased expenditure on AI largely offset an earnings beat.\n\nAnalysts were also concerned that the internet giant\u2019s earnings could herald a similar trend in its peers, especially amid fears that the increased spending on AI now appeared to be providing slowing returns.\n\nLosses in the two had spilled over into their peers on Wednesday, dragging Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively. AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) slumped 6.8%, although all three stocks rose marginally in after-hours trading.\n\nTech was already nursing steep losses over the past weeks, as the sector saw heavy profit-taking after hype over AI drove a major melt-up in valuation over the past year. Expectations of lower interest rates- on which the Fed is set to provide more cues next week- also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite slumped 3.6% to 17,345.84 points on Wednesday, largely leading losses among its peers. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% to 5,427.13 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% to 39,853.87 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle, IBM advance on strong Q2; Ford slumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) rose 3% after clocking stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. The fast casual Mexican restaurant chain logged strong comparable restaurant sales in the quarter.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) rose 2.4% after increased interest in AI helped the tech consulting firm log stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nBut on the other hand, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) slumped over 12% after clocking disappointing earnings, as automobile sales slowed sharply amid decreased consumer spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures limp higher after tech rout batters Wall Street\n\nBattery firm LG Energy Solution Q2 profit plunges on weak EV demand\n\nBoeing finalizes 737 MAX guilty plea deal, US outlines reasons\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Before Tesla Inc.\u2019s results, investors were looking for signs of stability in the company\u2019s electric-car business and some hint that a dazzling self-driving vehicle was imminent.

But he also confirmed an earlier report that the company was delaying the unveiling of the so-called robotaxi to October.\n\n\u201cInvestors were generally confused and lacked conviction into Tesla\u2019s 2Q print,\u201d Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWe believe the key takeaway from Tesla\u2019s 2Q print, a miss driven by auto margins, is that for now, the focus shifts back to fundamentals.\u201d\n\nTesla shares had risen 85% between their low in April and near-term peak in early July, in part because of the broader speculation that big tech companies will benefit from breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. The rally added more than $380 billion to the company\u2019s valuation, even as analysts\u2019 estimates for its earnings and revenue have been sliding. The second-quarter results announced on Tuesday further highlighted that dissonance.\n\n\u201cThe disconnect from reality means anything can happen,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. \u201cWhile it is understandable Tesla shares traded off following the report, it remains hard to understand why they were at such levels prior to the report.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, while Musk has made self-driving cars a pillar of the company\u2019s future, most analysts agree that the company will need the support of its core auto business to keep generating cash flow until robotaxis are commercially viable.\n\nYet, the results did not do enough to allay concerns about the company\u2019s EV business, which has been struggling amid a broader slowdown in demand. Tesla\u2019s earnings missed estimates for the fourth consecutive quarter and its automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits \u2014 a closely watched metric \u2014 fell to 14.6% in the second quarter from 16.4% in the first three months of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cGiven the hype cycle the past few weeks around AI, we would expect shares to retrace the recent rally as nothing new was offered around progress with AI,\u201d said Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald, CFRA and New Street Research downgraded their recommendations on the stock after the earnings.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the stock in the near term is the lack of any strong catalyst that can push it higher, analysts said. The shares are already trading at an expensive multiple \u2014 nearly 80 times forward earnings \u2014 well above the valuations of other mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing risk that even the October robotaxi event may not live up to the high expectations built into the stock, according to some analysts.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s Robotaxi announcement in October may be more aspirational than substantive,\u201d Sanford C.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. reported another quarter of disappointing profit and postponed a highly anticipated unveiling of autonomous taxis, sending the carmaker\u2019s volatile stock plunging the most in almost six months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now. Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her Tesla Slumps as Musk Tethers Its Future to Delayed Robotaxis Singapore Has World\u2019s Most Powerful Passport After Unseating Europeans\n\nAdjusted earnings fell to 52 cents per share in the three months ended in June, missing estimates for the fourth consecutive quarter. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk confirmed the company will push back an event showcasing robotaxi prototypes by about two months, to October, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report.\n\nTesla\u2019s shares tumbled 11% after the markets opened Wednesday in New York, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 25. The stock had surged since the company last reported earnings, recovering from a more than 40% decline for the year.\n\nSentiment had improved for Tesla following a tumultuous start to the year. The company missed expectations for vehicle sales by the biggest margin ever in the first quarter, spurring mass firings. Musk responded by talking up the work Tesla has been doing for years on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, and the shares roared back.\n\n\u201cThe value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy,\u201d Musk said Tuesday, again urging anyone who disagrees to sell the stock.\n\nTesla will now unveil robotaxis on Oct. 10, and the cars shown will only be prototypes. More affordable models that could juice sales won\u2019t go into production until the first half of next year, at the earliest. A planned factory in Mexico is on pause until after the US presidential election in November, and a humanoid robot that Musk predicts will send Tesla\u2019s valuation soaring won\u2019t start selling until sometime in 2026.\n\nThat combination of timelines leaves investors in something of a holding pattern as Tesla\u2019s car output and sales decline. The world\u2019s largest seller of battery-electric vehicles is well off its pace of 1.8 million deliveries last year and reiterated that volume growth will be \u201cnotably lower\u201d in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe whole story here is about what else is to come,\u201d said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\n\nWhile profit slumped for a third quarter in a row, revenue beat expectations, rising to a record $25.5 billion. The surprise gain was driven by growth in the company\u2019s energy generation and storage business, as well as $890 million in sales of regulatory credits to carmakers needing Tesla\u2019s help to meet emissions requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits \u2014 a closely watched metric \u2014 fell to 14.6% in the second quarter, from 16.4% in the first three months of the year. That drop reflects falling vehicle sales and pricing, rising expenditures on AI and other projects, and restructuring charges from sweeping job cuts. Tesla recognized $583 million in employee termination expenses that were \u201csubstantially paid during the quarter,\u201d according to a regulatory filing.\n\nMusk said Tesla will manufacture new, lower-cost cars at its plant in Austin starting in the first half of next year. The company will also make both the robotaxi \u2014 which Munster expects to be ready no sooner than 2026 or 2027 \u2014 and the Optimus robot in Texas.\n\nTesla has been slow-walking previously announced plans to build a factory in Mexico and will put off a decision on that plant until after the US election. Republican nominee Donald Trump, who Musk has endorsed, has repeatedly threatened to hit products made in Mexico with tariffs.\n\n\u201cTrump has said that he\u2019ll put in heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case,\u201d Musk said.\n\nMusk formally endorsed Trump after the former president was shot during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, and is involved with America PAC, a political action committee backing Trump. During Tesla\u2019s earnings call, Musk downplayed the risk Trump may pose to Tesla\u2019s business.\n\nThe CEO said that if Trump returns to the White House and does away with subsidies tucked in the Inflation Reduction Act, it would be devastating for competitors and impact Tesla \u201cslightly.\u201d In the long term, though, he said it may actually help Tesla.\n\n\u201cWe knew Tesla\u2019s base car business was struggling and expect Street numbers to trend lower post the results,\u201d Jeff Osborne, a TD Cowen analyst with a hold rating on the stock, wrote in a report to clients. \u201cGiven the hype cycle the past few weeks around AI, we would expect shares to retrace the recent rally as nothing new was offered around progress with AI.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Chester Dawson.\n\n(Updates with stock trading in the first and third paragraphs)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "title": "Why Tesla Stock Just Crashed",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock fell 11% through 11:45 a.m. ET Wednesday after the company badly missed analyst forecasts for earnings Tuesday night.\n\nHeading into the second-quarter report, Wall Street forecast the electric car leader would earn $0.62 per share on sales of $24.8 billion. Tesla exceeded the latter expectation, reporting Q2 sales of $25.5 billion. But this sales growth came at a cost to profit: Earnings were only $0.52 per share.\n\nTesla profits collapse\n\nNot all Tesla's news was bad. Notably, the company's energy generation (i.e., solar panels) and storage (i.e., batteries) division -- which believe it or not is now more profitable (with an 18.9% gross profit margin) than the automotive business, doubled in size to $1.5 billion in sales. And free cash flow for the quarter increased nicely to $1.3 billion.\n\nAutomotive sales, however, fell 7% year over year. And total sales were up an anemic 2%, despite beating estimates.\n\nParticularly worrisome is the fact that operating expenses surged 39% in the quarter. Falling sales and rising costs is not usually a recipe for strong profits, and this proved true for Tesla, too. The company's operating profit margin shrank by more than a third, to 6.3%. Operating profits fell one-third to $1.6 billion. Net profits cratered -- down 45%.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nEven then, the bad news wasn't done. Turns out, both analyst forecasts and Tesla's $0.52 headline result were put in the form of pro forma, non-GAAP profits. When calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles, Tesla's profit per share was only $0.42.\n\nSo what does this mean for investors?\n\nAt $700 billion in market capitalization and with $12.4 billion in trailing earnings, Tesla stock currently costs more than 56 times trailing earnings. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if Tesla was still growing its sales by 50% or 70% annually, as happened during the pandemic.

        "title": "The Worst of the Worst: 7 Meme Stocks to Avoid at all Costs",
        "content": "There\u2019s a rotation going on the stock market.\n\nThe magnificent seven tech stocks and various AI names have started to dip in recent weeks. Meanwhile, long-forgotten smaller-capitalization and value stocks have begun to rally.\n\nThis shift in the market forces has reinvigorated a great number of meme stocks, with many names posting sharp rallies in July. But traders shouldn\u2019t get carried away with this move. These seven meme stocks to avoid remain on incredibly uneven footing and are likely to slump again later this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nWhen thinking of meme stocks to avoid, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) springs to mind.\n\nThe movie theater chain has been a leading arena for traders since 2021. AMC\u2019s bulls continue to hope for a tremendous short squeeze to lift shares to the heavens.\n\nUnfortunately, the company\u2019s poor fundamentals have squashed those hopes. Specifically, AMC\u2019s revenues only rebounded to $4.8 billion in 2023, leaving them well short of the $5.5 billion that the company brought in back in 2019. Factoring in the high level of inflation in the ensuing period, that\u2019s an especially poor result.\n\nAMC remains unprofitable and analysts see the company losing money in 2024 and 2025. And from 2023\u2019s relatively low revenue level, analysts see sales slipping this year amid a weak movie slate and lackluster consumer spending.\n\nWorst of all, shareholders have had to endure incredible dilution to fund AMC\u2019s operating losses. AMC\u2019s share count (adjusted for reverse splits) has risen from just 24 million shares in 2019 to 189 million shares now. It\u2019s hard for meme stock buying to offset that level of new share issuance in a company.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) can\u2019t hold a charge. The struggling hydrogen power firm has been in business since the 1990s. Despite having many chances to prove itself, the hydrogen fuel cell company seems farther from profitability than ever.\n\nPLUG stock has plunged more than 99% from its all-time highs. Despite a steady stream of press releases and new developments, little of it ever seems to amount to profitable business expansion. In fact, Plug Power lost money each of the past 10 years. Recently, the results have worsened. Plug Power lost more than $1 billion in 2023, and losses are\u00a0continuing to mount in 2024.\n\nTraders keep coming back to PLUG stock, seemingly in hopes of a short squeeze. The issue is, however, that Plug Power needs to unleash an unending stream of dilution on the market to keep funding its operating losses.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo that point, Plug Power\u2019s outstanding share count has soared from 159 million in 2014 to 595 million as of the most recent report. And it\u2019s about to go up yet again; PLUG stock sunk recently on news of another stock offering to raise money.\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) is a small technology company which is attempting to commercialize delivery robots.\n\nThe company is most known for its partnership with Uber\u2019s (NYSE:UBER) food delivery operation. The framework is in place for Serve to produce as many as 2,000 delivery bots for Uber to serve the Los Angeles market.\n\nHowever, SERV stock was not cooking up much excitement this year, with the stock lingering in the $2 range recently.\n\nAll that changed this week. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed that it purchased 62,500 SERV shares for $4 each, adding to a prior stake that it had obtained via a promissory note.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting that Nvidia involved, of course. But this transaction is chump change for a company of Nvidia\u2019s size, and the semiconductor company is known for taking equity positions in a variety of small start-ups. Investors should be exceedingly cautious with SERV stock given that shares have already quadrupled from recent levels and are now trading at a massive valuation.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior. The company develops voice-recognition, natural language understanding, sound-recognition and search technologies.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve been a long-time skeptic on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\nThe technology firm develops independent voice-driven artificial intelligence solutions. It has some exciting plans, and SoundHound signed up a credible client list.\n\nHowever, the issue is that SOUN stock doesn\u2019t appear to be particularly tied to its fundamentals. Rather the valuation has run far ahead of the underlying business. Like with Serve Robotics, it seems that traders are buying SoundHound primarily because Nvidia is an investor.\n\nSoundHound AI may eventually become a compelling business. But the firm generated just $11 million in revenues last quarter and is running large losses. That\u2019s nowhere near what\u2019s necessary to support the company\u2019s current $1.6 billion market cap.\n\nQuantumScape (QS) QuantumScape (QS) is an American company that develops solid state lithium metal batteries for electric cars.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantumScape (NASDAQ:QS) is a company that is attempting to commercialize a new solid-state battery model.\n\nYears ago, QS stock was one of the biggest winners of the SPAC boom, with shares rising tenfold at one point. However, a new battery technology takes a long time, from prototype to recurring revenues. Meanwhile, short sellers raised pointed questions about the company\u2019s underlying technology.\n\nThe latest issue for QuantumScape comes from politics. Former President Donald Trump has taken the lead in the polls, and his pick for vice president, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, has\u00a0proposed policies that could have massively negative ramifications for the battery and electric vehicle industries.\n\nQuantumScape popped higher recently on news of a further partnership with Volkswagen. But with analysts seeing minimal revenues through at least 2025 and QuantumScape being unprofitable for years, QS stock is a sell on all rallies.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantumScape isn\u2019t the only meme stock facing issues with a potential Trump presidency.\n\nIn fact, with Trump reportedly making an anti-electric vehicle stance a cornerstone of his campaign, the whole EV sector could come under fire.\n\nBigger players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may already have enough of a balance sheet, brand, and recurring cash flow base to endure an anti-EV administration. For a small struggling outfit like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), however, this could be a crippling blow.\n\nIn Q1, Lucid generated a modest $173 million in revenues, which rose only slightly from the $149 million it brought in during the same period of 2023. That growth rate simply isn\u2019t going to cut it, given that Lucid lost an eye-watering $730 million from operations last quarter alone.\n\nLCID stock popped 40% in recent weeks. It\u2019s time to dump this meme stock before a potential Trump presidency further weakens this EV firm\u2019s already tenuous competitive positioning.\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) Jumia (JMIA) logo on a cellphone with a flower\n\nSource: farzand01 / Shutterstock.com\n\nJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) has long been pitched as the so-called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa.\n\nIn theory, that could be a highly appealing business. In practice, Jumia has struggled to turn that promise into reality. That are significant structural challenges in building an African e-commerce giant, such as lack of delivery infrastructure, limited free trade regions, and major language and cultural differences between countries.\n\nLong story short, Jumia\u2019s revenues were essentially dead flat between 2019 and 2023, almost entirely missing out on the recent e-commerce boom. Jumia continues to lose significant sums of money.\n\nJMIA stock has popped sharply following positive analyst coverage. That\u2019s not a bad thing, of course. But with Jumia shares up 300% year-to-date despite its middling fundamentals, this is a meme stock to sell now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "PLTR Outlook: Does a Potential Trump Boost Make Palantir Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "With the odds of former President Donald Trump winning November\u2019s election rather high, I\u2019m much more upbeat on the outlook of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Palantir stock than I have been in recent years. However, given the huge valuation of the shares and the Street\u2019s mixed views on the name, I remain cautious nonetheless.\n\nTrump\u2019s Reelection Would Probably Lift Palantir\u2019s Financial Results\n\nPalantir co-founder Peter Thiel looks likely to offer substantial financial support for Trump\u2019s campaign sooner or later. A former supporter, Thiel has seen JD Vance, known as his \u201cprotege,\u201d selected as Trump\u2019s running mate. Moreover, Thiel is viewed as friendly with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who recently backed Trump and is reportedly donating $45 million per month to his campaign.\n\nThiel, however, has expressed a great deal of disappointment with Trump\u2019s tenure as President. Still, given Vance\u2019s status as Trump\u2019s running mate and Musk\u2019s huge backing of the Republican, along with the fact that Thiel could greatly improve Palantir\u2019s outlook by donating funds to Trump, I believe the multibillionaire will donate significant funds to Trump sooner or later.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd according to most polls, Trump is running ahead of the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s campaign does receive funds from Thiel, I expect the Trump-Vance administration to greatly increase the size and number of contracts awarded by the federal government to Palantir.\n\nIn Palantir\u2019s fiscal 2023, the firm obtained $1.2 billion of revenue from governments, versus its total sales of $2.2 billion. Therefore, by significantly increasing Palantir\u2019s revenue from Washington, a Trump-Vance administration could tremendously boost the company\u2019s financial results.\n\nA Huge Valuation and a Sharply Divided Street\n\nOn the valuation front, Palantir stock is changing hands at a huge forward price-to-earnings ratio of 87 times. Its price-to-sales ratio, which stands at 28.7 times, is no more appealing. In light of its exorbitant levels, I believe that most if not all of any boost it will get from a Trump-Vance administration is already baked into the shares.\n\nMeanwhile, Palantir stock remains very controversial on the Street. In the 90 days that ended on July 22, a total of eight analysts issued \u201csell\u201d or strong sell\u201d ratings on the name. Four others gave the shares a \u201chold\u201d rating.\u201d Moreover, only six analysts placed a \u201cbuy\u201d or a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating on the shares.\n\nOn July 16, Japanese bank Mizuho downgraded its rating on Palantir stock to \u201cunderperform\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d The bank believes that the shares\u2019 valuation is \u201chard to justify,\u201d while the outlook of the company\u2019s business is uncertain. Additionally, the bank believes the company has delivered \u201clower quality\u201d earnings, Investing.com reported. Mizuho could be referring to the fact the company\u2019s profits remain relatively low. For example, the firm\u2019s first-quarter operating income came in at $81 million. That\u2019s not a very high OI, considering we\u2019re talking about a stock with a market capitalization of $63.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso noteworthy is that analysts expect Palantir\u2019s earnings per share to climb to 33 cents this year and 40 cents in 2025 versus 25 cents in 2023. While the percentage increases are relatively high, a company with huge valuations only increasing EPS by just 7 cents or 8 cents annually is a bit unusual and disconcerting.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA Trump-Vance administration would likely wind up significantly boosting Palantir\u2019s financial results. But given the huge valuation of Palantir stock, the skepticism about it from much of the Street, and the company\u2019s relatively low profits, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the shares drop sharply before the firm benefits from a Trump boost. And even if a change in the White House does provide Palantir with a positive catalyst, I believe the shares could already reflect that situation.\n\nConsequently, I recommend that investors sell their shares of Palantir stock. If Trump wins the election with backing from Thiel, Palantir stock drops at least 15% and the company\u2019s bottom line rises meaningfully more than expected, I would likely become more bullish on the shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s faster-than-expected adoption of autonomous driving is doing little to rev up optimism among analysts searching for Baidu Inc.\u2019s next catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup A Six-Second Decision Shows How Harris Snapped Up Delegates Trump Floated Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary, Then Denies It Harris Has Enough Delegates to Clinch Nomination for President Wiz Rejects Google\u2019s $23 Billion Offer, Seeks IPO Instead\n\nThe internet search leader\u2019s shares have almost erased gains notched in Hong Kong this month after the company announced an expansion into ride hailing with a fleet of fully self-driving cars in the city of Wuhan. Now, Baidu\u2019s stock may extend its year-to-date decline with analysts cutting its average 12-month target price to an all-time low.\n\n\u201cThe stock price has not priced in robotaxi potential. But to be honest, it shouldn\u2019t right now either, because no one really knows how successful it will be, nor do they know about future government policy toward the technology,\u201d said Kai Wang, a Morningstar analyst. \u201cMass commercialization is still like three to five years away.\u201d\n\nOf concern is whether Baidu\u2019s new growth plans will be able to offset its weak advertising revenues fast enough, particularly given a lack of certainty around pending regulations or consumer demand for such products. Market competition and a weak macro environment may also weigh on the stock.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Autonomous driving and machine learning have been core tenets in Baidu\u2019s broader ambitions to expand within the artificial intelligence sector. Its autonomous ride-hailing arm \u201cApollo Go\u201d launched a cheap robotaxi model in May and aims to be profitable by next year. Baidu is also expanding this service beyond Wuhan to more Chinese cities. The company in April signed an agreement with Tesla Inc. to embed its maps into the automaker\u2019s self-driving systems.\n\nYet that hasn\u2019t been enough to sway market watchers. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea wrote in a note last month that Baidu was likely to lose market share in AI due to a price war, and its earnings might \u201cundergo a double-digit sequential decline this year with its AI ventures continuing to lose money.\u201d\n\nOn robotaxis in particular, a case study of operations in Shanghai unveiled \u201cdiscouragingly deep loss-making financials,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Alex Yao wrote in a report this month. Discounts offered by Baidu make the strategy commercially unviable, they added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose concerns have forced at least seven brokers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, to slash their price targets over the past two weeks.\n\nThere may be other headaches too. Baidu\u2019s operations in Wuhan are under increasing scrutiny, with local media citing concerns including the rising unemployment of taxi drivers and the safety of those cars in more complicated traffic situations.\n\nStill, given China\u2019s driverless ride-hailing market potential, Baidu\u2019s growth plans may still be a win in the long term. The country currently has about four to five million ride-railing cars in operation, according to Goldman Sachs. If 5% of those cars can switch into self driving vehicles and offer similar pricing to normal taxis, that translates into a $5 billion market, it says.\n\nAt least six cities or provinces recently announced trials to promote autonomous driving over the past month, which may help grow demand.\n\nTesla\u2019s Profit Falls Short Again in a Weakened EV Market\n\nFor now, the next catalyst will likely come during the firm\u2019s earnings next month. Baidu is expected to report 1.2% growth in revenue for the second quarter, similar to the pace in the March period which was the slowest since 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And after a short spike in demand for bullish option contracts when the company announced its expansion in Wuhan, trading volume has quickly come down.\n\n\u201cRobotaxis are unlikely to generate any significant revenue or earnings for Baidu over the next few years,\u201d BI\u2019s Lea said, adding that its earnings might show a double-digit sequential decline this year. \u201cThe technology is high risk and remains at an immature stage, with developmental hurdles yet to overcome.\u201d\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nIn recent months, Google showed interest in two companies, either of which would have been the biggest-ever purchase for the internet giant. And both times, the deals fell apart. On Monday, the chief executive of Wiz Inc. told staff that the cybersecurity startup would reject a $23 billion offer from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and instead pursue an initial public offering. That came just weeks after Google shelved plans to buy HubSpot Inc., a $25 billion software firm. Texas Instruments Inc. provided a sales outlook that signals an inventory glut is coming to an end, reassuring investors that a revival is underway in key markets for the company\u2019s chips. Hackers have leaked internal documents stolen from Leidos Holdings Inc., one of the largest IT services providers to the US government, according to a person familiar with the matter. India\u2019s video market is expected to reach $13 billion in revenue by 2028, boosted by the streaming industry, which has continued to invest billions of dollars in content development every year, according to a new report. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new and powerful AI model that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg called \u201cstate of the art\u201d and said will rival similar offerings from competitors like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's potential removal of support for electric vehicles would hurt other automakers more than the Austin, Texas-based firm.\n\n\"It would be devastating for our competitors, and it would hurt Tesla slightly but long term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess,\" Musk said in a post-earnings conference call after the EV maker reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years.\n\nFormer President Trump, the Republican candidate supported by Musk, has been critical of the Biden administration's EV policies and has said that he will \"end the electric vehicle mandate\" if he wins office.\n\nTrump has not explained the plan in detail.\n\nMusk said any Trump removal of subsidies, and the resulting impact on Tesla car sales was not crucial because Tesla is an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving technology.\n\n\"The value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire announced his endorsement of Trump shortly after an assassination attempt on the presidential candidate this month.\n\nMusk has denied a media report that he pledged to donate $45 million per month to Trump, but he said he had created a political action committee.\n\nMusk's support for Trump created some confusion among Tesla fans who questioned how his election would help the EV company.\n\nTrump's pick for vice president, JD Vance, last year introduced a bill to eliminate EV subsidies and replace them with a credit to promote gas-powered vehicles, though it has virtually no chance of passing in the current Congress.\n\nMusk said in a post on X last week, \"Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla. Also, remove subsidies from all industries!\"\n\nIn his acceptance speech at the Republican Party's convention last week in Milwaukee, Trump said his administration would slap tariffs of 100% to 200% on cars made in Mexico to make them \"unsellable\" in the United States.\n\nMusk said on Tuesday the EV maker has paused plans for a plant in Mexico and would reassess investing in a new gigafactory in the country after the U.S. presidential election.\n\n\"Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico so it doesn't make sense to invest in Mexico,\" he said.\n\nMusk said Tesla is increasing capacity at its existing factories significantly and plans to produce robotaxis at its factory in Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "Elon Musk says a Trump presidency \u2018would be devastating\u2019 to Tesla\u2019s competitors",
        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is firmly in former President Donald Trump\u2019s corner politically, but what a potential Trump Administration could mean for the electric vehicle maker that pays Musk billions is unclear\u2014even to Musk himself.\n\nDuring a call with financial analysts on Tuesday, Wells Fargo director Colin Langan asked Musk to explain the impact of a Trump win and the potential wipeout of a federal $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cI guess there would be some impact,\u201d said Musk. \u201cIt would be devastating for our competitors, and it would hurt Tesla slightly.\u201d\n\nThe CEO also noted that because Trump has promised heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico, Tesla would pull back on investing in a factory it had planned to open in Monterrey in 2026. \u201cIf that\u2019s going to be the case, we kind of need to see how things play out politically,\u201d he said. Yesterday, Musk denied reports that he would pump $45 million per month into Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC before the earnings call, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said that a Trump presidency could be negative for the overall EV market because Trump could eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act and with it the tax credits for EVs and certain plug-in hybrids. That would mean an administration under Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic party nominee, could be a positive for the EV industry.\n\nYet, Trump might be better for the regulatory agenda needed to promote full-self driving and autonomy, which is a key component of Tesla\u2019s growth strategy, said Ives.\n\n\u201cMusk has been background noise under the Biden Administration and in a Trump administration, is that something that will be more front and center?\u201d said Ives. \u201cThat\u2019s why I would say Tesla is part of that Trump trade.\u201d\n\nMusk dismissed the notion that regulators might balk at a fleet of Tesla-made, self-driving robotaxis without steering wheels and pedals. An analyst asked Musk to explain why regulatory risk wasn\u2019t an issue for Tesla, when General Motors had paused production of its Origin vehicle that doesn\u2019t have a steering wheel, in favor of its Chevrolet Bolt, in part because of regulation. The Cruise Origin autonomous vehicle would need approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration because it doesn't have traditional manual controls like a steering wheel and pedals, which are required by current safety regulations, and were written for cars with human drivers and not fully autonomous vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe main reason with switching from the Origin to the Bolt is we extinguish the regulatory risk,\u201d GM CEO Mary Barra said, according to a Reuters report.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe real reason they canceled it is because GM can\u2019t make it work,\u201d said Musk, adding that the automaker\u2019s technology \u201cis not up to par.\u201d He said blaming regulators was \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\nJim Cain, an executive director at GM, told Fortune Musk is flat wrong.\n\n\u201cAll of those statements are categorically false,\u201d said Cain, who listened to Musk\u2019s comments during the earnings call. \u201cThe Origin vehicle faced a lot of hurdles getting certified because it doesn\u2019t have a steering wheel, it doesn\u2019t have a brake pedal, and it has a unique seating layout that requires a federal motor vehicle safety waiver\u2014full stop.\u201d\n\nCain said Cruise technology improves every day because of the way it leverages its data set with AI. \u201cAnd so far, they have driven more than 5 million fully autonomous miles and Tesla has driven exactly zero.\u201d\n\nMusk has an unshakeable faith in Tesla\u2019s power to \u201csolve autonomy,\u201d which he reiterated Tuesday, even as Tesla reported financial results showing net profits dropped 45%, marking its second quarter of sluggish growth and fourth straight quarter of falling quarterly earnings. Car industry data also showed that Tesla continues to lose popularity in California, where sales fell 24% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Trump has pledged to end what he referred to as the \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d promising to abolish \u201cthe electric-vehicle mandate on day one.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ives, if autonomy is the strategic future of Tesla, it might be more beneficial for Tesla to have less regulation, which is likelier under a Trump presidency versus a Harris presidency.\n\n\u201cThe cherry on top of what could be the sundae\u201d for investors is how the company will impact the robotics market and its efforts on full-self driving and autonomy, said Ives. Ultimately, that\u2019s how the company could potentially reach a $1 trillion or even $2 trillion valuation, he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, weighed by renewed losses in the technology sector as key overnight earnings in the U.S. underwhelmed, while sentiment towards China also showed few signs of improving.\n\nRegional stocks took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, especially a fall in U.S. stock index futures following underwhelming earnings from heavyweights Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThis sparked extended selling in technology stocks, which came as the sector nursed steep losses through the past week. Profit-taking and a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors battered global tech valuations over the past year.\n\nAsian tech lags after soft US earnings\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.5%, while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI shed 0.1%, as losses in tech stocks weighed.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was among the worst performers for the day, losing 0.6% as major electric vehicle stocks fell in tandem with Tesla.\n\nBYD (SZ:002594) Co Ltd (HK:1211), Li Auto Inc (HK:2015) and Xpeng Inc (HK:9868) slid between 2% and 4.3%, tracking a nearly 8% slide in Tesla after the firm\u2019s second-quarter profit missed expectations.\n\nTesla was seen grappling with softening sales and mounting expenses as it diverted more resources towards artificial intelligence and self-driving technology.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s earnings also provided weak cues to Asian markets. While the internet giant did beat expectations with its earnings, slower growth in ad revenue and increased expenditure on AI heralded a similar trend for regional tech giants, who are due to report in the coming weeks. Alphabet\u2019s shares fell 2% in aftermarket trade.\n\nChinese stocks hit 2-week low on economic, political jitters\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively, hitting an over two-week low.\n\nChinese markets saw an extended rout in recent sessions as sentiment towards the country soured in the wake of disappointing economic readings, especially data that showed slower-than-expected growth in the second quarter.\n\nThis was coupled with an underwhelming interest rate cut by the People\u2019s Bank, while the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party also yielded few cues on more stimulus measures.\n\nUncertainty over the U.S. presidential race also weighed on sentiment towards China, as investors speculated over just what a change in U.S. administration will entail for Washington\u2019s stance towards the country.\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 fell slightly as purchasing managers index data showed manufacturing and services activity in the country likely slowed in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan\u2019s TOPIX index fell 0.4%, with losses limited by some signs of improvement in the Japanese economy. While PMI data showed a contraction in manufacturing activity, the services sector rebounded sharply into expansion in July, buoying overall business activity.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index fell 0.1%, with the index facing some weakness as investors balked at the increased capital gains taxes outlined in the government\u2019s 2024 budget.\n\nBut overall, the budget appeared to be more geared towards reducing India\u2019s fiscal deficit and reigning in government spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks drop as tech tracks weak US earnings; China remains on backfoot\n\nElon Musk asks if Tesla should invest $5 bln in xAI\n\nMusk launches poll asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Tuesday, July 23rd, 2024\r\n\r\nMarkets Tuesday behaved reminiscent to a week ago or so. While three of the four major indices hung pretty close to zero-balance and dipped into the red shortly before the closing bell, the small-cap Russell 2000 swooped past the field shortly after the open and remained above it all session. The Dow lost -57 points, -0.14%, while the Nasdaq was -10 points, -0.06%, and the S&P 500 -0.16%. The Russell gained +1.23% and is +10% over the past month of trading.\r\n\r\nAs Q2 earnings begins to elbow out other new events, we take one exception here. This morning, Existing Home Sales for June made the case for the housing industry, but didn\u2019t particularly make it well. A total of 3.89 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units for the month was below the estimated 3.95 million and the unrevised 4.11 million for May. This is the fourth-straight month of lower existing home sales and the lowest of the year as the median price rose to a record-high $426,900. Tomorrow we\u2019ll see New Home Sales, which are expected to be up month over month, taking up a higher percentage of housing demand.\r\n\r\nTesla TSLA disappointed on Q2 earnings this afternoon. Coming out at 52 cents per share was a dime lower than the consensus estimate, while revenues slightly outperformed expectations: $25.50 billion from $25.13 billion. In the press release, the company warned full-year deliveries may be \u201cnotably lower,\u201d with more color expected on the conference call an hour from now. A lower-priced Tesla model and the Robotaxi status are two elements Tesla shareholders will also expect to hear more about. At this hour, TSLA shares are -2.5%.\r\n\r\nGoogle parent Alphabet GOOGL, on the other hand, beat on both top and bottom lines after the close. Earnings of $1.89 per share notched a four-cent beat (and notably ahead of the $1.44 per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on revenues \u2014 minus TAC costs, which the company doesn\u2019t discount on headline \u2014 of $71.36 billion, ahead of the $70.60 billion in the Zacks consensus. YouTube brought in $8.66 billion, which was light of estimates, but its cloud business came in at $10.35 billion, surpassing expectations \u2014 and improving its status among the very biggest cloud-computing companies. Shares were sluggish to start after-hours trading, but are up +1.5% at this hour.\r\n\r\nSeagate Technologies STX had perhaps the most impressive quarter post-closing bell. Its fiscal Q4 earnings came in at $1.05 per share \u2014 20 cents higher than the Zacks consensus and a whopping +680% over the -$0.18 per share posted a year ago for the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated cloud and AI tech firm. Revenues of $1.89 billion outpaced the $1.86 billion expected, and marks the third-straight earnings beat for the company, which is up +6.4% in late trading, adding to the +27% gains year to date.\r\n\r\nTexas Instruments TXN also outperformed in the quarter, but not as substantially. Earnings of $1.22 per share amounted to a six-cent beat \u2014 consistent with its near-perfect record of (slight) improvements over estimates in the past five years. Revenues came in at $3.82 billion, modestly beyond the $3.80 billion analysts had been looking for. The analog-chip giant kept its next-quarter guidance in-line with recent estimates, and shares are up +5% on the news.\r\n\r\nVisa V posted a one-penny beat in its fiscal Q3 this afternoon. Earnings of $2.42 per share was notably ahead of the $2.16 per share reported a year ago. But revenues were a smidge below expectations to $8.9 billion for the quarter, on Payments Volume which grew +7% in the quarter. Shares are down -2% in the late session, virtually giving up the credit card giant\u2019s entire year-to-date gains.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "A very simple rule to make money in the market is to buy when there is fear. Of course, there also needs to be long term fundamental factors that support the logic of buying depressed stocks. With the market trading near all-time highs, it\u2019s relatively difficult to find value stocks. The best idea is to look at depressed sectors that have the potential to bounce back in the coming years. The electric vehicle (EV) sector is one such area, and that\u2019s why now is the best time to buy undervalued EV stocks.\n\nWithout a doubt, the recent depression in EV stocks has been backed by negative developments. These include slower than expected EV adoption, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds and intense competition. However, there are high-quality EV companies that are likely to survive and continue growing beyond the decade.\n\nThis is a solid list of three undervalued EV stocks to buy before they surge higher. Besides the valuation factor, these EV companies have good fundamentals that will support navigation through challenging times.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has already surged from lows with a rally of 36% in the last month. However, the EV stock remains down 7% in the last 12 months. I expect a strong comeback for Tesla once industry sentiments improve.\n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, rate cuts are likely to support growth and lower the cost of borrowing. This is likely to help Tesla in accelerating deliveries growth. However, the key reason to be bullish on Tesla is the innovation edge.\n\nA major catalyst for Tesla in the coming months is the unveiling of its robotaxis. The event is likely in October and Wedbush estimates that robotaxis and artificial intelligence (AI) technology \u201ccould put the company on the path to a $1 trillion valuation.\u201d Further, Oppenheimer believes that a full self-driving technology can \u201cpotentially raise earnings per share by $1-$2 a year through the end of the decade.\u201d\n\nTesla is also looking at a \u201cnew unboxed manufacturing process\u201d that can slash production costs in half. The possibility of a low-cost car is exciting as it will help Tesla gain market share in emerging economies.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock has witnessed a sharp correction dropping 43% year-to-date (YTD). I see this as a good buying opportunity with LI stock trading at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 13.3.\n\nThere are two reasons for the deep correction in LI stock. First, the company lowered its growth expectations for the year. Further, the European Union has imposed tariffs on Chinese EV companies. The latter does not impact Li Auto currently with the EV maker focused exclusively on China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of positives, Li Auto ended Q1 2024 with a robust cash buffer of $13.7 billion. This provides the company with high flexibility for aggressive retail expansion in China. At the same time, Li can continue to invest in product development and technology. It\u2019s worth noting that Li is targeting to launch its Level 3 self-driving technology next year.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that Li Auto will pursue international expansion in 2025. With the tariffs in Europe, the first international market for Li is likely to be in the Middle East. This is a potential growth catalyst in addition to expansion in the luxury EV market within China.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFF) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFF) stock is a massively undervalued name to consider. The EV battery stock trades at a forward P/E of 6.12 and offers a dividend yield of 2.8%. I would not be surprised if PCRFF stock doubles from current levels within the next 24 months. That potential earns it a firm spot on the list of undervalued EV stocks.\n\nWhile sentiments are depressed in the near term, Panasonic has ambitious expansion plans. The company expects to quadruple its EV battery capacity to 200 GWh by 2031. At the same time, Panasonic has guided for EBITDA margin expansion during this period. I, therefore, expect steady growth coupled with cash flow upside.\n\nPanasonic is also looking at manufacturing of solid-state batteries in the long term. However, the initial focus is likely to be on solid-state batteries for drones and factory robots. This is likely to be a big addressable market.\n\nIn terms of product improvement, the battery maker is targeting to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density by 2031. To achieve this, Panasonic will be using nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Put on the Chopping Block if Trump Wins the Election",
        "content": "As of July, political analysts are forecasting a red wave in November and Donald Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office. If you remember, from his first stint as President, Trump implemented several different economic policies. Much of his focus is on returning employment and manufacturing to the United States.\n\nSo, as investors, which companies can we target if Trump wins in November? That will depend on which policies Trump and his administration can implement. From the platform he is campaigning on, we know that Trump wants to reduce President Biden\u2019s focus on clean energy and electric vehicles. Let\u2019s look at three stocks to avoid if Trump wins the election in November.\n\nRivian (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has often been seen as one of the true challengers to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). One positive for Rivian is that it manufactures its vehicles in America at its factory in Georgia. However, Trump has repeatedly stated that he is pulling EV tax credits and incentives, which will be a major blow to an unprofitable startup like Rivian.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrump has been notably anti-EV, recently calling it a green scam. Any reduction in EV funding and consumer subsidies would be detrimental to U.S.-based companies like Rivian. Tesla would suffer, too, but Musk\u2019s announcement that he will be donating $45 million per month to Trump\u2019s campaign seemingly has the EV maker in Trump\u2019s good books.\n\nRivian is far from profitable even after major investments from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Volkswagen. Shares of RIVN have gained nearly 60% over the past month but are still down by 18% in 2024. The stock is trading at 3.2x sales and has an Enterprise Value/Revenue (EV/Revenue) of 2.8, which is a fraction of the valuation of Tesla. Still, with Trump\u2019s negative sentiment surrounding EVs, I\u2019d steer clear of Rivian until there is more regulatory clarity.\n\nEnphase (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is an American solar equipment and infrastructure company. It has been a popular stock among clean energy investors and has provided stellar returns in recent years. Although it was down by about 20% in 2024, it has returned more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nThe solar industry faces problems similar to those of EV-makers like Rivian. Trump and Biden have polarizing opinions on clean energy. If Trump is victorious, he will likely reduce government funding for clean energy infrastructure. In the past, he has also imposed tariffs on some of the components and parts of solar equipment made outside the United States.\n\nStory continues\n\nRepealing Biden\u2019s clean energy bills will be an uphill battle for Trump. He will need the support of both the Senate and the House before anything is significantly changed. Trump has threatened to cancel the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to eliminate the Solar Tax Credit (ITC) for businesses and consumers. Trump\u2019s support of the fossil fuel industry, particularly coal and oil, leaves little room for companies like Enphase to flourish under his watch.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of the most successful companies in history and the seventh largest in the world by market cap. However, Trump\u2019s disdain for Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been well documented and could again rear its ugly head if he wins the Presidency again.\n\nOne of the bullish arguments for Meta is that TikTok\u2019s days as a competitor are numbered in the United States. Trump himself has tried to ban TikTok on multiple occasions. It\u2019s also no secret that Trump is vehemently against China\u2019s government and its documentation of American user data. Recently, Trump has changed his tune on TikTok. He said he favors TikTok staying in America because otherwise, it is just Facebook and Instagram.\n\nPerhaps as a peace offering, Zuckerberg and Meta have reinstated Trump on their platforms. It hasn\u2019t done much to convince Trump or Biden to be a fan of Zuckerberg. Trump has been known to get personal, and being on his hit list as the sitting President might not fare well for Meta. Still, some might argue that Meta is relatively cheap at just 24x forward earnings and 9x sales.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Renewable Energy Stocks to Sell Ahead of a Trump-Vance Win",
        "content": "Over the long term, clean energy should continue to be a growing sector. The world needs more electricity, and that will especially be true given the increasing power demand in sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs) and artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no guarantee that the growth curve will be a stable one. In fact, historically, there have been numerous booms and busts within sectors such as solar and wind power. And another bust may soon be upon us, at least for the United States renewable energy market.\n\nThere were already troubling macroeconomic factors, such as high interest rates which have dimmed demand for expensive new power projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPolitics is another major concern. Former President Trump has taken a lead in the polls. And his pick for vice president, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, is a climate change skeptic whose policy proposals could significantly impede the green power sector. These are three renewable energy stocks to sell before the presidential election.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a lot of things, with electric vehicles being by far its most prominent business. However, it\u2019s also a renewable energy company through items such as the Powerwall and its supercharging network.\n\nThe bad news for Telsa is that a potential Trump/Vance presidency could cripple multiple lines of Tesla operations.\n\nFor starters, Trump recently criticized electric vehicles, slamming what he called the \u201cgreen new scam\u201d while vowing to end EV mandates on day one. Meanwhile, Vance has introduced legalization which would offer large subsidies to support the sale of traditional gas-powered vehicles.\n\nElon Musk has offered a prominent endorsement for Trump this election cycle and appears fine with the selection of Vance as VP as well. This could come back to haunt Tesla\u2019s shareholders, particularly if items such as the gas-powered car subsidies become law.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has been a bright spot in an otherwise grim industry this year. While the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) is down more than 20% year-to-date, FSLR stock has rallied sharply in recent months.\n\nFirst Solar used to be a broadly diversified solar business with a significant project development business. However, the company exited its other operations to focus solely on solar panel manufacturing.\n\nSpecifically, First Solar has focused on higher-end panels that deliver the most efficient power production, helping them stand out from cheaper overseas-sourced competition. That has served the company well during the Biden administration, as there has been a favorable regulatory and financial situation for First Solar\u2019s panels.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s reliance on just a few key markets (mostly the U.S. and India) put it at great risk from changing political winds. That brings attention to the upcoming presidential election. If the Trump ticket carries the day, we should expect to see American solar subsidies run dry and First Solar to take a much harder hit than the overall solar sector.\n\nFreyr Battery (FREY) Person holding smartphone with logo of Norwegian battery company Freyr AS (FREY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFreyr Battery (NYSE:FREY) is a development-stage battery company. It is attempting to commercialize battery storage projects which will aid global decarbonization efforts. But Freyr has not achieved much commercial success to date.\n\nThe firm recently beat its earnings estimates for Q1, which seems like a positive \u2014 at first. In said quarter, the company lost just 20 cents per share, compared to the estimate for a 22-cent loss. Though, it seems, some of this can be accounted for by the fact that Freyr is having to downsize projects and lay off employees to cut costs.\n\nHowever, the bigger issue is that Freyr generated no revenues at all for the quarter. Meanwhile, at a quarterly loss of 20 cents per share, the company will burn through a large chunk of its remaining market capitalization over the next year or two.\n\nFreyr has largely given up on its overseas projects to bet everything on its U.S.-based manufacturing plans. If the Democrats retain control of the presidency, those bets could pay off nicely. But if Trump comes back to power, Freyr may lose access to its last financial lifeline as renewable energy subsidies get axed from the budget.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Hyperloop Stocks Accelerating Transportation",
        "content": "More than a decade has elapsed since the conception of hyperloop transportation entered the public domain. This innovative and technologically advanced concept encountered skepticism from investors and faced significant challenges during its implementation.\n\nHowever, progress in this domain has remained steadfast. The initial shareholders of hyperloop stocks will hold in their hands a transportation method for passengers and cargo that promises to be more economical than road vehicles and faster than the majority of cargo aircraft.\n\nThe potential for creating an alternative to the four primary modes of transportation is so promising that private companies in this sector limit access to a broader range of investors for their projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNevertheless, it is possible to engage indirectly in the advancements of hyperloop technology.\n\nThe creation of such structures from scratch is possible only with the participation of companies specializing in modern lightweight and strong materials, vacuum systems, high-energy-density batteries and aerospace technologies. Visionary investors are already focusing on engineering and consulting firms capable of executing projects of this magnitude.\n\nAECOM (ACM) Outside view of an A.C. Moore Arts & Crafts store\n\nSource: J. Michael Jones / Shutterstock.com\n\nUltra-fast transportation requires planning, architectural and engineering design to build complex infrastructure. AECOM (NYSE:ACM) can handle global construction and energy projects, which is best suited for hyperloop projects.\n\nThe opening of a network of stations for such a system may take time, but the company is catching the eye right now. A \u201cBuy\u201d consensus rating from eight rating firms is the best evidence of this.\n\nACM\u2019s almost four-fold increase in price since 2020 may be alarming to conservative investors, but the winning streak continues. Most analysts are inclined to assume that the stock\u2019s price target is above $100 and market sentiment will be bullish.\n\nInstitutional investors have been highly appreciative of the prospects of hyperloop stocks and are enthusiastic about working with AECOM, as they collectively own 85.41% of the shares. Financial giants such as BNP Paribas Asset Management Holding S.A. and Quent Capital LLC have increased their position, which demonstrates their confidence in ACM\u2019s future.\n\nBombardier (BBD-B) A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.\n\nSource: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.com\n\nHyperloop technologies are at the intersection of many fields, and the aerospace industry is a significant beneficiary of their implementation. Bombardier (TSE:BBD-B) has been engaged in transportation equipment for more than a century and has a market capitalization of $6.81 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s aircraft structural components and engineering services have made it a global name, and the opening of a new market could take the company above its 2000-2001 peak.\n\nBombardier\u2019s commitment to innovation and countless instances of adapting to market challenges could lead BBD-B to the top hyperloop stocks shortly.\n\nIn the spring, the stock showed a 59% rise in 30 days and is now accumulating strength for the next jump. The 52-week range of $39.87 \u2013 $97.86 shows the strength of the uptrend, which intensified in April-May 2024.\n\nSince the end of 2020, BBD-B has shown an example of how high-tech projects can be profitable not only in the AI sector. During this period, the stock has risen from $7 to $95, which means a 13-fold increase.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 estimates point to 37% growth in the next 3 years. If we add to this the company\u2019s capabilities in terms of hyperloop transportation, the picture for investment is extremely rosy.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2013, the world admired the ambitious plans of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) co-founder to build a hyperloop that could take passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than half an hour.\n\nDespite raising about $450 million, Hyperloop One went out of business in 2023, which was a serious blow to the potentially multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that we can give up on the idea of trains capable of reaching speeds of up to 760 mph. The developments are progressing, but their realization requires the production of high-tech batteries. Tesla creates state-of-the-art accumulators and aeronautical solutions that resonate with the needs of hyperloop projects.\n\nThe market capitalization of $791.65 billion describes the company\u2019s enormous influence and explains its ability to drive technological progress.\n\nThe main focus is on electric vehicles, and Tesla successfully competes with industry giants such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F) and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY).\n\nTSLA\u2019s 65% recovery over the past 3 months results from the company\u2019s updates and the market\u2019s reaction to the excess of deliveries in Q2 2024. Tesla has reached a record level of energy storage capacity over the past 2 quarters and is a promising leader among hyperloop stocks.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJulia Magas is a writer who covers the latest trends in finance and technology.

        "title": "Elon Musk May Tank Tesla: 3 EV Stocks That Are Better Bets",
        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) market is in its transitional period. New companies are entering the market, competition is getting fiercer every day, and the market is no longer dominated by a single powerhouse like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Specifically, Chinese EV manufacturers are growing in popularity, and their presence and sales are growing globally. As a result, EV stocks are becoming more diverse and competitive. In fact, it\u2019s been almost a year since Chinese EV powerhouse BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) overtook Tesla\u2019s number one EV seller spot.\n\nAs a whole, the EV market had a poor year in 2023. Due to macroeconomic conditions, the demand for overall electric vehicles has gone down and customers are simply not as excited as they were when EVs first came out. While the growth of electric vehicles has slowed down, according to industry data, the industry is still growing and there is still potential. Especially considering that the electric vehicle market is heavily dependent on interest rates, and the Fed is expected to start rate cuts soon, investors look into buying EV stocks. Below are the three best electric vehicles stocks to buy instead of Tesla.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is an electric vehicle manufacturer based in Beijing, China. The EV maker specializes in premium and luxury SUVs, and putting strong emphasis on long range electric vehicles. Li Auto has been dominating the Chinese EV market, and while the company has publicly stated it will take time before expanding overseas, it announced plans to open its first after-sales service store in Kazakhstan this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of recent sales records, there is a lot to like about Li Auto. In June 2024, Li Auto delivered 47,774 vehicles, an impressive 46.7% increase year-over-year. This contributed to over 100,000 deliveries in the second quarter, which was up more than 25% from Q2 2023.\n\nWhile the stock price stands just under $20 as of writing, analyst ratings indicate a new target price for Li Auto at $34.95. Li Auto has momentum, and with the expected interest cuts in the near future, its sales and revenues are only going to accelerate.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) is another EV stock that should be on investors\u2019 watchlist. While the stock is down nearly 50% year-to-date as of writing, there are still reasons to be bullish about Nio.\n\nLast month alone, Nio delivered 21,209 vehicles last month, which was a 98.1% increase from the previous year. Moreover, in the second quarter of 2024, the Chinese EV pioneer achieved 143.9% growth in sales YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nio primarily focuses on luxury EVs, its management is expanding the product line to stay competitive in the market. Intended to target the masses, Nio will start to offer more affordable EVs with a starting price tag under $30,000. This car will be under Nio\u2019s new sub-brand Onvo, and Nio\u2019s new model L60 is 10% cheaper than its intended competitor Tesla\u2019s Model Y. This strategic expansion will help increase Nio\u2019s customer base.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is the leading electric vehicle seller globally, owning 18% of the global EV market. On top of being the largest EV seller in the world, BYD is also ranked as the second biggest power battery producer. This is a field that BYD has been investing in aggressively, and compared to the past year, BYD\u2019s installed power capacity and energy storage batteries went up by more than 35% as of writing.\n\nOne of the main positives is its adaptability and growth in nondomestic markets. While most of its sales are made domestically, BYD has been expanding its presence into foreign markets recently, threatening established Western EV makers like Tesla. In June 2024, BYD sold 26,995 vehicles overseas, a 156.22% increase YOY. In the second quarter of 2024 as a whole, BYD sold nearly 1,000,000 new energy vehicles (NEV), which was 57.56% up from the previous quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: This Could Be the Best-Performing EV Stock Through 2030",
        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) stocks have been on a bumpy ride recently. But as Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) journey proves, there's huge upside potential for companies that get it right. If you want your portfolio to benefit, you'll need to separate potential winners from the growing list of failed EV ventures.\n\nLooking ahead to 2030, there's one EV stock in particular that I love.\n\nOne thing EV investors must know\n\nIf you want broad exposure to the electric vehicle industry, you can always buy a diversified EV ETF. But there are several problems with this approach. The biggest is the huge variation in what the sector's individual players have to offer. Tesla, for instance, is much more than an electric vehicle company. It has business segments focused on distributed solar, utility-scale battery storage, autonomous driving software, and charging infrastructure. Companies like Lucid Group, meanwhile, are pure plays on electric vehicles, with futures entirely dependent on their ability to design, manufacture, market, and sell EVs to customers.\n\nThis industry is also capital intensive, and there's huge variation in these companies' access to capital. As a more mature competitor, Tesla is generating earnings and operating cash flow. Its $775 billion market cap, meanwhile, allows it to sell shares and tap debt markets much more efficiently than its smaller competitors can. Again, consider Lucid, with its market cap of just $9 billion. It is losing money on the bottom line and is bleeding billions of dollars every year from an operating cash flow perspective.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it's important to know what you're betting on when investing in an EV stock. You must know exactly what the company needs to succeed in the years to come, as well as how well it is financially equipped to stay afloat in an industry where companies typically generate billions of dollars in losses for years before realizing any profits -- if they make it out of the red at all.\n\nThis EV stock is your best long-term bet\n\nFor the combination of high growth potential and reliable access to long-term capital, few EV stocks can match Rivian Automotive(NASDAQ: RIVN). Several months ago, I highlighted its extremely attractive valuation following an industrywide correction. Since then, Rivian shares have nearly doubled in value, but it's not too late to get involved. Shares still trade at just 3.3 times sales. Tesla, by comparison, trades at 9.1 times sales, while Lucid trades at 13.4 times sales. But when you dig deeper, there's even more to love.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from a relatively attractive valuation, Rivian enjoys some of the best customer loyalty in the industry. While it only has a couple of models on the market currently, it has received a J.D. Power award for most satisfying ownership experience, and was named one of the most beloved car brands by Consumer Reports. Around 86% of owners say they'd buy a Rivian again. That's the best rate of any car brand, EV or otherwise.\n\nRivian currently only has a handful of pricey models available. But that's set to change over the next two to three years. It recently unveiled its upcoming R2, R3, and R3X models. Then it announced it had received an $827 million incentive package from the state of Illinois to expand its manufacturing operation there. And the Biden administration's major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles will only serve to boost domestic demand for Rivian's models.\n\nIn regard to access to capital, Rivian has an ace up its sleeve. During a 2019 funding round, it signed Amazon as a major investor. In 2021, it closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund. And just last month, the company formed a joint venture that will see global automaker Volkswagen invest an initial $1 billion into Rivian, with up to $4 billion in additional investments planned over the coming years.\n\nNow a public company, Rivian has access to the equity market, so it can raise funds through secondary stock offerings. But it also has a stable of deep-pocketed, long-term investors -- something many other EV start-ups lack. The advantage of capital should not go under appreciated. Just last month, EV maker Fisker filed for bankruptcy, citing high costs and lower-than-expected industry growth. As Tesla proved, EV companies must be able to invest heavily at a loss for years before profits emerge. Tesla didn't post a full year profit until 2020, 12 years after Musk took over as CEO. During that time span, Tesla was able to boost its annual research and development budget from $200 million to $1.3 billion even as the losses accumulated.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Rivian has generated around $5 billion in sales. It's still losing $39,000 for every vehicle it makes, though that is a sizable improvement from the year before when it lost $67,000 per vehicle. These losses are partially a reflection of Rivian's relatively small size. It's delivering around 14,000 vehicles per quarter, while Tesla is delivering nearly 400,000 vehicles per quarter.\n\nDespite the current losses, the growth potential for Rivian is clear. With a suite of more affordable models coming to market in 2025 and 2026, plus ample avenues to continue raising capital to support these launches, Rivian looks like a great EV stock for patient growth investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as heavyweight technology stocks rebounded from a recent rout, although Chinese markets lagged as sentiment towards the country showed little improvement.\n\nRegional markets tracked a strong overnight session on Wall Street, which was supported chiefly by a rebound in heavyweight tech shares. Focus was squarely on upcoming quarterly earnings from tech majors Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), due later in the day.\n\nU.S. stock index futures drifted lower in Asian trade, as sentiment still remained weak amid uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections.\n\nTech supports Asian stocks, but barely\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.2%, while the broader TOPIX added 0.5% on strength in technology stocks. Regional chipmaking stocks in particular tracked a rebound in artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nTaiwan shares of TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker, surged 2.7% after losing nearly 7% in the past five sessions. Shares of the firm had taken little support from positive second-quarter earnings.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI added 0.3%. Producer price index inflation data showed factory inflation grew slightly in June.\n\nBut while tech-heavy indexes saw some relief on Tuesday, they were still nursing steep declines over the past week, as bets on interest rate cuts saw investors rotate into sectors more likely to benefit from an economic recovery.\n\nAsian stocks were also battered by weak risk appetite amid increased uncertainty over the U.S. presidential race, after President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump said Harris will be easier to defeat. He was also seen polling ahead of Biden and Harris according to CBS and HarrisX data, although this was prior to Biden\u2019s pulling out.\n\nA rotation into economically sensitive sectors still remained in play on Tuesday. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 added 0.7% on gains in heavyweight banks and mining stocks.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open, as a weak rupee and optimism over the Indian economy kept the index and the BSE Sensex 30 near record highs.\n\nThe Indian government is also set to present its budget for 2024 later in the day, which may spark some volatility in local markets.\n\nChinese stocks lag as economic uncertainty, Trump fears persist\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Hang Seng index shed 0.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentiment towards China showed little signs of improving despite a surprise interest rate cut by the People\u2019s Bank of China on Monday, with analysts stating that the cut was too small to make too much difference.\n\nThe Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party largely underwhelmed investors, as Beijing unveiled few details on plans for more stimulus.\n\nBut a main point of weight on Chinese markets was speculation over a Trump presidency. Trump has maintained a largely hardline stance against China, and could impose more trade restrictions, drawing ire from Beijing.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks buoyed by tech rebound; China lags\n\nCybersecurity firm Wiz walks away from $23 billion deal with Google, memo says\n\nAnalysis-Drug giants eye China for deals despite growing Sino-US tensions",

        "title": "Time to Buy Tesla, GM, or Ford's Stock as Q2 Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "Second quarter results from the major automakers will be a highlight of this week\u2019s earnings lineup with Tesla TSLA and General Motors GM set to report on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nPlus, Q2 results from Ford Motor F are on tap Wednesday. That said, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy stock in these auto giants as earnings approach.\n\nTesla Q2 Expectations\n\nNotably, Tesla\u2018s stock has been on a monstrous rally soaring over +20% in the last month. This comes as Tesla announced it delivered 443,956 EVs during Q2 which topped most analyst estimates although this was down from 466,140 deliveries in the prior year quarter.\n\nFueling the extended rally was increased deliveries from Chinese EV automakers such as Nio NIO and Li Auto LI with Tesla\u2019s factory in Shanghai being critical to its production as well. However, Tesla\u2019s Q2 EPS is expected at $0.62 compared to $0.91 a share in the comparative quarter. This is despite quarterly sales projected to rise to $25.13 billion versus $24.93 billion in Q2 2023. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ2 Expectations for GM & Ford\n\nAs shown in Tesla\u2019s price performance chart above, General Motors and Ford\u2019s stock have also seen nice momentum leading up to their Q2 reports.\n\nBoth iconic automakers saw a hefty increase in elective vehicle sales with General Motors\u2019 EV deliveries spiking 40% during Q2 to 21,930. As for Ford, its Q2 EV deliveries soared 61% year over year to 23,957.\n\nMore impressive, General Motors' Q2 EPS is projected to expand 38% to $2.64 on sales of $44.94 billion, a slight increase from $44.75 billion a year ago. Following a tougher-to-compete-against prior-year quarter, Ford\u2019s Q2 EPS is expected to decline -14% to $0.62 with sales forecasted to dip -2% to $41.65 billion.\n\nValuation Comparisons\n\nIn terms of valuation, General Motors and Ford certainly stand out trading at just 5.1X and 6.9X forward earnings, respectively. It\u2019s noteworthy that both GM and Ford have an \u201cA\u201d Zacks Style Scores grade for Value. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill commanding a noticeable premium to the broader market as an EV pioneer, Tesla\u2019s stock trades at a 96.4X forward earning multiple which is below its two-year high of 141.2X but above its median of 76.3X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAhead of their Q2 reports, General Motors and Ford\u2019s stock both sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Now looks like an opportunistic time to invest in General Motors and Ford considering their EV growth and cheap P/E valuations.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla\u2019s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) after such an extensive rally over the last few months. To that point, longer-term investors may still be rewarded for holding Tesla\u2019s stock but there could certainly be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We Need Robotaxis, And We Need Them Now: Tesla's Stock Price Plummet Proves It\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk had the world buzzing with excitement over the announcement of his new Robotaxi, but delay after delay caused Tesla's stock price to plummet. Let\u2019s make one thing very clear: the world is ready for the Robotaxi, and they need it now. Here's what happened.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nIn April this year, tech giant entrepreneur Elon Musk announced on his social media platform X that the Robotaxi would arrive on Aug. 8, 2024. During the company's earnings report, Tesla released a sneak peek of what to expect, and it was fair to say it captured the world's attention. On five big screens, Tesla revealed some key features of the long-gestating Robotaxi that comes with an app similar to Uber but with Tesla's unique style. The autonomous vehicle is currently being built on Tesla's next-generation vehicle platform and is part of the \"Tesla Network.\"\n\nMusk revealed that the taxis operated by Tesla will be like a \"combination of Airbnb and Uber\" and that customers can also use these cars. Musk explains, \"There will be a bunch of cars where they're owned by the end user,\" he added, \"But that end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want.\" By doing this, Musk has created an opportunity for Tesla vehicle owners to generate income while at work or on vacation, capturing many people's attention. During the first quarter earnings call, Musk explained his belief about this revolutionary passenger-hailing idea, \"in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone.\"\n\nTrending: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nBut so far, that's been it, and Musk has not released any further details until now. His August 8 announcement on X helped Tesla\u2019s shares rise by 4.9% that day and 60% just two days later.\n\nThen Bloomberg News reported that the unveiling of Robotaxi had been pushed from August 8 to October, but no actual date was given. Following Bloomberg's announcement, Tesla's shares dropped 8.4%. However, it wasn't just Tesla that suffered a blow to the stock market. It was also Musk himself. On Thursday, the 11th, the value of his 20.5% stake in Tesla fell from $188.24 billion to $172.34 billion, which was a whopping $16 billion drop. According to The Street, Tesla's stock plummeting was the worst among stocks in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 Index.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: This Income Stock Has Outperformed The S&P 500 For Over A Decade\n\nBloomberg announced the delay, citing that the team working on the project \"needed more time to build additional prototypes.\" Musk has confirmed the delay and claimed that design changes are the cause of the delay. In a social media post, Musk wrote, \u201cRequested what I think is an important design change to the front, and extra time allows us to show off a few other things.\"\n\nBut this isn't the first time that Musk and Tesla have made big announcements that have amounted to nothing. Back in 2019, Musk had promised that Tesla would have over a million robotaxis on the road in 2020. Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor, told Reuters, \"Tesla has been playing this game for nearly a decade, promising \u2018next year, next year.\u2019\" He pointed out, \"And I've seen no indication that Tesla ... is on track for a meaningful deployment of the kind of automated driving system that Tesla has consistently promised.\"\n\nWhile there's still so much uncertainty about when we'll expect an autonomous Robotaxi, there's no uncertainty that we need them, and Tesla's plummeting stock is proof of that.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in evening deals on Monday, steadying after a sharp rebound on Wall Street as investors returned to technology stocks ahead of key earnings from the sector.\n\nWall Street indexes were still trading well below record highs hit last week, as a mix of profit-taking and rotation into more economically-sensitive sectors battered tech in recent sessions.\n\nThe second quarter earnings season is now widely expected to dictate tech\u2019s trajectory in the coming weeks.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,605.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,955.75 points by 19:51 ET (23:51 GMT). Dow Jones Futures were flat at 40,680.0 points.\n\nAlphabet, Tesla set to report Q2 earnings\n\nFocus was now squarely on upcoming earnings prints from tech majors Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), due on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet is set to offer more cues on how Wall Street\u2019s internet giants are benefiting from artificial intelligence, as well as how much they are spending on developing the new technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s earnings are set to show how the electric vehicle maker is navigating a sharp decrease in demand, while focus will also be on its promises of AI-driven autonomous driving and robotaxis.\n\nBeyond the two tech giants, a slew of other Wall Street majors are set to report on Tuesday, including Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and Freeport-McMoran Copper&Gold Inc (NYSE:FCX).\n\nWall St benefits from tech rebound, but uncertainties persist\n\nA large rotation back into technology stocks saw Wall Street rebound on Monday, although benchmark indexes still remained well below recent peaks.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 1.1% to 5,564.41 points, while the NASDAQ Composite surged 1.6% to 18,007.57 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 40,415.44 points.\n\nGrowing optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September saw investors pivot into sectors more likely to benefit from an economic recovery.\n\nBut uncertainty over the U.S. political outlook increased after President Joe Biden said he will not seek reelection, instead endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nRecent polls showed Republican nominee Donald Trump was polling ahead of Biden and Harris, although it was unclear whether Harris\u2019 nomination will shift this trend.\n\nSpeculation over a Trump presidency also drove flows into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures dip after tech rebound; Alphabet, Tesla earnings loom\n\nUS congressional panel calls on CrowdStrike CEO to testify on outage\n\nPorsche lowers 2024 outlook, warns of impairments on alloy shortage",

        "content": "Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) shares have been a bit of a roller-coaster ride this year. After dropping more than 40% and bottoming as low as nearly $140 per share in April, Tesla stock has recovered to hold a year-to-date gain heading into its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nTesla reports its full second-quarter update tomorrow after the market closes, and investors will be listening closely. The anticipation has Tesla shares jumping to start this week's trading. As of 3:15 p.m. ET, the stock had surged by 5%. Some of that also has to do with election year politics, and what that could mean for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.\n\nElon Musk is hedging Tesla's bets\n\nTesla's gain of nearly 80% since April 22 came as investors anticipate an update on its full self-driving software, and after surprisingly strong second-quarter vehicle deliveries. The company delivered almost 444,000 EVs in the quarter while also drawing down vehicle inventories. The result could be a more profitable quarterly period than many analysts initially expected.\n\nAnd CEO Elon Musk is also making news with his public comments on U.S. politics. After recently endorsing former President Donald Trump, Musk doubled down on his support this weekend. Trump has responded with a much warmer opinion on EVs in general. At a rally over the weekend, the formerly anti-EV president said, \"I love Elon Musk, I'm constantly talking about electric cars. ... I'm totally for them.\"\n\nWhile the election is far from decided, it seems Musk is working to position the EV sector, and his company in particular, for any potential outcome. While a future Trump presidency might mean less government support and subsidies, Tesla is the one profitable EV maker that could tolerate reduced tax credits and other assistance for EV buyers.\n\nBut more imminent is what Tesla will say about EV profits, energy storage deployments, and self-driving technology tomorrow. Some investors are anticipating good news and jumping into the stock ahead of that report.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "What does the rotation out of tech mean for tech earnings?\n\nLast week began with investors continuing to rotate out of tech after a massive growth year thus far, and ended with a broader sell-off. With tech earnings on deck, that may change if results support the rich valuations for sported by many of those mega tech names. The Nasdaq fell 4% last week while the S&P 500 was down over 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just about flat after rallying more than 700 points on Tuesday, its best day in over a year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nCurrently, S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology, two of the sectors taking the biggest hits last week (along with Consumer Discretionary), are expected to be the leaders of second-quarter earnings season. Investors may be waiting to see if earnings results will justify high price-earnings levels. With expectations so high, these names will likely have to put up healthy beats to impress shareholders.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 earnings per share growth is for 9.70% year over year, an increase from 9.30% last week.[1] Thus far, 80% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 62% have beaten on revenue.[2]\n\nCEO uncertainty remains high\n\nAfter falling to its lowest level in its nine years in the first quarter of 2024, the Late Earnings Report Index, our proprietary measure of CEO uncertainty, is back up for the second quarter in a row for the third quarter.\n\nThe LERI tracks outlier earnings date changes among publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of $250 million and higher. The LERI has a baseline reading of 100, anything above that indicates companies are feeling uncertain about their current and short-term prospects. A LERI reading under 100 suggests companies feel they have a pretty good crystal ball for the near term.\n\nThe official pre-peak season LERI reading for the second quarter (data collected in the third quarter) stands at 161, well above the baseline reading, suggesting companies are feeling less certain about economic conditions than they were at the beginning of the year. Some of that uncertainty was evident in banking commentary made over the last couple of weeks. As of July 12, there were 66 late outliers and 37 early outliers. Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nBig tech on deck\n\nThis week we start to get results from several Magnificent Seven and other big tech names including: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). This comes just as investor's start to rotate out of these mega-cap winners into smaller names that they believe will benefit more greatly from interest rate cuts potentially coming as soon as next month.\n\nStory continues Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nLate earnings date confirmation\n\nWhen a company is late to confirm their quarterly earnings date, it could be valuable information for current or prospective inventors to know.\n\nReleased in 2022, Wall Street Horizon's Confirmation Timing uses historical data to project an expected confirmation date and the normal range that enables the identification of:\n\nCompanies that have not yet confirmed an earnings date and are materially late compared to their historical trends and behaviors. Announced earnings dates in which the Confirmation Timing is materially earlier or later than the company's historical average of the same quarter.\n\nCompanies that tend to stall on confirming their earnings dates also tend to set later-than-usual earnings dates, which academic research has shown highly correlates to bad news being shared on the call.[3]\n\n??The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nIn recent years, Disney has confirmed its second-quarter earnings date around July 5 with a standard deviation of +/- 3.70 days. The company ended up confirming its second-quarter earnings date, Aug. 7 BMO, on July 18, which was 14 days past the mean confirmation day. While the earnings date itself is within the historical range of expected earnings dates, the delay in confirming that date could point to a hesitant management team.\n\nEarlier in the year Disney was embroiled in a proxy battle which ended in April as the entertainment behemoth fended off activist investor Nelson Peltz (Trades, Portfolio), who attempted to secure board seats. Following a vote at its annual shareholder meeting, the company announced the current Disney board would remain as is.[4]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 16, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,445 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 60% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.

        "content": "Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP\n\nA prominent tech investor predicted that NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade.\n\nWhat Happened: James Anderson, an early investor in companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), expressed his bullish outlook on Nvidia\u2019s future potential, reported the Financial Times on Sunday. He suggested that the chipmaker\u2019s market cap could potentially surpass the combined value of the current S&P 500.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nAnderson\u2019s optimism stems from Nvidia\u2019s role in the burgeoning demand for AI chips, which are crucial for training and running advanced generative AI models. This demand has propelled Nvidia\u2019s shares to soar by 168% since the beginning of the year, pushing its market value above $3 trillion.\n\n\"The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions. This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" Anderson said.\n\nFor context, Anderson\u2019s prediction of Nvidia hitting $50 trillion market capitalization would be nearly twice as much as the U.S.\u2019s current gross domestic product (GDP), which stands at $27.36 trillion, or nearly thrice as much as China\u2019s GDP of $17.79 trillion, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nDespite this remarkable growth, Anderson views Nvidia\u2019s potential as even greater, provided that artificial intelligence continues to deliver for customers and Nvidia maintains its lead in the industry.\n\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nAnderson, who now runs a $650 million fund at Lingotto Investment Management, believes that Nvidia\u2019s \u201cpersistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged that the path to this potential valuation would be volatile, with possible drawdowns of 35-40%. However, he expressed confidence in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stating that the company is at the forefront of solving serious problems in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and drug discovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnderson projected that the actual growth in demand for data center AI chips was currently around 60% annually. Looking forward over the next decade, he estimated that sustained 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, could lead to earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 per share.\n\nTrending:Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.\n\nAssuming a 5% free cash flow yield, this analysis suggests that Nvidia shares could potentially be valued at $20,000 in 10 years, implying a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned a probability of 10-15% to achieve this scenario, according to the report.\n\nWhy It Matters: The prediction from Anderson comes amid a broader context of excitement and caution in the market. The U.S. stock market has experienced a significant rally, largely driven by the promise of AI. This surge has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with the S&P 500 index hitting new highs and the Nasdaq Composite index rising by 70% since the end of 2022.\n\nSee Also: This Income Stock Has Outperformed The S&P 500 For Over A Decade\n\nHowever, not everyone is optimistic. Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, has pointed out \u201cwarning flags\u201d in the market, suggesting that Nvidia might be in \u201cbubble-ish territory\u201d and hinting at a potential market pullback.\n\nEven Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has acknowledged Nvidia\u2019s exceptional performance but forecasts \u201cshort-term indigestion\u201d for the company\u2019s business as customers reassess their AI strategies.\n\nDespite these concerns, some analysts remain bullish. Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, has a price target of $200 on Nvidia stock, citing the company\u2019s pivotal role in the AI space.\n\nAnderson gained prominence during his nearly four-decade tenure at Baillie Gifford. He oversaw its flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which initially invested in Nvidia in 2016. His leadership played a pivotal role in transforming the Edinburgh-based private partnership into an unexpected standout in the tech investment sector.\n\nRead Next:\n\nRory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP originally appeared on Benzinga.com",

        "content": "SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) stock is down 90% from where it stood one year ago. Not only does it mean the business has fallen on hard times but there are likely few investors left after the rout.\n\nYet Wall Street remains remarkably upbeat about SolarEdge stock. Depending upon who is counting, analysts have consensus price targets implying the residential solar inverter company will double or triple in value over the coming year.\n\nEven those analysts with more grounded targets see plenty of upside ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, if the dominoes fall into place as forecast and the bullish scenario plays out, don\u2019t hang on. Instead, view it as a chance to deploy your money else into more profitable ventures.\n\nGoing From Bad to Worse\n\nThe stars have not aligned for SolarEdge Technologies. High interest rates caused the cost of financing new solar panel installations to become uneconomical. Sales of inverters, the devices that convert a solar panel\u2019s direct current into alternating current that can be used in a home, plummeted.\n\nSolarEdge\u2019s solar segment revenue started collapsing in the third quarter of 2023 and only worsened since. With first-quarter 2024 segment sales down 33% year-over-year versus a 9% gain in the year-ago period, there is no reason to expect the current quarter\u2019s results to be much better.\n\nIndeed, management recently reiterated its Q2 earnings guidance, which forecast solar segment sales of $225 million to $255 million for the period.\n\nThat indicates a 75% drop at the midpoint. As the inverter maker may report results at the end of July or in early August, SolarEdge stock will not be turning higher soon.\n\nWall Street also isn\u2019t expecting much improvement until 2025. Even if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates sooner than expected, the solar industry\u2019s recovery may be short-lived.\n\nSolar Incentives On the Chopping Block\n\nWhile interest rate cuts would be a positive development, a lot depends on their magnitude. A quarter percentage point reduction here and there won\u2019t materially reduce the cost of financing a new solar installation.\n\nArguably, an even bigger threat would be a Republican sweep of the November elections.\n\nThey have promised to gut President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and former President Donald Trump has vowed to cut at least some of the green energy tax credits that have been enacted.\n\nOther politicians have called for \u201cdismantling \u2026 green corporate welfare.\u201d\n\nTrump has an ally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who also backs eliminating subsidies for companies in the electric vehicle industry and elsewhere.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is expected Musk may play an advisory role in a second Trump presidency. If Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House, it will be an easy path to make good on those threats.\n\nOf course, Republicans also threatened to undo former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act during Trump\u2019s first presidency and then largely did nothing.\n\nHowever, environmental policy is much easier to repeal than health care as it would not have such sweeping impact on individuals.\n\nThere Is No Coming Back\n\nSolarEdge Technologies finds itself in a very bad spot. It recently announced one of its customers declared bankruptcy and owes it $11.4 million. It will be a long time, if ever, that it receives payment.\n\nThe inverter maker followed that by announcing it was firing 400 employees. That comes on top of a previous 16% reduction of its workforce.\n\nSolarEdge stock did get some good news, though. BoA Securities analyst Dimple Gosai raised her rating on the company to neutral from underperform. However, she also lowered her target price from $44 per share to $29.\n\nGosai believes the severe drop in SolarEdge stock was overdone. It prices in \u201can unlikely worst-case scenario of inventory write downs, a lack of recovery in the inventory channel congestion through \u201925 and an inability to monetize the balance sheet,\u201d according to Barron\u2019s.\n\nThis despite SEDG CEO Zivi Lando saying the inventory issue is going to take time to work through. Even SolarEdge\u2019s European market is under significant pressure.\n\nThere are no good options for SolarEdge Technologies on the horizon. That means any bump higher in SolarEdge stock should be used as an opportunity to cut your losses and run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview: Spotlight on GDP, PCE data and earnings",
        "content": "U.S. stocks ended Friday trading in the red as Wall Street concluded a week characterized by a shift from this year\u2019s megacap winners to smaller names.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell by 0.71%, closing at 5,505.00. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.81%, ending at 17,726.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 377.49 points, or 0.93%, to 40,287.53.\n\nFriday\u2019s declines were widespread, with the Russell 2000 also down by 0.63%. Despite this, the focus on stocks expected to benefit more from potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, such as small caps, remained prominent throughout the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced their largest weekly losses since April, falling by 1.97% and 3.65%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also ended a six-week winning streak. On the other hand, the Dow gained 0.72%, and the small-cap index Russell 2000 rose by 1.68%.\n\nThe upcoming week promises to be eventful, with several key economic indicators set to be released. The main focus will likely be on the preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data for the second quarter, scheduled for Thursday, with many economists expecting an uptick.\n\nFurthermore, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, one of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauges, will be released on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe expect a modest acceleration from the 1.5% growth pace in 1Q to 2.0% last quarter,\u201d JPMorgan economists said in a note.\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s June core PCE inflation report is expected to show a 0.2%m/m increase in prices last month, leaving the year-ago increase unchanged at 2.6%,\u201d they added.\n\nApart from this, investors will closely monitor the presidential election, especially following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race. His decision opens the possibility of an open convention, although the consensus is that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is the frontrunner for the nomination.\n\nAlphabet and Tesla to report earnings this week\n\nAs earnings season begins, the tech-focused S&P 500 faces challenges not only from the rotation into small caps but also from potential selling pressure from trend followers.\n\nThis week, several big S&P 500 companies are set to unveil their latest quarterly performance, and with the current high expectations, any misses could prompt trend followers to sell off their stretched long positions accumulated over the past two months, and weigh further on the benchmark index.\n\nTech giants including Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will both report on Tuesday, and will likely capture the majority of the spotlight. In addition, Visa (NYSE:V), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), 3M, and chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also report earnings in the coming days.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nJPMorgan: \u201cMag-7 EPS growth projections remain punchy, but are set to decelerate somewhat. SPX ex Mag-7 earnings are projected to be positive at +5% y/y, for the first time in 5 quarters. However, we note that the convergence in the earnings delivery was the expectation in each of the last 5 reporting seasons, but the end result was always a bigger positive surprise for Mag-7 than for the rest of the market. This could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again. Within Tech, we reiterate the call from last month to move away from hardware/semis, and into software, on lower yields, on geopolitical uncertainty and given strong past outperformance of Semis.\n\nUBS: \u201cOur base case that the S&P 500 ends the year around 5,900, modestly higher than the current 5,505, would hold in most political scenarios\u2014 barring a Democratic sweep of power that leads to higher corporate taxes, or a scenario in which former President Trump imposes trade tariffs that are as high as proposed in his campaign speeches. We consider either outcome unlikely at present. In addition, we believe the positive outlook for top US tech companies is likely to more than offset political uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo: \u201cPresident Biden has withdrawn from the presidential election following the continued erosion of his support and has endorsed VP Harris as the nominee. Could see modest give-back of \"Trump Trade\" but path likely becomes data-dependent from there.\u201d\n\nLynx Equity Strategies: \u201cWe think the sell-off from last week is likely to reverse somewhat this week. The SOX (vs. SPX outperformance) has cut below a reliable level. The fate of the sector will of course be decided by the earnings reports, the bulk of which arrive only next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cTriggering FDPR is a major change in US trade policy towards nations allied with the US. We think it is unlikely the Biden administration makes major changes to trade policy through the remaining portion of its tenure. As such we think investor fears of draconian changes to US policy towards China exports by US and non-US based companies is likely to ebb. We would be buyers of semis/semicap names.\u201d\n\nYardeni Research: \u201cIt's all quite confusing since investors have been rotating out of Tech and the Magnificent-7 since July 11 when June's lower-than-expect CPI convinced investors to load up on interest-rate sensitive stocks because the Fed is now widely expected to start lowering interest rates in September. We agree, but we also think that could be a one-and-done rate cut for 2024 because the economy remains resilient. For now, we believe that the stock market was overbought and is experiencing a minor selloff.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSX opens higher after Biden opts out of election race\n\nWall St opens higher as investors assess U.S. election after Biden exit",

        "title": "Biden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The volatile U.S. political situation took another turn, with President Joe Biden dropping out of race for re-election. China has attempted to boost its struggling economy but cutting interest rates, while Nvidia is developing an AI chip for the Chinese market.\n\n1. Biden bows out of presidential race; Harris to replace?\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday bowed to what seemed inevitable, and dropped out of the race for re-election amid concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden backed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the job, putting her in pole position for the nomination which is officially scheduled for the Democratic convention on Aug. 19-22.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis talk of unity could see the party consider a virtual nomination ahead of the convention, and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.\n\nGoldman Sachs in a note said they did not expect the Democrats' fiscal and trade policy agenda to shift meaningfully in the event that Harris is the nominee.\n\nHarris could consolidate Black support and bring into sharper focus the differences between the two sides on abortion rights, an issue that has proved significant in other polls.\n\nBut she also faces the full weight of history as she would become the first female and only the second black President, after Barack Obama.\n\n2. Futures edge higher, with tech earnings to the fore\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, bouncing after hefty losses as investors rotated out of the major technology stocks.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 23 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 125 points, or 0.6%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 2% and 3.7%, respectively, marking their biggest weekly losses since April. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%.\n\nThe evolving political situation will remain in focus Monday, but there are more important earnings to digest, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) feature in a busy week for earnings, kicking off results from the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are among some of the other big-name companies set to report during the coming week, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is set to report later Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia developing AI chip for Chinese market - Reuters\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a version of its flagship artificial intelligence chips for Chinese markets that will fall in line with U.S. export restrictions, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker will work with Inspur, one of its biggest distributors in China, on a chip tentatively called the \u201cB20,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s current AI offerings are geared specifically towards falling in line with U.S. export restrictions on China. But recent reports suggested that its offerings in the country, such as the H20, were seeing weak demand amid heavy competition from local chipmakers, specifically Huawei.\n\nIncreased interest in AI development has sparked a revenue bonanza for Nvidia, boosting the company\u2019s valuation to make it among the most valuable companies on Wall Street.\n\n4. PBOC cuts rates to boost the Chinese economy\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its benchmark loan prime rates further into record-low territory on Monday, in an attempt to support the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.35% from 3.45%, while the five-year LPR, which is used to determine mortgage prices, was cut to 3.85% from 3.95%.\n\nThe cuts come just a week after softer-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter ramped up concerns over slowing economic growth, increasing doubts that the central bank\u2019s full-year GDP growth target will be met.\n\nChinese officials had promised more stimulus during the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Third Plenum last week.\n\nSentiment surrounding Chinese markets remains weak though, amid speculation that Donald Trump will win a second term as U.S. president.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely negative stance towards China. His administration had imposed steep tariffs on China, sparking a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\n\nA second term for Trump could entail a similar scenario, which bodes poorly for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n5. Crude market to return to surplus next year - Morgan Stanley\n\nCrude prices rose Monday, boosted by a surprise Chinese interest rate cut [see above], which is aimed at boosting the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.2% to $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, have weighed on the market, especially following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThese gains may not last too long though, as although the crude market is currently tight, next year it will likely be in surplus, with Brent prices declining into the mid-to-high $70s range, Morgan Stanley said.\n\nThe tightness will hold for most of the third quarter, the bank said in a note dated on Friday, but equilibrium will return by the fourth quarter, \"when seasonal demand tailwinds abate and both OPEC and non-OPEC supply return to growth.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley said it expects OPEC and non-OPEC supply to grow by about 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, well ahead of demand growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets\n\nTaiwan June export orders miss forecast, China demand weakens\n\nChina to extend tariff exemptions for some US imports until 2025",

        "title": "Joe Biden dropout fallout, inflation data, and the start of tech earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks pulled back from record highs amid pressure across the technology sector after a global tech outage sent shockwaves throughout the market on Friday.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week down nearly 2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped more than 3.5% on the week. Both indexes had their worst weekly performance since April. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.7%.\n\nThis week, critical readings on economic growth and inflation, as well as the start of Big Tech earnings, will determine if the malaise continues.\n\nInvestors will also be digesting the news that President Joe Biden will no longer be seeking reelection. Biden announced he\u2018s dropping out of the presidental race in a post on X Sunday.\n\nOn the economic data side, the advanced reading of second quarter economic growth is slated for Thursday, followed by the June reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, a slew of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results in a week headlined by Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nInflation outlook\n\nLast week, new data showing a slowdown in inflation prompted markets to put the chances that the Federal Reserve cuts rates by the end of its September meeting at 100%.\n\nThe week ahead will bring another look at inflation, this time with the Fed's preferred gauge: The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index.\n\nDue out on Friday, economists expect \"core\" PCE increased 2.5% in June from the previous year, down from May's 2.6% annual gain. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, slightly above May's 0.1% increase.\n\nThe release comes less than a week before the Fed's next monetary policy decision on July 31. Markets are widely expecting the central bank to hold interest rates steady.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nGrowth check\n\nOne key question on investors' minds is whether the economy can remain resilient with rates still at their most restrictive levels in more than two decades.\n\nThursday will bring the first reading of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter. Economists expect the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the second quarter, up from the 1.4% growth rate seen in the first quarter.\n\nBank of America Securities head of economics Michael Gapen summed up expectations for the upcoming week's data release in a weekly note, writing,\" The data should show healthy activity, and that inflation is moving in the right direction.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSigns of a rotation\n\nSince investors have become more optimistic about the likelihood of multiple interest rate cuts this year, a shift has been underway within the stock market.\n\nIn the past 10 days, Real Estate (XLRE) and Financials (XLF) have led individual sector action. Meanwhile the market's biggest winners of the past year, Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) , have recently been the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500.\n\nAnd the rotation has finally trickled down in cap size too, with small caps joining the 2024 stock market rally.\n\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up about 8% over the past month, while the S&P 500 is up less than 1% in the same time period, sparking debate over whether this bout of small-cap outperformance can continue.\n\n\"We think there is room for the rotation into low quality to persist if rate cuts remain priced and the Trump 2.0 trade carries on ahead of US elections,\" UBS Investment Bank US equity derivatives strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nBig Tech earnings on tap\n\nWith Big Tech stumbling amid the market rotation, the fundamental story for some of the stock market's largest names will be in focus in the week ahead.\n\nTesla and Alphabet are slated to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Second quarter results from the two Magnificent Seven members will provide an early read on investor appetite for the most popular trade of 2023. Both stocks are up double digits over the past six months despite the recent sell-off.\n\nThe question is whether the AI-fueled trajectory upward can continue.\n\n\"The biggest risk heading into the next six to eight weeks is, are we setting ourselves up for this AI disappointment [in earnings]?\" Ryan Grabinski, Strategas Research Partners managing director of investment strategy, told Yahoo Finance. \"Do all of the trades that were associated with AI ultimately begin to unwind themselves?\"\n\nHow Big Tech companies perform will likely determine the trajectory of earnings growth for the broader S&P 500. Four companies \u2014 Alphabet, Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 are expected to grow earnings by 56.4% compared to the same period a year prior, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. The other 496 are expected to grow earnings by just 5.7%.\n\nWhen combining the two groups, the S&P is currently on pace to produce year-over-year earnings growth of 9.7%. This would mark the best quarter for earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, June (-0.06 expected, +0.18 prior)\n\nEarnings: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE), SAP (SAP), Truist (TFC), Verizon (VZ), Zions Bancorporation (ZION)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, July (-7 expected, -10 prior); Existing home sales month-over-month, June (-2.7% expected, -0.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Enphase (ENPH), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), GE Aerospace (GE), General Motors (GM), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Phillip Morris International (PM), Spotify (SPOT), Tesla (TSLA), UPS (UPS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Visa (V)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending July 19 (+3.9% prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, July, preliminary (51.4 expected, 51.6 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, July, preliminary (55 expected, 55.3 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, July, preliminary (54.8 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, June (+3.8% expected, -11.3% previously)\n\nEarnings:  AT&T (T), Chipotle (CMG), Ford (F), IBM (IBM), General Dynamics (GD), Lamb Weston (LW), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), ServiceNow (NOW), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), Waste Management (WM), Whirlpool (WHR)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Second quarter GDP, advance estimate (+1.9% annualized rate expected, +1.4% previously); First quarter personal consumption, advance estimate (+1.7% expected, 1.5% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended, July 20 (243,000 previously); Durable goods, June preliminary (+0.5% expected, +0.1% previously)\n\nEarnings: American Airlines (AAL), AstraZeneca (AZN), Boston Beer (SAM), Deckers (DECK), Hasbro (HAS), Honeywell (HON), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP), New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), RTX (RTX), Skechers (SKX), Southwest (LUV), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), Valero (VLO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Personal income, month-over-month, June (+0.4% expected, +0.5% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, 0% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, June (+2.5% expected, +2.6% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, June (+0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, June (+2.5% expected; +2.6% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, July, final reading (66.3 expected, 66 previously)\n\nEarnings: 3M (MMM), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), Charter Communications (CHTR)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "'Few Democrats willing to buy a Tesla' after Elon Musk backs Trump, investor warns",
        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement of former President Donald Trump isn\u2019t sitting well with potential Tesla (TSLA) customers.\n\nNew data from analytics firm CivicScience shows Tesla\u2019s favorability among Democrats has dropped to 16% as of July 16, compared to 39% in January. Among Republicans, the data shows favorability decreased to 23% from 36% in the same time period.\n\nCivicScience CEO John Dick tells Yahoo Finance its \u201cdata has shown consistently that Democrats, more closely than Republicans, associate Elon Musk and his actions with the brand.\u201d\n\nAnd that could be problematic for the brand's business. Tesla short seller Mark Spiegel told Yahoo Finance a potential boycott from Democrats would be \u201cterrible\u201d for the EV maker.\n\n\u201cHe completely alienated most of his buying base\u2026 It's going to kill the business,\u201d Spiegel warned. \u201cI can't imagine a single Democrat, or, let's say, very few of them, willing to buy a Tesla at this point.\u201d\n\nLongtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki told Yahoo Finance that he's considering selling his vehicle because Musk's endorsement \"doesn\u2019t align with my values.\"\n\n\u201cThis final stance of Elon has put me in a really difficult moral position,\u201d Gerber said. \"I\u2019m driving a Cybertruck and now it's like a MAGA truck.\u201d\n\nAccording to research firm Strategic Vision, the number of Tesla owners who identify as Democrats has dropped to 26% compared to 39% last year. The data shows a dramatic drop in November when Musk made antisemitic comments on X and has steadily decreased since then.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just pushback from Democrats that potentially spells trouble ahead for Tesla. Pros tell Yahoo Finance that threats from former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, to scrap government subsidies will also be a hit to the EV leader.\n\n\u201cIf the $7,500 credit goes away, Tesla is going to have to raise prices. And if it has to raise prices, it's going to sell fewer cars,\u201d Spiegel added.\n\nGuggenheim\u2019s Ron Jewsikow told Yahoo Finance the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit is a \u201ckey affordability enabler\u201d for the company and that repealing it would be a \"negative.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding EV tax credits is nothing new to Tesla or legacy automakers. Gabelli Asset Management portfolio manager Brian Sponheimer told Yahoo Finance the topic has been a \"political football for quite some time,\" urging caution and a \"wait-and-see approach\" from investors.\n\nTrump, though, didn't sugarcoat his stance during his speech at the Republican National Convention. The former president told the crowd he would \"end the electric vehicle mandate on day one \u2014 thereby saving the US auto industry from complete obliteration, and saving US customers thousands of dollars per car.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf Elon thinks paying Trump $45 million a month will somehow stop Trump from destroying the EV tax credit, he's 100% wrong,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThe first thing they'll go after is all of the solar and EV tax credits. The government has a huge deficit and it's an easy thing to kill.\u201d\n\nMusk, though, isn\u2019t worried about a potential rollback in EV credits.\n\n\"Take away the subsidies,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"It will only help Tesla.\"\n\nMusk's support for Trump marks a shift from his past endorsements. In 2020, the billionaire said he voted for President Biden, and in 2016, he criticized Trump during his campaign against Hillary Clinton, saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\u201d\n\nRoughly thirty minutes after the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, Musk announced he was all in on the former president. In a post on X, Musk wrote, \u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\u201d\n\nSince then, Musk has used his megaphone on X to condemn Democrats and fuel narratives about the attempted assassination to his 190 million followers.\n\nTesla did not respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "While many investors are currently pessimistic regarding the electric vehicle (EV) industry, as sales growth continues to creep along rather than explode higher, Rivian(NASDAQ: RIVN) continues to buck the trend with positive news. Not only did it exceed expectations with second-quarter deliveries, it also inked a massive potential $5 billion deal with Volkswagen AG, helping drive the stock up 93% over the past three months.\n\nBetter yet, the most recent registration data shows that Rivian is outperforming its rivals. Here are the details and why it matters.\n\nWhat is registration data?\n\nRegistration data in the U.S. serves as a proxy for sales, and investors can use this information to glean insights that aren't found in monthly or quarterly sales data. Many automakers don't release this information, or don't break it down to individual vehicles. The downside is that this more insightful information is slower to reach investors and is delayed by a few weeks -- the most recent data, for example, is from May. But the insights are invaluable.\n\nWhat does the data show?\n\nWith the EV market saturated with high-priced EVs, consumer demand has slowed to a crawl until automakers can offer more affordable products. That's forced automakers into a tough position where they can choose to offer massive incentive deals, cut production, delay launches, let inventory stack up and lose value, or focus on comparable products such as hybrids.\n\nWe're seeing the choices automakers make in the May registration data, and the effects they're having on each automaker. The good news for Rivian investors is that its data is a large bright spot. Here are some examples.\n\nLet's start with opposite ends of the spectrum. On one hand, we have Kia, which posted an incredible 146% gain in new U.S. EV registrations in May. At first glance, those gains appear wonderful, but the issue with these gains is that Kia pushed massive incentives to move product. Its incentives on its EV6 and EV9 reached nearly $17,000 and topped $18,000 per vehicle, respectively.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, industry leader Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) opted to pump the brakes on incentives. It offered roughly $5,570 per vehicle in May, which caused its registrations to fall 15%. Tesla's share is still dominant at 46% of the segment, but significantly lower than the prior year's mark of 60%.\n\nRivian's bright spot\n\nWhile the trends from these examples are clear, more incentives mean more -- and less profitable -- sales and registrations, and a reduction in incentives means a loss of market share and sales. Rivian has managed to buck the trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsider that Rivian posted one of the strongest year-over-year gains at 87%, and that was done with only a modest $4,060 incentive on its R1T. But wait -- it gets even better.\n\n\"Whatever the brand is, you have to refresh your products or they're going to fade, and that's what's happening with Tesla now,\" said Tom Libby, associate director of industry analysis at S&P Global Mobility, according to Autonews.\n\nEarly in June, Rivian announced the introduction of the second generation of its flagship R1 vehicles. The R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck were reengineered with hundreds of hardware improvements, performance upgrades, a new software experience, and drive systems. The refresh included two entirely new premium Ascend trims, new Storm Blue paint, and blackout trim options. These premium trims typically generate higher margins for automakers.\n\nIs Rivian a buy?\n\nThe next year is likely to be a bumpy road for the EV industry, but Rivian investors should walk away impressed with the company's recent developments. Those developments include solid results on low incentives, a joint venture with Volkswagen, and the refresh of its R1 vehicles that could keep demand stable until its R2 crossover is launched in the first half of 2026 -- a vehicle that could help drive the company into a profitable future. Right now, Rivian looks like one of the better buys within the start-up EV industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "7 Lithium Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Crisis has become an opportunity for beaten-down lithium stocks.\n\nFor one, according to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), \u201cthe world urgently needs more lithium than it\u2019s producing today.\u201d\n\nTwo, we\u2019re just starting to see electric vehicle sales bounce back. In fact, according to Kelley Blue Book, about 330,460 EVs were sold in the U.S. just in the second quarter. With those numbers likely to increase even more, far more lithium will be needed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition, according to FastMarkets.com, we could see 487% growth in lithium demand to nearly 412,000 metric tons by 2030. Plus,\u00a0according to the\u00a0United Nation\u2019s Conference on Trade and Development, demand for metals, such as lithium are \u201con track\u201d to outpace production through 2050. The UN group also noted that \u201cLithium tops the list, with expected demand in 2045 more than tripling the likely supply in that year of nearly 1,400 metric tons.\u201d\n\nIn short, it\u2019s time to buy the excessive fear in lithium stocks before others wake up.\u00a0In fact, here are seven of the top lithium stocks you may want to buy on weakness today.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAt $93.81, the pullback in Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is overdone.\n\nNot expecting for it to stay this low for long, I\u2019d buy it here. While we wait for the eventual recovery, we can collect its 1.73% yield. Its new dividend of $0.405 is payable Oct. 1 to shareholders of record as of Sept. 13.\n\nGranted, most firms are negative on ALB with the pullback in lithium prices, but the drop truly has become overkill.\u00a0\u00a0And to be honest, their fear is our opportunity to buy.\u00a0Also, if the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates this year, as expected, it could drive electric vehicle sales, and related EV-related investments even higher, including lithium.\n\nHelping, recent earnings growth wasn\u2019t too shabby.\u00a0In its first quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents, which beat by a penny. Also, its total revenue did rise to $1.36 billion, which was better than the $1.29 billion forecast.\n\nSociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSociedad Quimica Y Minera (NYSE:SQM) is another one of the top lithium stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nWhile we also wait for SQM to recover, we can also collect its yield of about 5.09%.\n\nEarnings haven\u2019t been hot, but that\u2019s to be expected with current lithium prices. In its first quarter, its EPS loss of $3.04 missed by $1.46. Revenue, down 52.2% year over year, also missed by $60 million. However, it looks like the stock is priced in that weakness, as well as weakness from lithium prices. Plus, the company did raise its FY 2025 numbers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to\u00a0SQM Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Ramos:\u00a0\u201cWe believe that the strong demand growth in the lithium market seen since the beginning of the year could continue for the remainder of the year, with total lithium demand surpassing 1.1 million metric tons during 2024. Given this positive trend in demand growth, especially in\u00a0China\u00a0which accounts for almost 75% of global lithium demand, and our updated sales volumes outlook for the year, we believe that our sales volumes could reach 200,000 metric tons in 2024.\u201d\n\nArcadium Lithium (ALTM) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nArcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM) is also a buy on weakness.\n\nFor one, as a low-cost lithium producer, the company should see a massive acceleration in earnings growth with heavier demand for lithium. Two, analysts at RBC Capital just initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $4.\n\nIn fact, as noted by the firm, ALTM offers investors \u201cthe most vertically integrated, and diversified lithium and chemical exposure across our coverage.\u201d\n\nAlso, as noted by Investorplace contributor Muslim Farooque, \u201cIt\u2019s on course to realize roughly $60 to $80 million in synergies and cost reductions this year. Moreover, analysts forecast a healthy revenue increase of 34% to $1.19 billion this year and an even more staggering growth to $1.61 billion by 2025. Hence, ALTM is poised for significant growth.\u201d\n\nWhile ALTM won\u2019t make you rich overnight, patience will be rewarded.\n\nStandard Lithium (SLI) Standard Lithium logo or icon on website page, Illustrative Editorial\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nStandard Lithium (NYSEAMERICAN:SLI) has been a standout winner.\n\nRallying from about $1.20 to $1.45 on heavy volume, it\u2019s been one of the bright spots of a bleak lithium market. Things could get even better for the company, especially, with electric vehicle sales on the mend and the potential for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in September.\n\nHelping, there\u2019s a consensus strong buy on the SLI stock with a target of $3.97.\n\nBetter,\u00a0Standard Lithium recently announced its partnership with Equinor to develop its large-scale lithium projects in the Smackover Formation of east Texas and southwest Arkansas.\u00a0With this, the deeper pockets at Equinor could help de-risk current SLI projects and help reduce its capital expenditure obligations moving forward.\n\n\u201cWith this partnership, we have the opportunity to accelerate our progress and carve out a significant role in shaping the future of sustainably produced lithium,\u201d added Standard Lithium CEO Robert Mintak, as noted in a company press release.\n\nGlobal X Lithium ETF (LIT) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it. favorite Lithium stocks\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at exchange-traded funds (ETF) like the\u00a0Global X Lithium ETF(NYSEARCA:LIT).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.75%, the ETF invests in the complete lithium cycle. That includes mining and refining the metal through battery production.\n\nSome of its 40 holdings include Albemarle,\u00a0Pilbara Minerals (OTCMKTS:PILBF), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), Arcadium Lithium(NYSE:ALTM), and Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRHY).\n\nWe also have to consider that\u00a0should we see a stronger green energy boom and a global recovery in electric vehicle sales, lithium prices should explode even higher.\u00a0Plus, as noted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, lithium demand is\u00a0\u201con track\u201d to outpace production through 2050.\n\nAll of which could send lithium prices through the roof.\n\nAmplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) Energy Storage. battery stocks\n\nOr, we can jump into an ETF like the\u00a0Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:BATT) once it bottoms out again.\n\nAfter failing at $9.60 resistance, it\u2019s just starting to pivot lower again. Instead of trying to catch a falling knife here, it\u2019s best to wait until a new bottom is in place.\n\nLonger term, this is another hot ETF that could double, even triple, when lithium prices and related stocks start to push well off their lows. While simplistic to say, it\u2019s only a matter of time before lithium recovers and takes the BATT ETF along for the ride.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the BATT ETF provides exposure to global companies that develop, produce and use lithium battery technology \u2014 all for less than $10 a share. BATT ETF has 91 holdings, including\u00a0Tesla,\u00a0Albemarle\u00a0and Sociedad Quimica Y Minera.\n\nPiedmont Lithium (PLL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US mining company Piedmont Lithium Inc. (PLL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019d also wait to buy Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) on a pullback.\n\nAfter rallying from about $9, it\u2019s failing at $12.65 resistance. Instead of trying to catch the falling knife here, I\u2019d wait for it to bottom out first.\n\nLonger-term, there\u2019s a lot to like here, especially after the company\u00a0received approval for a permit for the construction and operation of its proposed Caroline Lithium project from North Carolina. Better, the company\u00a0says its mine could be one of North America\u2019s biggest sources of lithium for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nRoth MKM also reiterated a buy rating on Piedmont with a $65 price target shortly after it received approval for its mining permit from North Carolina.\n\nAgain, while I do expect to see further weakness immediate term, the stock has substantial upside opportunity with its projects over the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "Big Tech Stock Slump Amps Up Pressure to Deliver on Earnings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The stakes were already elevated for technology giants heading into this earnings season. They just got a lot higher after the worst week for the Nasdaq 100 Index in three months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nZuckerberg Calls Trump\u2019s Response to Shooting \u2018Badass\u2019 From ATMs to Flights, Epic IT Crash Leaves Trail of Chaos CrowdStrike\u2019s Global Outage Doesn\u2019t Have to Be a Recurring Nightmare Travel Chaos Mounts as Airlines Resume Flights After Outage How a Routine CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World\u2019s Computers\n\nAfter driving the rally in US stocks for most of the year, Big Tech slammed into a wall this week. Investors rotated from high-flying megacap shares to riskier, lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, the threat of more trade restrictions on chipmakers and concern that the hype around artificial intelligence may be overblown. AI darling Nvidia Corp. sank 8.8% this week, while Amazon.com Inc. dropped 5.8%.\n\nWith Wall Street projecting that the tech behemoths\u2019 profit growth is poised to slow, traders are plowing this year\u2019s winnings into cheaper areas \u2014 like small-capitalization stocks caps that stand to benefit from lower borrowing costs, and sectors like health care, where earnings are expected to perk up. It\u2019s all heightening the focus on next week, when major tech companies start reporting quarterly results.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of reasons to think tech will be less friendly over the coming year,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cAt these levels, everything has to go right.\u201d\n\nHeading into the key stretch of announcements, the Nasdaq 100 is up 16% this year after this week\u2019s 4% tumble, its steepest since April. The S&P 500 Index is up about 15% in 2024, with much of the advance generated by the largest tech stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. kicks off earnings for the cohort Tuesday, along with Tesla Inc. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. are due the following week. The entire group has benefited from AI-fueled optimism and investors will want some reassurance that the technology will move the needle for profit and revenue gains.\n\nAn \u201cepic\u201d reversal from Big Tech will continue unless the companies can convince analysts to raise their sales estimates for the second half of the year and 2025, Goldman Sachs strategists including David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf these companies can\u2019t generate meaningful profits and revenue from AI, and you remove the impact of that idea, then the stocks go back to where they were a year ago,\u201d said Samana at Wells Fargo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe five biggest US technology companies \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 are facing tough comparisons with the stellar earnings cycles of the past year. Profits for the group are projected to rise 29% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n\nWhile still strong, that\u2019s down from the past three quarters, when growth for the group ranged from 44% to 49%. The overall message from Wall Street: Expect results to show the companies are still booming, but not to the extent seen last year.\n\nGoogle, Tesla\n\nThere are other themes investors will be drilling down into starting next week.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet, for example, will give a glimpse into the health of the digital advertising market. The search giant is projected to deliver profit of around $23 billion on revenue of $70.7 billion in the second quarter, up 25% and 14%, respectively, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnd with electric-vehicle demand mired in a slump, money managers will be keenly interested in Tesla\u2019s announcement. The carmaker\u2019s profit is projected to shrink 37% in the second quarter to $1.7 billion, while sales are expected to decline 1% to $24.6 billion.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t dampened the mood for the stock, which is up almost 70% from an April low. Tesla investors are pinning their hopes on Elon Musk\u2019s promised robotaxi service. After the company postponed an event initially scheduled for next month, investors will be looking for details on Tesla\u2019s earnings call about progress on the self-driving car initiative.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc., the cybersecurity company responsible for a global IT outage on Friday, isn\u2019t expected to report earnings until late next month.\n\nWay Up\n\nDespite the latest declines, stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are still sitting on big gains. Nvidia, which is expected to report late next month, has more than doubled this year while Facebook\u2019s owner has advanced more than a third. As a result, valuations for many remain stretched. Nvidia is priced at 37 times projected profits for the next 12 months, while Microsoft and Apple both trade at more than 31 times.\n\nThe average valuation for the S&P 500 is 21 times. The benchmark for small-cap shares, the Russell 2000 Index, trades at about 26 times estimated profits.\n\nThe tech sector is the only segment where valuations are above historical averages and analysts have still been revising estimates higher, according to Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. That\u2019s created a situation where misses are likely to be punished, she said.\n\n\u201cA miss in tech is to be classified as an unforgivable sin in the market right now because expectations are so high,\u201d she said.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "3 Overvalued Stocks Teetering on the Brink of Collapse",
        "content": "Overvalued stocks typically trade at a price higher than their intrinsic value due to factors like high growth. However, they can be more volatile if their prices are driven by market speculation and investor sentiment rather than fundamentals. Selling such stocks on time mitigates the risks of price corrections, lost future returns, increased volatility and missed opportunities elsewhere. This is especially relevant now with markets on the downside.\n\nWhen evaluating for overvaluation, it is important to analyze key metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and others, as well as look for profitability loss or some negative news. In addition, the relative strength index (RSI) may be reviewed to identify overbought conditions.\n\nTo find suitable overvalued stocks that are teetering on the blink of a minor or major collapse due to speculation, we looked for stocks with negative EPS and at least a 15% increase in their share prices over the past few months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s examine three stocks that exhibit metrics outside of normal and meet some of these requirements.\n\nFidelity National Information Services (FIS) Close up of FIS ground sign in Tampa, Fl, USA. Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) is an American company which offers a wide range of financial products.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions for merchants, banks and capital markets firms worldwide. It operates in three main business segments. Merchants represent 3% of its revenue, Banking 68% and Capital Market Solutions 29%. FIS aims to realize further synergies from its acquisitions, but the impact has been mixed.\n\nA reduction in interest rates could benefit the company\u2019s coverage ratio and reduce its high debt of $11.28 billion. However, it could further compress margins for the Banking Solution segment. A reduction in the Federal funds rate is not to be expected before September.\n\nNotably, in its last quarterly earnings report, FIS reported EPS growth of 431.51% and revenue growth of 5.78%. The main contributor was its biggest revenue generator, Banking. Capital Markets experienced an 80 basis point contraction in EBITDA margin.\n\nYet, the company reported an annual loss for fiscal year 2023 of -$11.26 per share. With a net profit margin of -61.37% and trading 30% higher year-to-date (YTD), investors should be alarmed.\n\nAs a software company, FIS stock trades at a high P/E ratio of 106.32x. The industry average is 27.6x, making FIS one of the overvalued stocks to sell. The average analyst price target of $80.83 has also been nearly achieved, leaving little room and time to adjust positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nTESLA (TSLA) The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures and sells electric vehicles (EVs), battery storage, solar panels and solar roof tiles. It aims to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. However, competition in the EV market intensifies as traditional automakers ramp up EV production and new entrants gain traction.\n\nSupply chain issues have led to production delays and higher costs for the company. Regulatory investigations into Autopilot and claims of full self-driving continue to loom over Tesla. And Elon Musk\u2019s controversial behavior and poor corporate political disclosure raise concerns for Tesla\u2019s brand favorability.\r\n\r\nBesides these factors, Tesla\u2019s most recent financial results indicate cause for concern. Revenue growth slowed by 9.27% in the first quarter, coming in below analyst expectations. Due to increased costs, gross profit margins declined to 19.3%, while EPS decreased by 53.79% from the prior quarter.\n\nWith Tesla set to report earnings next week, risks of another earnings miss are real as TSLA stock has traded up over 60% in the past three months. With guidance indicating ongoing margin pressure and the RSI into overbought territory, Tesla may be one of the overvalued stocks to sell.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront. Peloton layoffs\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeloton Interactive (NYSE:PTON) provides connected fitness products, including bikes, treadmills and subscriptions, for live and on-demand workout classes. The company has faced several challenges, including product recalls, supply chain disruptions and negative publicity related to safety concerns.\n\nWhile PTON continues developing innovative fitness solutions, investors may want to consider it as one of the overvalued stocks based on its financial performance and broader economic factors like inflation.\n\nPeloton Interactive\u2019s 2023 annual revenue declined 21.3% to $2.8 billion from $3.75 billion, with quarterly down 4.17%. Despite an improving gross margin, the company reported a net loss of $167.3 million and -$1.26 billion for the full year. This continued trend of net losses reflects ongoing profitability challenges.\n\nDespite consecutive losses and negative earnings, PTON stock has risen around 25% in the past three months. Forward valuation metrics, such as forward EV/FCF of 826.37 and forward EV/EBITDA of 31.47, suggest that the market expects a substantial improvement in Peloton\u2019s performance. However, given the company\u2019s recent track record, these expectations may be overly optimistic. PTON is one of the overvalued stocks that may be considered for sale.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Cathie Wood Stocks That Could Heat up Once Interest Rates Dip",
        "content": "As investors look forward to rate cuts in the second half and going into 2025, perhaps those riskier high-multiple technology companies, such as Cathie Wood stocks, that don\u2019t stand to make huge profits until way into the future (if at all) will have their moment in the sun again.\n\nUndoubtedly, Cathie Wood and the Ark Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) have struggled to keep pace with the Nasdaq 100 in recent years. As rates and inflation fall (Cathie Wood sees deflation ahead), the climate certainly seems a heck of a lot more hospitable to speculative innovators that have been long forgotten in this large-cap-favored era of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nOnly time will tell if lower rates cause the Ark funds to get going again. At this juncture, I think it\u2019s unrealistic to expect 2020 lows in interest rates to return. That\u2019s unless deflation is in the cards for the economy, as Wood believes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three of my favorite Cathie Wood stocks for investors looking to pick and choose their own disruptive innovators to take advantage of lower rates.\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nCathie Wood may not be as bullish on the Magnificent Seven heavyweights as most other big-name money managers out there. However, she does have a huge position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock for the flagship ARKK ETF.\n\nThrough the past two years of excess volatility, Wood has stood by Elon Musk and the top EV firm, at least for the most part. Of course, Wood sold some Tesla stock earlier this year, but the ETF remains very much overweight in the name.\n\nAs interest rates fall, perhaps Tesla won\u2019t be as sensitive to inevitable drops in vehicle deliveries. For the most part, deliveries are the only thing that matters for investors who follow Tesla quarter to quarter.\n\nThat said, the longer-term growth story encompasses growth from AI, robotaxis, humanoid robots (Optimus), and energy storage. These projects do not come cheap, so any drop in borrowing costs should be viewed as a major plus.\n\nAt 63.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), TSLA stock looks fully valued after barely falling from its sharp June-July spike.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) stock is another lagging holding within the ARKK ETF. Shares of the interactive gaming platform firm are down around 7% year to date, all while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 surged by double digits.\n\nWith a growing number of brands advertising on Roblox, perhaps investors looking to play an early-form metaverse should punch their ticket into RBLX stock while it\u2019s still down significantly from its all-time highs. Arguably, firms seeking to better resonate with younger consumers should be looking to explore new frontiers, like in Roblox, to market their products.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, e.l.f. Beauty (NASDAQ:ELF) doubled down on its collaboration with Roblox to allow users to buy cosmetics via Roblox. Indeed, it seems strange to be buying makeup through a video game. Either way, I think the move will be a hit among young players. Perhaps transacting on Roblox could be a hint of what the future of the metaverse holds for marketers.\n\nUipath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Uipath (NASDAQ:PATH), one of the lesser-known Ark holdings, but one that deserves the attention of growth investors seeking AI-driven growth at a reasonable price. Like many other Cathie Wood stocks, PATH shares have been on an abysmal run in the past few years.\n\nPATH stock is still down over 84% from its peak, just shy of $80 per share, which hit all the way back in May 2021.\n\nGiven how things have been going, it looks like shares of the process automation software developer probably won\u2019t be making new highs anytime this decade. The company recently announced it\u2019s laying off 10% of staff (around 420 positions).\n\nIn any case, the $7.2 billion mid-cap Cathie Woodstock looks incredibly cheap at 5.3 times price-to-sales (P/S). With co-founder Daniel Dines re-appointed as CEO, it will be interesting to see how the firm can return on the right path.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "What Trump-Vance could mean for Wall Street",
        "content": "The signals from Donald Trump and his party at the GOP convention this week painted a mixed picture of what posture the former president would have toward Wall Street and the larger business world if he returns to Washington.\n\nOn one front, the GOP and Trump are embracing a growing strain of economic populism.\n\nTrump, for example, invited a union leader to speak on Monday night \u2014 unheard of at previous GOP conventions. He also hand-picked as his running mate Sen. JD Vance, whose ascent is built on a stance that differs from traditional GOP orthodoxy on key economic topics like corporate taxes and breaking up Big Tech.\n\nBut plenty of other signals this week highlighted more of a business-friendly Trump approach to these topics. They marked the continuation of a trend that runs through Trump's nine years in presidential politics as he has alternatively wooed and slammed CEOs. Former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump alongside his family after he accepted his party's nomination in Milwaukee on July 18. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nTrump, for example, didn't repeat Vance's populist tone when he took the stage Thursday night and instead took time to focus on an issue popular in C-suites: lowering corporate taxes.\n\nHe extolled the 2017 corporate cuts he signed into law and said they had brought businesses back to America.\n\n\"We gave you the largest tax cut. We'll do it more,\" Trump said in a tax message to both voters and executives.\n\nTrump also mused about appointing JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon \u2014 Wall Street's biggest name \u2014 as Treasury secretary in an interview with Bloomberg that was conducted weeks ago but released this week.\n\nA source familiar with Dimon's thinking told Yahoo Finance in response to such musings that \"it's highly unlikely that [Dimon] will take a political role\" and that he'll be instead focused on running his bank, the largest in the US.\n\n'We'll manage just fine'\n\nAt the moment, Trump is courting the business community intensely.\n\nHe has gained financial backing from Wall Street figures like Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman and tech titans like Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Musk reportedly could be set to give a whopping $180 million to a Trump-aligned super-PAC before this election season is out.\n\nThose business world donors appear happy to keep giving, and conversations this week with close observers of how Trump could approach policy in 2025 evinced little worry that the populist posture often seen on stage in Milwaukee will translate into anti-business policies.\n\n\"Red, Blue, we'll manage just fine,\" Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said in a Yahoo Finance live appearance Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nGray is a Democratic donor and gave over $50,000 to President Joe Biden's effort but added Thursday \"if there is a movement here towards the Republican side, I'm confident we'll navigate that.\" Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman during the Business Roundtable Summit in Washington in 2018. (JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) (JIM WATSON via Getty Images)\n\nChris Whalen, a strategist and chair of Whalen Global Advisors, was more blunt in a note to Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The banking & mortgage industries will be treated well under Trump,\" he wrote, adding that some questions remain, like how the government treats government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But many parameters of how a new Trump administration would approach the financial sector are set.\n\nIn closed-door fundraisers and before CEOs in recent months, the billionaire Trump has also often espoused his proposal to cut corporate taxes.\n\nCurrently, the federal corporate tax rate is 21%. Trump wants it lower and has floated a 20% or a 15% rate. Those figures are largely because, as he has said, he's a fan of round numbers.\n\nIn his discussion of corporate taxes Thursday from the convention stage, Trump said of the cut he enacted in 2017 that companies \"were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country ... the tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them.\"\n\nA GOP focus on populism in the years ahead\n\nThese dueling messages were present all week in Milwaukee.\n\nTrump invited the president of the Teamsters union, Sean O'Brien, to address the convention Monday. The Republican candidate was in the room for the speech and looked on approvingly as O'Brien assailed traditional GOP economic policies and added that \"the corporate elite treat us like squatters.\"\n\nVance followed up by announcing Wednesday night \"we're done, ladies and gentlemen, catering to Wall Street\" while calling top financial leaders \"barons.\"\n\nVance also has a concrete record that has overlapped with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren on a range of banking issues.\n\nThe two have been aligned on clawing back the pay of failed bank executives and both share concerns about a decision by regulators to sell the operations of the failed First Republic bank to JPMorgan instead of a smaller regional lender.\n\nBut on the other hand, Vance also has sizable venture capital and Silicon Valley connections and lived in San Francisco to work in the industry for GOP megadonor Peter Thiel. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to JD Vance, his new running mate, during the 2024 Republican National Convention. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nVance also appears to be shifting on some issues. One is a bill that targets Visa and Mastercard. Vance had bucked much of his party and co-sponsored an effort around swipe fees but, according to a recent Politico report, is now not planning to push the bill.\n\nVance also aligns with Republicans by being skeptical of stricter capital requirements on banks. Those proposed reforms, known as Basel III Endgame, were meant to ensure the stability of the banking system but are expected to undergo significant revisions amid bipartisan criticism this year.\n\nIn a note this week, Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner advised clients to look at Vance as a symbol of a longer-term shift in the Republican Party.\n\n\"Reagan Republicans are a dying breed, will have waning influence going forward, and Vance's rise is part of that shift,\" he wrote.\n\nIn any case, Vance and Trump symbolize a series of crosscurrents likely to be closely watched in the financial world for months to come.\n\n\"JD, you're going to be doing this for a long time, so enjoy the ride,\" Trump said Thursday of his running mate.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Will Tesla's Cybertruck define its future?",
        "content": "Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Cybertruck is divisive.\n\nThe electric truck received nearly 2 million preorders before its 2019 release, but the hype has cooled off in some corners of the market. That\u2019s partly due to its higher-than-expected price tag, recalls leading to safety concerns, and its design.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a really ugly look. Ugly is interesting.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Shark Tank investor and entrepreneur Kevin O\u2019Leary described the car to Yahoo Finance in May 2023. O'Leary has invested in companies providing the technology behind the truck.\n\nAs of mid-June, Tesla was producing 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a goal of reaching 2,500 weekly vehicles by the end of 2024. With a price tag reaching almost $100,000 for the top-of-the-line model \u2014 the Cyberbeast \u2014 the truck is more expensive than the roughly $50,000 price investors were anticipating.\n\nWill the Cybertruck become Tesla's next big hit, as pervasive as the Model 3, or will it be a miss for the EV company? Here are a few things to consider when evaluating the potential impact of the Cybertruck on Tesla\u2019s financial future. In this Nov. 21, 2019 file photo, Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, Calif. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBulletproof. Stainless steel skin. A steering wheel that feels electric. These are all features that are unique to the Cybertruck, the first vehicle in the US to use a full steer-by-wire system.\n\nSteer-by-wire differs from typical pickup trucks in that it uses electronics to steer rather than having a steering rack that connects the wheel with the tires. It's considered to be a more energy-efficient system.\n\nWhile the bulletproof exoskeleton of the car is a draw for some consumers, for others, it\u2019s a nonstarter.\n\n\u201cThe Cybertruck is way out there \u2026 harkening to this sort of Blade Runner-esque, dystopian sort of looking, kind of hard edges stainless steel,\u201d according to Pras Subramanian, Yahoo Finance\u2019s senior automotive reporter.\n\nThe car's aesthetic could be here to stay. Walter Isaacson, who wrote a biography of Musk, has seen preliminary sketches of the much-anticipated (and delayed) robotaxi and said it looks like the Cybertruck.\n\nIn terms of demand, the Cybertruck could be a key differentiator in an increasingly competitive EV market.\n\nTesla\u2019s share of US EV sales fell below 50% for the first time ever in the second quarter. At the same time, the Cybertruck was the highest-selling EV pickup truck in the US in the month of May, according to S&P Global.\n\nWhile Tesla hasn\u2019t revealed how much it costs to build the Cybertruck, the vehicle was first built at the company\u2019s new Texas Gigafactory, which Musk said was a $10 billion investment.\n\nAnd the process of building the truck is not easy. The unique exoskeleton is formed using a technique called air bending, which uses high air pressure to shape the stainless steel.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s goal is to get the price tag near $50,000, but these manufacturing costs could make that difficult to achieve.\n\nWhat's the verdict? Despite mixed reviews, loyal Tesla fans may continue to support Musk\u2019s product visions \u2014 and Tesla's stock price.\n\nTesla\u2019s short sellers have lost over $60 billion since the company went public, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners.\n\nUltimately, company fundamentals, such as sales numbers for the Cybertruck, are not always what drives Tesla's stock performance.\n\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s what the market is doing rather than exactly what Tesla is doing,\u201d Dusaniwsky said.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Mag 7 Earnings: 2 Reports Coming This Week",
        "content": "Earnings season is in full swing, with a notably stacked reporting docket for the week. The expectation is for another period of positive growth, underpinned by strength within tech.\n\nAnd concerning the notable releases next week, two Mag 7 members, Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA are on the reporting docket. But how do expectations stack up heading into each respective release? Let\u2019s take a closer look at estimates and a few key metrics.\n\nCan Alphabet Shares Soar Again?\n\nMega-cap titan Alphabet will reveal its quarterly results next Tuesday on July 23rd after the market\u2019s close. Recent quarterly prints have been favorable for the company, with it exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 11% across its last four releases.\n\nShares enjoying bullish activity following its latest print, sparking a rally. The company has enjoyed a nice growth phase, with earnings and revenue from the release climbing 61% and 15% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nAnalysts have taken a favorable stance on the company\u2019s outlook for the quarter to be reported, with the $1.85 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up nearly 6% since mid-April. The value reflects a 28% change from the year-ago period, continuing its recent growth trajectory. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud and AI optimism fueled shares following its latest release, with investors likely to be laser-focused on the same topics again. The company\u2019s Cloud results have recently exceeded our expectations in back-to-back releases, easing prior fears of an overall slowdown in the space. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares aren\u2019t expensive heading into the release despite the strong share performance, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting beneath the 22.4X five-year median. And the current PEG ratio works out to be 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nThe stock sports a Style Score of \u2018C\u2019 for Value.\n\nTesla Margins are Key\n\nShares popped following the release of Tesla\u2019s delivery/production data. The EV leader's Q2 deliveries reached 444k, and EVs produced totaled 411k. The results pleased investors, though it\u2019s worth noting that deliveries were down a modest 4.1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nMargins will undoubtedly be in focus for the company\u2019s quarterly release, which is expected on next Tuesday, July 23rd. Recent margin pressures have been a focus among investors, helping explain the stock\u2019s slow start to 2024.\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings expectations are overall down since the end of April, but positive revisions did hit the tape just recently near the beginning of July, a favorable development leading into the release. The $0.62 per share expected suggests a 14% climb from the year-ago period, getting the EV titan back into positive territory. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite a slow start to the year, Tesla shares have gained a remarkable 70% just over the last three months, showing notable outperformance and bullish sentiment. A favorable quarterly release could easily keep shares melting higher, particularly if the company speaks favorably about margins.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with many notable companies scheduled to report, including the two Mag 7 members Alphabet GOOGL and Tesla TSLA.\n\nConcerning Alphabet, investors will be looking for further color on the cloud computing / AI environment, whereas Tesla investors will be zeroed in on margins and future plans surrounding autonomous driving.\n\nBoth companies report after the market\u2019s close on July 23rd.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Many in the market are looking to the two members of \u2018the Magnificent 7\u2019 who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market\u2019s recent weakness.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks\u2019 impressive runs already.\n\nThe chart below shows the performance of the Mag 7 stocks since the start of July relative to the S&P 500 index. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, Tesla TSLA is in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft MSFT (down -2.3%) and Alphabet GOOGL (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\n\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon AMZN, Meta META, and Nvidia NVDA at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market\u2019s close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\n\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla\u2019s Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\n\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla\u2019s Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\n\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn\u2019t always the most important factor behind the stock\u2019s post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company\u2019s cloud results and AI outlook.\n\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company\u2019s performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\n\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q2 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs with the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week\u2019s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index\u2019s membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week\u2019s line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 71 companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\n\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\n\nYou can see in the chart below that the $515.5 billion in aggregate S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are above the $512.3 billion earned by the index in 2023 Q3. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "content": "Trump-Vance Administration Will Be 'Terrible' For Tesla, Says Bear: Elon Musk 'Has Completely Alienated Most Of His Buying Base'\n\nA Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) bear on Wednesday said a second term for Republican nominee Donald Trump is a negative for CEO Elon Muskand his electric-vehicle giant.\n\nTerrible For Tesla: Musk has been subject to several Department of Justice investigations, said Stanphyl Capital Managing Member Mark Spiegel. \u201cThere are.... several at least fraudulent things he's done in plain sight,\u201d he said, adding that the billionaire is having trouble with the DOJ.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nThe portfolio manager also said a Trump second term will likely be a negative for Tesla. \u201cIt is unquestionable that a Trump-Vance administration is terrible for Tesla from a business standpoint,\u201d he said.\n\nSpiegel noted that Trump has said time and again that he would get rid of all the EV mandates and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. This meant that Tesla wouldn\u2019t have the margin anymore, he said. If Tesla might get $3,000 in a car and if the $7,500 EV tax credit is eliminated it may have to raise prices, which in turn will weigh down on demand, he added.\n\nAbout 70% of the buyer base of EVs are Democrats, and with now Musk outrightly endorsing Trump and contributing to the Republican campaign, only very few Democrats would be willing to buy a Tesla at this point, Spiegel said. Musk has \u201ccompletely alienated most of his buying base,\u201d he said, adding that the situation was the same in Europe. The Democratic-equivalent in Europe, the liberal progressives, won\u2019t buy Tesla either, he said.\n\nTrending:Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.\n\nSpiegel also sees Trump doing away with the EV mandates, which means auto manufacturers will not be forced to sell a certain amount of EVs to avoid penalties. \u201cIf OEMS don't have to jam electric cars down people's throats OK, so Tesla can have more market share but it's going to be a shrinking market especially if they have alienated 70% of their user base and then their cars plus $7500 more so, it's that many fewer buyers.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory credits, which have a 100% gross margin, may not flow into Tesla if the EV mandates are eliminated, he said.\n\nSee Also: Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100\n\nWhy It\u2019s Important: Tesla has been through a prolonged fundamental lean patch during when the macro uncertainties and slowing EV adoption hurt demand. Price cuts, the strategy adopted by the company to sidestep the headwinds served to erode its margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncidentally, Musk recently lauded Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), whom Trump picked as his running mate despite the senator\u2019s anti-EV stance. Pursuant to that the billionaire said taking away subsidies is going to only help Tesla. The Tesla CEO echoed the sentiment relayed by Wedbush Daniel Ives in a note last week. \u201cA Trump presidency would be an overall negative for the EV industry as likely the EV rebates/tax incentives get pulled, however for Tesla we see this as a potential positive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment,\u201d the bullish analyst said.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCan you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027?

Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJer\u00f3nimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestl\u00e9 (NESNE.SW)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "America\u2019s largest economy is falling out of love with Tesla\u2014and it\u2019s only going to get worse",
        "content": "This might be the end of a love affair that became unrequited. Elon Musk has been steadfast in bashing California and has pledged to move Tesla, SpaceX, and X to Texas. Californians, in turn, are turning their backs on Musk.\n\nTeslasales in California dropped 24.1 % in the second quarter, the brand\u2019s third straight quarterly decline in the state. Purchases dipped 7.8% in the first quarter of 2024 and 9.8% in the final quarter of last year. Year-to-date, Tesla sales in California are down 17% compared to last year, according to the latest analysis of new vehicle registrations published by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). Instead of a Tesla from Musk\u2019s $793 billion electric vehicle empire, California car buyers are purchasing battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) from Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford. The analysis found Toyota BEV registrations have soared 108.1% so far this year, while Hyundai and Ford BEV registrations rose 65.7% and 26.4%, respectively.\n\nPlenty of factors are at play in Tesla\u2019s sales decline, Brian Maas, president of the CNCDA, told Fortune. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are substantially the same vehicles they were five years ago, and buyers interested in those cars might represent a finite share of the market\u2014and they might already own a Tesla. Without new models to entice customers, buyers look elsewhere for new cars, he said. And while Tesla has dominated the EV market, the past several years have seen competitors creep in and erode the company\u2019s share with lower costs, newer cars, and greater variety, he explained. Accordingly, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is now the third best-selling EV in California this year, wresting control of third place from the Tesla Model X, the CNCDA analysis found.\n\nAnd while the data is based only on registrations in California, branding could work against Musk. About 46.9% of registered voters in California are Democrats, while 23.9% of registered voters are Republicans. According to reputational management firm Caliber, more Republicans trust and like Musk than Democrats. Critically, however, more Democrats are willing to buy Teslas, which could be because Democrats are more likely to prioritize buying an electric vehicle over a gas-powered car, Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz told Fortune\u2019s Eva Roytburg.\n\nNow, staunchly Blue California has learned about Musk\u2019s reported $45 million a month donation to a pro-Trump Super PAC and his endorsement of the former president and Republican Party nominee. This might not bode well for already declining sales, and the Hyundai Ioniq\u2019s rising popularity could be the first blush of a blue backlash.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s a shift in the brand, that\u2019s always going to have an impact on consumer behavior,\u201d said Maas.\n\nTo be sure, Tesla is still the car of choice in California. The top-selling car is the Tesla Model Y in the new-vehicle market of BEVs and plug-in hybrids. The second top-selling BEV and plug-in model is the Model 3. Yet, California has embraced BEVs in droves, while other car buyers haven\u2019t been as enthusiastic. According to Experian, California\u2019s BEV market share is 21.4%, while the overall U.S. market share of BEVs is 7.5%.\n\nWithout detailed research, it\u2019s difficult to connect Musk\u2019s political views with buying trends, in Maas\u2019 view. It\u2019s more likely that Tesla sales are sluggish because the cars haven\u2019t been revised or refreshed in years and people invest in durability, features, safety, and affordability\u2014not a CEO\u2019s mindset.\n\n\u201cMr. Musk\u2019s political views could change tomorrow,\u201d said Maas. \u201cThat being said, I assume the effect is not zero.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s continued gripes with California, where more than one in five new cars sold are electric, is losing him customers to Rivian.\n\nIndustry data on Thursday revealed demand for new Teslas in the Golden State plummeted 24% to 52,211 vehicles in Q2, based on registrations recorded post-sale when a vehicle\u2019s title is processed.\n\nThe latest figures mark Tesla\u2019s third consecutive three-month period of declines compared to the previous year, suggesting that the volume of its existing range may have peaked in 2023 when it hit 230,500 vehicles.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s allure seems to be wearing off,\u201d said the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), which published the figures it sources from Experian Automotive.\n\nMeanwhile, registrations of its Rivian soared 69% this quarter to 3,742 vehicles, making it the fastest-growing major brand in California.\n\nThe Rivian R1S crossover has climbed one spot to become the third best-selling non-Tesla EV behind only the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach-E.\n\nOne well-known Tesla owner from Malibu who frequently uploads videos of Full-Self Driving beta tests to social media under her avatar @MissJilliane, posted on Tuesday after Musk publicly endorsed Trump that she, too, was thinking of\u00a0ditching her Tesla for a Rivian.\n\nGood Morning!! \ud83c\udf1e pic.twitter.com/ozYY715SDA\n\n\u2014 Miss Jilianne (@MissJilianne) July 16, 2024\n\nEVs are hot in California\n\nCalifornia is crucial for Tesla\u2019s business since the EV share of the state's new car market at 21.4% is nearly three times the U.S. average of 7.5% in 2023.\n\nOf the nearly 381,000 electric vehicles sold in the state that year across all car brands, six out of ten were Tesla cars.\n\nEven when conventional combustion vehicles are included in the mix, the Model 3 was California\u2019s best-selling passenger car in 2023, surpassing the Toyota Camry, while the Model Y proved the state\u2019s most popular vehicle of any kind.\n\nThe brand even briefly eclipsed Toyota as the number one choice for buyers in the state when Tesla sales nearly hit 69,000 cars in the second quarter of last year.\n\nTo be clear, Tesla still dominates the state\u2019s EV market with a 53% market share in the first half of 2024.\n\nThat means all other competitors combined still sell fewer EVs than Musk.\n\nRivian had a share of just 3.6%, by comparison.\n\nYet that also means California is Tesla\u2019s market to lose, and Musk does not appear to be doing his company any favors by constantly agitating against left-leaning issues popular among many of his mainly progressive customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter formally endorsing Trump on Sunday, the entrepreneur then followed up with news on Tuesday he was moving the headquarters of both SpaceX and X Corp to Texas.\n\nHe cited a controversial new state law called AB1955 that prohibits teachers from discussing children\u2019s sexual identity with their parents\u2014for Musk \u201cthe final straw\u201d.\n\nThis is the final straw.\n\nBecause of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas. https://t.co/cpWUDgBWFe\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 16, 2024\n\nHe had already voiced his displeasure with Sacramento when he moved the headquarters of Tesla three years ago during the pandemic.\n\nThe demanding CEO had repeatedly clashed with county health officials over the operation of his Fremont vehicle factory, the largest in North America, which produced some 560,00 cars last year.\n\nMusk has won over many new conservative converts to his social media business, which rebranded last year to eliminate any association it still had with legacy Twitter.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t help him when it comes to Tesla, since the new cohort he recruited to boost advertising-relevant traffic on his X platform typically takes a very dim view of the environmentally friendly EVs predominantly preferred by voters on the left.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "The S&P 500 has been making new all-time highs on seemingly a weekly basis. And while recent price action in the market has been relatively weak, optimism appears to remain plentiful. Various meme stocks have ridden this sentiment higher during certain bouts of euphoria this year. Yet, many of the top names in the more speculative corners of the market are down considerably from this year\u2019s peak.\n\nThe question is whether meme stocks as a whole can regain their luster, or if a select few will see the majority of the upside if this bull market continues. I think the latter scenario is much more likely, with most meme stocks not worth your time of day.\n\nFor investors looking for some high-profile meme stocks with an actual shot at providing meaningful gains, explore my top three picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has surged 69% so far in 2024 due to surging artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. Indeed, the public ultimately recognized that Palantir is a big data and AI company that\u2019s worth its high valuation.\n\nThe company has seen impressive growth in its commercial segment, which drove the majority of the company\u2019s revenue and earnings beat. Adoption for the company\u2019s AI products is picking up from various blue-chip clients, who appear to be well-positioned to remain customers for the long-term.\n\nAlso, the firm\u2019s core government business saw revenue grow 16%, with notable contracts like a $178 million deal secured with the U.S. Army. International government revenue increased by 33%, highlighting the company\u2019s global expansion, despite European challenges. Palantir Technologies is poised for market dominance by 2030.\n\nThe company\u2019s versatility, from optimizing hospital systems to developing Army technology, presents a vast market opportunity. This bodes well for long-term investors, suggesting substantial opportunities for long-term growth.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nAs the King of the AI chip sector, semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has surged more than 150% in 2024 alone. That return isn\u2019t surprising, considering Nvidia\u2019s GPUs power almost the entire AI ecosystem right now.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q2 earnings are going to be significant for investors in determining whether the recent high demand for its chips is sustainable. Market optimism about a Fed pivot could benefit Nvidia if businesses align with this view.\n\nDespite concerns about potential overvaluation and a correction, the company remains optimistic about its long-term performance. A key factor is its accelerated chip development, with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang announcing annual AI chip launches instead of every two years. In the last quarter, Nvidia reported $26 billion in revenue, a 262% increase year-over-year (YOY), with a projected 2% rise next quarter. While trading at a premium, its growth potential justifies the current multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies across sectors are racing to develop AI applications, relying on Nvidia\u2019s hardware. Although valuations were high, Nvidia has consistently aced its revenue and earnings estimates, making the upcoming report crucial for analysts.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLastly, despite its tremendous downside seen over the past couple of months, EV king Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still a prominent artificial intelligence (AI) stock to consider. As of this writing, Tesla has revealed its Tesla bot, which they debuted in the 2024 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai. Analysts suggest this prototype could soon replace human labor in various industries.\n\nI\u2019ve been bearish on Tesla in the past, and am still broadly bearish on this company over the long-term. But I\u2019m not going to deny the fact that this is a company with a meme or cult following. CEO Elon Musk is among the most divisive figures in big tech, but he\u2019s someone investors continue to follow. So long as that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s hard to bet against this name if meme mania returns.\n\nDespite reporting an 8.7% revenue decline and a 55.1% drop in earnings, Tesla maintained a profit margin of 14.37% and an operating margin of 5.50%. Investors remained bullish, with TSLA stock now up over 50% in a month, driven by excitement over Robotaxi concepts. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised its price target on TSLA stock in part due to growth in the company\u2019s energy segment. It noted a record 9.4 GWh of energy storage deployed in Q2 of 2024, despite Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries miss.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tesla TSLA is slated to release\u00a0second-quarter 2024 results\u00a0on Jul 23, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings and revenues is pegged at 62 cents per share and $25.1 billion, respectively.\n\nThe earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised upward by 2 cents over the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection, however, indicates a year-over-year decline of 32%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a modest year-over-year increase of 0.8%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA\u2019s revenues is pegged at $98 billion, implying a rise of 1.7% year over year. The consensus mark for 2024 EPS is pegged at $2.48, implying a contraction of around 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIn the trailing four quarters, this electric vehicle (EV) behemoth surpassed EPS estimates just once and missed on the other occasions, with the average negative earnings surprise being -1.55%.\n\nTesla, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tesla, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers for Q2\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla. The combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That\u2019s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nTSLA has an Earnings ESP of -4.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping TSLA\u2019s Q2 Results\n\nTesla produced 410,831 vehicles (386,576 Model 3/Y and 24,255 Model S/X) in the three months ended June. It delivered 443,956 cars (422,405 Model 3/Y and 21,551 other models) worldwide in the second quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 469,599 vehicles. The reported deliveries were down roughly 5% year over year but increased 15% from the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA\u2019s second-quarter revenues from automotive sales is pegged at $20.6 billion, implying an uptick from $20.4 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Tesla resorted to price cuts and incentives to spur vehicle sales. While that might have helped stimulate demand in the second quarter, it is also likely to cause margin compression. The consensus mark for gross profit from the automotive unit is $3.75 billion, implying a 23.4% decline from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nWhile automotive profits are expected to contract on a yearly basis in the quarter to be reported, Tesla has been benefiting from increasing energy generation and storage revenues, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Energy Generation/Storage segment is pegged at $2.32 billion, suggesting growth of 54.6% on a yearly basis. Gross profit from the segment is expected to be $598 million, suggesting growth of more than 100% from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe consensus mark for TSLA\u2019s revenues from the Services/Others unit is pegged at $2.43 billion, up from $2.15 billion recorded in the year-ago period.\u00a0The company\u2019s supercharging network business is primarily expected to boost the segment\u2019s revenues. Most auto giants like General Motors GM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA, among others, are adopting Tesla\u2019s NACS charging port standard.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nOver the past six months, shares of Tesla have moved up around 19%, outperforming the sector and the S&P 500 and almost matching the industry\u2019s growth.\n\n6-Month Price Comparison Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Tesla looks highly overvalued. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 7.47, higher than its median of 6.98 over the last five years. It is also trading at a huge premium compared to the industry\u2019s 1.53. The company has a Value Score of F. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThings Investors Should Note\n\nOf late, shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than in 2023 amid a cooling EV market. With competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer.\n\nTesla aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture. The successful introduction of its Full Self Driving software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. High liquidity and low leverage provide Tesla with the financial flexibility to tap growth opportunities. As such, the long-term prospects of the company appear promising.\n\nIs Now the Right Time to Buy TSLA?\n\nInvesting in Tesla now is essentially a bet on its driverless software and AI potential. However, the company's history of missed deadlines and the significant engineering and regulatory challenges of autonomous vehicle development warrant caution. Earlier this month, Tesla postponed its highly anticipated robotaxi event from Aug 8 to October. Investors should closely monitor Tesla\u2019s upcoming earnings report on Jul 23, where more details about the robotaxi project are expected. Given the company's currently stretched valuation, it will be prudent for investors to wait for more clarity and stability before taking a position in the stock.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Automation advancements have been incredible,\u00a0putting the spotlight on\u00a0the robotics sector as a whole. Indeed, the rise of artificial intelligence has boosted robotics use in manufacturing, healthcare, and e-commerce. This combination\u00a0has the potential to\u00a0revolutionize business processes and create vast new possibilities.\u00a0Many companies invest billions in robotics, and one\u00a0good example is\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nIn a recent event, Elon Musk emphasized the untapped economic potential of humanoid robots. He also said focusing on these can boost Tesla\u2019s market cap to $25 trillion. That said, investors might also want to set their eyes on specific pure-play robotic stocks and see how these opportunities amount to much more than \u201cjust\u201d robots.\n\nThe robotics sector has reached $283.19 billion in market value in 2023. Despite this, some strong robotics stocks have dipped due to competition, offering investors long-term gain opportunities. Below are compelling robotics stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the leader in robot-assisted surgeries,\u00a0Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) has a $156.88 billion market cap and has seen over 16.1% growth since 2019. The company is known for its da Vinci surgical system, which minimizes surgical trauma in patients.\u00a0This\u00a0has solidified the presence and potential of robotics in the medical sector, making the ISRG stock a must-have in every investor portfolio.\n\nIn my view,\u00a0surgeries\u00a0are only likely to\u00a0involve more robotics in the coming years.\u00a0The reality is that a\u00a0robotic arm is going to be much, much more accurate than any human in getting at the problem areas and fixing what needs fixing with minimal excess damage.\u00a0Using Intuitive Surgical\u2019s robotic assistance, surgeries become less of a game of\u00a0Operation and more of a precision task.\n\nSurging 31% year-to-date, ISRG stock has\u00a0truly\u00a0been an excellent bet.\u00a0That said,\u00a0I think\u00a0this growth can continue.\u00a0The company expects to grow revenue by 11% this year and anticipates $469 million in GAAP operating income in Q1 2024.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother leader in the medical and robotic space,\u00a0Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is among the more undervalued names I\u2019m looking at right now.\u00a0Approximately 80% of the company\u2019s revenues are recurring,\u00a0which means this is a stock that\u2019s\u00a0less sensitive to macroeconomic hurdles.\u00a0Importantly, Medtronic offers\u00a0strong\u00a0capital appreciation upside\u00a0as well as\u00a0income potential but only trades at around 14 times forward earnings. With more than 48 years of consecutive dividend payouts, this is about as stable a total return play in the healthcare space as they come.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, the company inaugurated its first large-scale\u00a0Global IT Center in Hyderabad, investing $60 million to create over 300 jobs in the next five years. The center will focus on building advanced tech like Cloud Engineering and Digital Health. Analysts have praised Medtronic\u2019s continued investments, noting that the market supports its innovative ecosystems.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Image of white paper airplanes on horizontal trajectory with one red paper airplane rising upward, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pasuwan\n\nThe successor to Rockwell Internation,\u00a0Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) now operates in software and control, smart devices, and lifecycle services. The company has a $33 billion market cap despite facing a revenue decline of 6.57% in the quarter ending March 31, 2024.\n\nNotably, Rockwell\u00a0focuses on hardware and software services to enhance\u00a0different\u00a0manufacturing processes.\u00a0Analysts remain cautious as shares of ROK stock declined 10% in 2024. However, the company provides consistent revenue streams and cash flows, reassuring investors. The stock currently trades 26 times trailing earnings and 3.4 times forward sales. However, analysts project the company\u2019s EPS could rise 18.33% to $12.01 by 2025, making it a robotics stock worth considering.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When investors think about battery stocks as investments, their first thought is likely to be the lithium-ion batteries that are essential to electric vehicles (EVs). But if you\u2019re looking for companies that may be worth a long-term investment, you may have to shift your focus.\n\nSince 2020, a number of startup companies are trying to capitalize on the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). Many of these companies have been involved in the production of lithium-ion batteries, which is the current standard for EVs.\n\nThe hope was that many of these battery stocks would be solid long-term investments. The reality is most of them may have made good trades at one time or another, but they\u2019ve been tough stocks to hold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is still a speculative area, but it\u2019s one that still holds significant promise. The shift towards renewable energy will continue. However, it may be time for investors with a long-term outlook to consider these battery stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, to help frame my case for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) it\u2019s important to look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThe latter company is known for its iconic iPhone and other products. But as Apple investors are aware, it generates a significant portion of its revenue from its Services business.\n\nIn a similar vein, Tesla enthusiasts have continually defended the company\u2019s lofty valuation with the idea that Tesla is more than a car company. And a significant piece of that story is the company\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business. In its first quarter 2024 earnings presentation, the company noted that business was likely to generate a stronger growth rate than its Automotive business.\n\nA 36% rally in the last month has pushed TSLA stock positive for the year. Many investors continue to be fixated on its EV business and with good reason. However, if you have a contrarian state of mind, it could be a time to hope that Tesla begins to resemble the next Apple in the minds of investors.\n\nQuantumScape (QS) QuantumScape (QS) is an American company that develops solid state lithium metal batteries for electric cars.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors frequently buy the rumor and sell the news. But it was news of a new agreement with PowerCo, a wholly owned subsidiary of Volkswagen(OTCMKTS:VWAGY) that sent shares of QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) rocketing higher.\n\nThe deal will allow PowerCo to utilize QuantumScape\u2019s QSE-5 solid-state technology to manufacture batteries. You can learn about the details of the deal in Eddie Pan\u2019s article for InvestorPlace. But a key takeaway is that PowerCo will provide QuantumScape with an initial $130 million royalty fee.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis comes at a critical time as QuantumScape is in the final stages of pushing its solid-state battery design into commercial production. If successful, the company\u2019s technology could become a replacement to the lithium-ion standard.\n\nNotably, the recent surge in QS stock is due in part to a short squeeze. That may not be enough to move analysts to push the stock higher. However, QuantumScape reports earnings on July 24. Investors looking to start a position should wait to gauge analyst sentiment after the earnings report.\n\nNano One Materials (NNOMF) a pile of lithium. lithium stocks\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.com\n\nIf QuantumScape isn\u2019t speculative enough, you may want to consider Nano One Materials (OTCMKTS:NNOMF). The Canadian company\u2019s proprietary and patented One-Pot process is working on removing sulphates from lithium-ion batteries that can lower the costs, complexity, carbon intensity and their environmental footprint.\n\nSodium sulphate is a by-product of the EV battery supply chain. The growing market for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is expanding this supply chain which is raising awareness of what to do with larger quantities of sodium sulfate.\n\nNNOMF is a penny stock today, but it\u2019s taken investors on a wild ride in the last five years. Like may companies related to EVs, the stock got caught up in the meme stock mania in 2022. And even last year, the stock was up approximately 40% at one point. But as consumer sentiment for EVs is cooling for many reasons, the stock is down 48% this year.\n\nThat\u2019s why you have to know what you own. This is a speculative investment. But if the company\u2019s technology can gain a foothold with EV manufacturers, it could be a multi-bagger.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in AAPL.

        "title": "3 Chinese Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Since the post-pandemic reopening, China\u2019s economy has struggled to return to its growth trajectory. Still, China is the second largest global economy, accounting for 15% of global exports. With sentiment washed out and trough valuations, it\u2019s time to consider some Chinese stocks to buy now.\n\nIn terms of sentiment, investors are extremely bearish on China, pointing to its real estate issues, slowing growth and geopolitical tensions. However, this could be a contrarian signal that it\u2019s time to consider buying China. Warren Buffet\u2019s maxim, \u201cbe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful, \u201d applies here.\n\nMoreover, the bargain valuations support the bullish thesis for Chinese stocks to buy now. According to JPMorgan Chase research, the MSCI China index trades at 9.4 times forward earnings compared to a historical average of 11.6. Moreover, considering that the S&P 500 is at a forward P/E of 21, Chinese stocks are too undervalued. These Chinese stocks to buy now are high-quality businesses that offer significant upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is losing market share to PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) and Douyin, it remains the largest e-commerce retailer in China by a significant margin. Moreover, the fact that China is the largest e-commerce market presents a favorable tailwind.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s e-commerce business is still growing at a healthy rate. For the quarter that ended March 31, Taobao and Tmall revenues were $12.9 billion, representing 4% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group segment grew 45% YOY, driven by strength at AliExpress and Trendyol\u2019s expansion into the Gulf Region.\n\nIts cloud intelligence segment, which provides database, elastic compute and AI products, grew by 3%. While somewhat disappointing, AI-related revenues were a huge lift as they accelerated, growing at a triple-digit pace in the quarter.\n\nLooking forward, AI will be a massive growth tailwind for Alibaba. Already, it\u2019s a leader, as demonstrated by the favorable ranking of its large language model, Qwen. This advanced model has attracted over 90,000 enterprise deployments.\n\nCombining the cash flow from its e-commerce businesses and the opportunity in AI, Alibaba is among the top Chinese stocks to buy now. It trades at 10 times forward earnings and is returning value to shareholders through its $25 billion buyback.\n\nYum China (YUMC) A banner for Yum China (YUMC) decorates the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nYum China (NYSE:YUMC) is the largest restaurant chain in China based on 2023 system sales. As of March 31, it had 15,022 restaurants operating in over 2,000 Chinese cities. Its network consists of flagship brands like Pizza Hut and KFC as well as emerging ones like Taco Bell, Huang Ji Huang, Lavazza and Little Sheep.\n\nThere are several reasons why Yum China is one of the best Chinese stocks to buy. First, the valuation is very attractive compared to its historical average. As of this writing, it trades at 15 times forward non-GAAP earnings compared to the 5-year average of 34.\n\nSecondly, the restaurant operator has a multiyear growth runway in China, which is supported by several factors. Increasing disposable incomes in China plus strong brand recognition means Yum Brand can increase locations in China substantially. For instance, KFC, which has the leading market share in China, has no presence in 1,200 Chinese cities, presenting a massive growth opportunity.\n\nThe company continues opening new stores at a rapid pace, with 378 new restaurants in Q1 2024. Management expects to open 1,500 to 1,700 net new stores in 2024 and targets 20,000 restaurants by 2026. The new openings combined with other topline drivers such as menu innovation and its 300 million loyalty program members mean YUMC stock is a buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nOften referred to as the Google of China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is the undisputed leader in the Chinese search market, with a 53.3% market share. Although Baidu has other emerging businesses, advertising is the main source of revenue. In 2023, online marketing services, which represents revenue from Baidu Core online marketing services and iQiyi online advertising services, accounted for over 60% of revenues.\n\nBesides search, Baidu has several emerging businesses that are new growth drivers. Its cloud services division grew revenues by 6% in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Another exciting growth engine is its artificial intelligence, particularly its ERNIE family of models.\n\nSo far, Baidu has emerged as a leader in generative AI with ERNIE and launched several lightweight large language models in Q1 2024. It\u2019s using these capabilities to provide AI tools to support the development of customized models, AI agents and AI-native applications.\n\nAnother boost to Baidu will come from its autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go. In Q1 2024, the service provided about 826,000 rides, up 25% YOY. Moreover, a reported partnership where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) full-service driving would use Baidu\u2019s navigation and mapping services is a positive. Altogether, AI cloud and intelligent driving make BIDU stock one of the top Chinese stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in BABA but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Column: Who elected Elon Musk our arbiter of social norms?",
        "content": "Here's a handy two-step process for taking a thoughtful and judicious approach to the burning social and political issues of our time:\n\n1. Examine closely the position taken by Elon Musk, and;\n\n2. Go the other way.\n\nMusk's drift \u2014 more precisely, his headlong dive \u2014 into right-wing orthodoxies has been well-chronicled. He has openly endorsed antisemitic tropes, called for the prosecution of the respected immunologist Anthony Fauci (evidently buying into the right-wing fantasy that Fauci helped create the COVID-19 pandemic), and associated himself with a grotesquely ugly conspiracy theory about the assault on the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThis is the final straw.\n\nElon Musk, explaining that California's pro-transgender law provoked him to relocating his companies to Texas\n\nHe reversed policies at X, formerly Twitter, designed to block hate speech, including racist and antisemitic tweets. That has turned the platform into a hive of repulsive partisan commentary.\n\n(Musk blames an imaginary advertisers' \"boycott\" for the user decline at X, though the repulsive atmosphere of the platform since his acquisition probably has done more to drive users and advertisers away.)\n\nMusk again put his acrid personal worldview vividly on display with his announcement Tuesday that he would move two of his private companies, Hawthorne-based SpaceX and San Francisco-based X, to Texas.\n\nHe made clear that his decision was triggered by Gov. Gavin Newsom's signing of a law that bars school districts from requiring teachers to notify parents of their children's gender identity changes. Newsom signed the law on Monday.\n\n\"This is the final straw,\" Musk posted on X. He described the law as one of \"many others\" in California \"attacking both families and companies.\"\n\nThis is the final straw. \r\n\r\nBecause of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas. https://t.co/cpWUDgBWFe\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 16, 2024\n\nA few things about this.\n\nIf anything, Musk's corporate activities point to what is often described as a \"whim of iron.\" He defends his policies and politics as derived from painstaking consideration based on immutable laws of human behavior, but they don't hold water on those terms. Instead, they point to the social dangers of endowing self-interested personalities with the money to buy unaccountable influence in conflict with the public interest.\n\nMusk appears to have a real problem with transgender rights. According to the Musk biography by Walter Isaacson, this may have originated with the decision of his eldest child, Xavier, to transition at the age of 16. \"I\u2019m transgender, and my name is now Jenna,\u201d she texted a relative. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my dad.\u201d\n\nJenna followed up with a political awakening that Musk ascribed to her attendance at a private school in California. \u201cShe went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil,\u201d he told Isaacson. Jenna broke off all contact with him.\n\nFurther, as is the case with much of Musk's worldview, his claim about California's attacks on families and companies is fundamentally incoherent.\n\nThe new California law is the antithesis of an attack on families. It aims to protect the right of parents to seek the most appropriate medical treatments for their children. Anti-transgender activists who have gotten laws enacted in 20 red states interfering with these medical consultations typically characterize them as \"parents' rights\" measures, when they're just the opposite \u2014 they interpose right-wing ideologies between these families and their doctors.\n\nRead more:Column: Elon Musk thinks Tesla's investors love him. He's very wrong\n\nThat's the state of play in Texas, the putative new home of SpaceX and X. There, a law that became effective on Sept. 1, 2023, prohibited treatments widely accepted by medical professionals for \"gender dysphoria\" experienced by adolescents.\n\nThese are chiefly the use of puberty blockers to give the patients more time to affirm their gender perception, and once that stage is achieved the use of cross-sex hormones \u2014estrogen for males transitioning to female, and testosterone for females transitioning to male.\n\nThe Texas law threatens physicians who violate the law in treating their patients with the loss of their medical license.\n\nA trial judge, ruling in a lawsuit brought by parents of transgender youths and by doctors who treat patients in that position, blocked the law shortly before it was to take effect. The injunction was overturned late last month by the Texas Supreme Court in an 8-1 decision.\n\nThe majority made clear that its decision had nothing to do with the weight of medical opinion, which overwhelmingly supported the treatments at issue when undertaken through careful consultation.\n\nThe issue at the heart of the debate, asserted Justice James D. Blacklock in a concurring opinion, \u201cis one of philosophy, morality, even religion. The medical debates at issue in this litigation are merely the surface-level consequences of deep disagreement over the deepest of questions about who we are.\u201d \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe majority justices ruled that the Legislature was entirely within its rights to place limits on medical practice and parental authority in Texas. They asserted that barring parents from seeking medically indicated treatment of their children\u2019s gender dysphoria was no different from a state law forbidding minors from getting tattoos, even with their parents\u2019 permission.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d responded Justice Debra H. Lehrmann, the court\u2019s lone dissenter, \u201cthere is nothing remotely medically necessary about tattooing.\u201d Depriving adolescents of gender dysphoria therapies, on the other hand, can be severely injurious to the patient\u2019s physical and mental health.\n\nRead more:Column: Elon Musk is suing to stop the government from enforcing labor laws. The Supreme Court might agree with him\n\nIf Musk thinks that Texas\u2019 policies on parental rights are superior to California\u2019s, he might ask the parents of transgender youths who have been driven out of Texas to seek treatment because of this ignorant and ideologically infected law. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTexas boosters, Musk included, like to describe the state as the coming place for venture investing. The truth is rather different. According to the National Venture Capital Assn., Texas has been mired in also-ran status for at least the last decade, a period in which it has been supposedly booming.\n\nCalifornia's position as the top state in venture funding has never been seriously challenged. In 2023, California VC funds raised $37 billion; Texas ranked seventh, with less than $1.2 billion. Of the top 10 venture deals by value last year, the NVCA reckons, eight involved California companies. The others were located in New York and Washington, D.C. Texas had none.\n\nAnd in terms of assets under management by firms based in the state, California continues to reign with $644.5 billion as of last year. Texas ranks fifth, at less than $32.5 billion. It was edged out by No. 4 Florida, with $33.6 billion, but the figures for both Florida and Texas are a big drop-off from No. 3, Massachusetts, with $121.7 billion.\n\nIt's not as if Austin, where Musk is hanging his Texas Stetson, offers newcomers a paradisiacal environment. In 2022, TechCrunch dubbed Austin \"a city of unicorns and tech giants.\" The thrill hasn't lasted. Recent transplants have found that its boosters' depiction of a vibrant intellectual climate was oversold. \"Austin is where ambition goes to die,\" an unhappy California immigrant told Business Insider.\n\nThen there are its punishing summers \u2014 78 days of triple-digit temperatures in 2023 \u2014 and soaring housing prices. Although Austin boasts one of the features of tech hubs, a leading research institution in the University of Texas, the state's partisan political environment has turned increasingly hostile, with bills passed into law this year banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and narrowing faculty tenure protections.\n\nTexas has the most restrictive anti-abortion law in the nation, with an almost total ban and a prohibition even on private health plan coverage of abortions. That hardly makes for an inviting prospect for women of childbearing age or for young families interested in the full range of reproductive healthcare options.\n\nOne advantage Texas has over California is something a rich entrepreneur like Musk would appreciate the most: It has no state income tax.\n\nMusk can scarcely claim that his own corporate policies are family-friendly. They are, however, arguably self-destructive. Consider his treatment of thousands of former Twitter employees who were summarily fired after he took over the platform in October 2022 and are suing to receive severance payments, bonuses and other benefits they were promised before the takeover.\n\nRead more:Column: A judge voids Musk's huge Tesla pay package as dishonest, and hoo boy, is Musk steamed\n\nThe mass firings have given rise to about 2,000 arbitration cases and a dozen class-action lawsuits, according to Shannon Liss-Riordan, a Massachusetts labor lawyer who represents the workers in arbitration and filed the lawsuits.\n\nAmong the workers' claims is that while Musk was working to close his acquisition of Twitter, as it was then known, the company promised employees that they would be entitled to \"benefits and severance at least as favorable\" as what Twitter provided before the Musk takeover. The promises were made by company executives in a series of all-hands meetings at Twitter headquarters and were written into the merger agreement Musk and Twitter management negotiated in April 2022.\n\n\"The promises were made to keep employees from fleeing the company during those chaotic months before Musk closed on the acquisition,\" Liss-Riordan told me. \"Then after he closed, he just defaulted on that promise.\"\n\nNeither Musk nor spokespersons for X or SpaceX could be reached for comment.\n\nAlthough many if not most of the X employees were required to bring their claims to arbitration, Musk initially refused to pay the arbitration fees that are typically charged to the employer in such cases.\n\nThat has frozen the proceedings in more than 800 cases, though not those originating in California, Oregon and Nevada, where employers don't have the legal ability to refuse. About a third of the 2,000 arbitration claims are in California, Liss-Riordan says.\n\nLeaving aside the ethical implications of a company's forcing employees into arbitration and then refusing to allow the cases to proceed, Musk's demand that ex-employees submit to arbitration may be exceptionally more costly for the company than trying to reach a general settlement. Arbitration fees can average $100,000 per case, Liss-Riordan told me; hundreds of millions of dollars in claims may be at issue.\n\n\"You have to scratch your head over why Elon Musk has to fight this so hard,\" she says. \"Would it really be that big a deal to pay the employees what was promised to them? Frankly, it doesn't seem worth his time.\"\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Friday amid persistent concerns over a renewed trade war between the U.S. and China, while positive earnings from TSMC did little to stop a rout in technology stocks.\n\nRegional markets took negative cues from their U.S. peers, as an extended rotation out of technology stocks sparked overnight losses on Wall Street. U.S. stock benchmarks tumbled from record highs over the past three sessions.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose mildly in Asian trade, as a rout on Wall Street appeared to be somewhat easing. Focus also turned to a slew of key U.S. earnings due in the coming days, with majors including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) set to report.\n\nChinese stocks down on US trade jitters; stimulus hopes dampen losses\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell slightly on Friday, although they were trading above intraday lows.\n\nMedia reports this week suggested that the U.S. was considering stricter trade restrictions against China, especially the country\u2019s technology and chipmaking sectors.\n\nThe reports ramped up concerns over a renewed trade war between Beijing and Washington, given that trade relations between the two are already strained.\n\nSpeculation over a second Donald Trump presidency also dented Chinese stocks, given that Trump has maintained a largely negative rhetoric against Beijing.\n\nStill, losses in Chinese stocks were dampened by promises of more supportive policy from the Chinese government, as the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party carried on.\n\nTech rout persists, TSMC offers little support to chipmakers\n\nTechnology-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia, as the sector continued to grapple with profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a broad pivot into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nLosses in tech dragged Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 down 0.4%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index slid over 2%.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI shed 1.5% on losses in chipmaking stocks.\n\nChipmaking stocks slid even as industry major TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) clocked stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, and upgraded its outlook on the prospect of strong demand from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe firm\u2019s Taipei shares fell 2%, as sentiment towards Taiwan was also rattled by comments from U.S. Republican presidential candidate Trump, who said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nBroader Asian stocks fell as sentiment remained dour. Concerns over China saw Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index slide 1.1%, with local stocks also seeing profit-taking after racing to record highs earlier in the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan\u2019s TOPIX fell 0.6%, as softer-than-expected consumer price index data raised questions over whether the Bank of Japan will hike interest rates soon.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, as the index neared a record-high 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as US-China jitters persist; TSMC sparks little cheer\n\nTSMC shares fall nearly 2% even after raising 2024 revenue forecast\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Thursday as a broad rotation out of heavyweight technology stocks appeared to have eased before a string of key earnings from the sector next week.\n\nBut sentiment still remained fragile following underwhelming earnings from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), while uncertainty over U.S. politics also weighed amid growing calls for President Joe Biden to withdraw his reelection bid.\n\nS&P 500 Futuresrose 0.1% to 5,602.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,946.50 points by 19:47 ET (23:47 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,985.0 points.\n\nTech stocks steady after bruising losses\n\nMajor technology stocks steadied in aftermarket trading, after clocking steep losses over the past two sessions. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose slightly in evening trade.\n\nA mix of profit-taking and a rotation into sectors more primed to benefit from an economic recovery had battered major technology stocks over the past two sessions.\n\nNetflix fell slightly in aftermarket trade after its second quarter earnings missed expectations.\n\nHeavyweight chipmaking stocks were also rattled by the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on China, especially on the country\u2019s chipmaking sector.\n\nLosses in tech sparked deep losses on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% at 5,544.59 points on Thursday. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.7% to 17,874.45 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.3% to 17,874.45 points.\n\nHeavyweight tech earnings on tap, TSMC supports chipmakers\n\nFocus was now squarely on key upcoming earnings from the tech sector next week. Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)are all set to report on Tuesday, with the two internet giants set to offer more cues on artificial intelligence after a massive valuation spike over the past year.\n\nTesla will be watched for how the electric car maker is navigating a steep decline in sales this year.\n\nPositive earnings from chipmaking bellwethers ASML (AS:ASML) Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) aided chipmaking stocks on Thursday. TSMC rose slightly after it clocked stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker also hiking its outlook on strong AI-fueled demand.\n\nPolitical wrangling in focus as calls grow for Biden to exit race\n\nThe 2024 presidential race was also a point of focus for Wall Street, amid growing calls from members of the Democratic party for Biden to not seek re-election.\n\nReports on Thursday said former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi had told House democrats that Biden could be persuaded to exit the race.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s health, coupled with the increasing popularity of Republican nominee Donald Trump, have sparked doubts over whether Biden will be able to clinch a second term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited\n\nEmbraer deliveries rise 88% in second quarter, order backlog at 7-year high\n\nFired Citigroup banker says COO intended to deceive regulator on bank's metrics\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - The California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA) released its California Auto Outlook Report on Thursday, summarizing new vehicle registrations and forecasting annual sales.\n\nThe report indicates a slight dip in California's new light vehicle registrations. Despite this, the state is projected to reach a forecasted 1.8 million new vehicle registrations by the year's end.\n\nA key highlight from the report is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) declining market presence in California. The electric vehicle (EV) giant's registrations have dropped a significant 17% year-to-date (YTD), marking the third consecutive quarter of registration declines for the brand.\n\nWhile Tesla's Model Y remains the top-selling car in the state, the data suggests that Tesla sales may have reached their peak in California.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional automakers like Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF) (LON:HYUNDAIq), and Ford (NYSE:F) have seen a surge in popularity, particularly in their EV models. Toyota and Hyundai's battery electric vehicle (BEV) registrations rose by 108.1% and 65.7% respectively. Hyundai's Ioniq 5 notably took third place in the top-selling EVs in California YTD, surpassing Tesla's Model X.\n\nDavid Simpson, CNCDA Chairman, expressed his excitement about the evolving auto market, stating, \"With new competitive EV models and the latest ICE options, we're able to meet diverse customers\u2019 needs and provide the support they want from their local dealership.\"\n\nToyota continues to dominate the Californian market with 150,964 registrations and a 16.9% market share. California also leads the nation in BEV registrations, with BEVs accounting for 21.4% of sales YTD.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, combined sales of BEVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles accounted for 38% of the market share in California, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles made up the remaining 62%.\n\nDespite Tesla's declining market presence, it remains the second-best selling brand in California with 102,106 registrations YTD. However, the brand's market share has dipped 2.3 points from last year, and Q2 2024 registrations have fallen 24.1% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nThe report also notes regional variations in BEV market share, with Northern California leading at 24.9%, followed by Southern California at 22.1%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCalifornia Auto Outlook Q2: Tesla's California sales slip 17% YTD, rivals surge\n\nStocks ease as tech sell-off spreads, data boosts dollar\n\nOpenAI holds talks with Broadcom about developing new AI chip, the Information reports\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - A survey conducted by Morgan Stanley on Thursday suggests that investors view artificial intelligence (AI) as a more significant growth driver for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) than electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThe survey, which collected responses from 137 participants over a 24-hour period, revealed that AI was seen as a more influential factor by a 2:1 ratio.\n\nThe survey also indicated nearly evenly divided opinions on Tesla's stock performance over the next 12 months. Additionally, the respondents suggested it might be time to consider the implications of Tesla's fourth master plan (MP4), which could assume new significance depending on the outcome of the upcoming US elections.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro!

        "title": "Harley-Davidson (HOG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Harley-Davidson (HOG) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 25, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis motorcycle maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.2%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $1.38 billion, up 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.54% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Harley-Davidson?\n\nFor Harley-Davidson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.06%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Harley-Davidson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Harley-Davidson would post earnings of $1.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.72, delivering a surprise of +16.22%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nHarley-Davidson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAnother stock from the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, Tesla (TSLA), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.62 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -31.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $25.13 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Tesla has been revised 0.8% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.13%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Donald Trump wants Taiwan to pay for U.S. protection\u2014and that should worry shareholders of Nvidia, Microsoft and Tesla",
        "content": "Taiwan needs to pay more protection money to the United States if it wants to prevent China from invading, Donald Trump said in comments that pose serious implications for leading artificial intelligence companies.\n\nThe island nation, which China views as its sovereign territory, is the number one manufacturing hub for cutting-edge semiconductors like the Nvidia H100 graphic processors that powers generative AI data centers used by the likes of Microsoft, Google, Amazon as well as Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla and his latest startup xAI.\n\nBut Beijing's threat of invasion or naval blockade has investors worried. Last year, Warren Buffett sold his entire stake in the country's leading chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), to avoid any unnecessary risks.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Trump only heightened those risks by likening America to an insurance provider for the country: \u201cI think Taiwan should pay us for defense.\u201d\n\nMaking such a statement publicly tells rivals like China that the country's political winds are shifting, inviting them to exploit the weakness.\n\nTogether with speculation the Biden administration, trailing Trump in key swing state polls, is weighing whether to tighten export controls of advanced semiconductor equipment further, chip stocks took a beating during Wednesday\u2019s trading.\n\nThe Philidelphia semiconductor index fell 7% in the session.\n\nTaiwan's TSMC irreplaceable for Nvidia\n\nTaiwan's security is so important to Nvidia and, by extension, the Big Tech companies it supplies because Nvidia\u2014unlike Intel\u2014never sought to fabricate its own chips.\n\nInstead, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang\u2014a Taiwan native\u2014outsourced production to so-called foundries like TSMC.\n\nFounded in 1987 by former Texas Instruments executive Morris Chang, TSMC grew into the largest foundry in the world.\n\nIt is the sole provider of Nvidia\u2019s AI training chips and cannot be replaced since it possesses the most advanced form of miniaturization on the market.\n\nAs a result, even though TSMC does not design AI chips, its unique stranglehold on supply has seen it ride the same AI wave as Nvidia.\n\nEarlier this month, it became the first East Asian company to break through the $1 trillion market cap threshold.\n\nOn Thursday, the company hiked its revenue forecast after robust quarterly results.\n\nResentment at Taiwanese industry's success\n\nThe island\u2019s semiconductor industry is so vital to U.S. interests that researchers with the Army War College have explored scorched-earth scenarios advocating the demolition of its chip fabs in the event of an invasion to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Chinese.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn his interview with Bloomberg, however, the publication reported that Trump was, at best, lukewarm about standing up to Chinese aggression, in part because he resented Taiwan chipmakers that outcompeted their U.S. peers.\n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d the real estate magnate asked at his Florida home in Mar-a-Lago. \u201cHow stupid are we? They took all of our chip business.\u201d\n\nHis implicit threat that the security umbrella could be withdrawn at any time under a new Trump administration is reminiscent of a stance taken during the campaign by his then-opponent, Vivek Ramaswamy, who promised to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion only until the U.S. could make the chips itself.\n\nTaipei downplays Trump comments\n\nIn private, this could send a powerful message to lawmakers in Taipei that they need to further open their market to key U.S. imports like pork, which was until recently banned over America's continued use of a controversial additive called Ractopamine.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday about Trump\u2019s demand for the country to pay up, Taiwan\u2019s head of government sought to lower temperatures by saying it was stepping up to meet the growing military needs.\n\n\u201cTaiwan has steadily strengthened its defense budget and adjusted the conscription serving period,\u201d premier Cho Jung-tai\u00a0told reporters, adding the country is \u201cwilling to take on more responsibility\u201d on security issues.\n\nAfter heavy losses, shares in Nvidia and Tesla, as well as TSMC\u2019s U.S.-listed ADR shares, are expected to open higher on Thursday when trading begins.\n\nBut this issue may not go away as long as Trump maintains the U.S. alliance with Taiwan is transactional only.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The S&P 500 has continues to edge higher.\n\nA softer-than-expected inflation report for June fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September. Several major investment advisory firms sifted their forecasts for Fed rate cuts and stock downgrades.\n\nThe CPI report showed only a slight 0.06% increase in core inflation, excluding food and energy prices. The data suggests a deceleration in inflation since the beginning of the year. A notable slowdown in the previously high housing services inflation hints at diminishing inflationary pressures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe moderation in core CPI elements has led analysts to believe that the inflation trend is on a downward trajectory. Discrepancies exist between the CPI and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. But, the overall pattern indicates a sustained reduction in inflation rates.\n\nEarlier in the week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shared his concerns about achieving a balanced economic \u2018soft landing.\u2019 This involves managing inflation without undermining the employment market.\n\nThe recent cooling of the labor market has lessened the threat of wage-driven inflation. But it also raises concerns about potential increases in unemployment. In the past, the robust labor market granted the Fed the leeway to wait for clear signs of easing inflation before making policy changes. However, current conditions suggest that delaying rate cuts could carry greater risks.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) economists project that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in September, followed by an additional 25 basis point cut in December. Evercore also expects a rate cut in September.\n\nAs a result of this improving macro backdrop, valuations are becoming stretched. And analysts are forced to cut ratings on the biggest winners, resulting in stock downgrades.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNomura (NYSE:NMR) adjusted its rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), shifting from a buy to a neutral rating. The firm has maintained its price target for the company at $930.00.\n\nThe change in rating comes after Super Micro Computer offered strong guidance for the periods of CY4Q23 to CY1Q24. The analyst notes that the company\u2019s position has evolved from easily surpassing modest market expectations in CY4Q23 to facing a tighter margin for exceeding the already elevated market expectations in CY1Q24.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift is attributed to two main uncertainties: the gradual easing of CoWoS-S supply in CY2024F and the potential transition period between Hopper and Blackwell GPUs in the second half of CY2024F.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the analyst acknowledges SMCI\u2019s competitive edge with its liquid cooling solutions, which are expected to support the company\u2019s gross profit margin (GPM). However, the limited order visibility, due to the aforementioned uncertainties, may challenge Super Micro Computer\u2019s ability to achieve sales that surpass expectations, leading to stock downgrades.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nUBS Group (NYSE:UBS) analysts lowered the rating for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares from neutral to sell, despite increasing the price target from $147 to $197. The analysts pointed out that Tesla is recognized for more than its automotive sector. It has promising developments in Energy and Full Self-Driving (FSD). However, the expectations for its core Auto business are declining.\n\nTSLA is poised to report earnings on July 23rd, following a strong Q2 delivery performance. Analyst consensus estimates the Q2 earnings per share (EPS) at 47 cents. The last time Tesla exceeded EPS expectations was in Q2 of 2023, with a 13% surprise.\n\nAnalysts concluded that the current market valuation leaves a significant portion, over $500 billion, attributed to anticipated future growth. To rationalize the present stock prices, a future value of $1 trillion would need to be realized within five years.\n\nThe report further stated that Tesla\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology is substantial. But the returns may be long-term and the rate of progress could decelerate. The concern is that if market interest in AI wanes, Tesla\u2019s stock multiple might be affected.\n\nGiven these uncertainties and the potential for growth opportunities to emerge later than expected or not at all, coupled with the stock trading at 86 times next twelve months (NTM) price-to-earnings (P/E), the downgrade to sell was justified.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw New Street Research cut its rating on the company\u2019s shares last week. The research firm downgraded NVIDIA from buy to neutral, setting the price target at $135.00. Stock downgrades like this reflect growing concerns in the market.\n\nThe downgrade was prompted by the analyst\u2019s view that NVDA\u2019s upside potential is limited under the current conditions. The consensus among market participants suggests that GPU revenues are expected to rise by 35% by 2025, aligning with previous forecasts.\n\nHowever, the firm sees little room for further growth based on the latest insights from the value chain. According to New Street Research, the likelihood of significant gains for NVIDIA\u2019s stock hinges on a bullish scenario. That would be if the outlook beyond 2025 markedly improves.\n\nCurrently, there is no strong conviction that this scenario will unfold. Market projections indicate a revenue growth deceleration to mid-teens. And this might be threatened by a slowdown in hyperscale capital expenditures and increased competition from ASICs and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThe quality of NVIDIA\u2019s franchise remains solid, and the firm would consider re-entering a buying position should the stock demonstrate prolonged weakness.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "EV stocks have largely been depressed in the last 12 to 18 months. The fundamental reasons include macroeconomic headwinds, slower than expected EV adoption and competition. I can say with some conviction that several EV players will perish in the next few years on the back of cash burn and intense competition.\n\nHowever, fundamentally strong EV companies will survive and continue to grow at a healthy rate. It\u2019s therefore time to separate the winners from the losers. Further, given the valuations, it makes sense to consider exposure to quality EV stocks and hold with patience.\n\nI have no doubt that the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) will make a strong comeback. However, this column is focused on the relatively smaller companies that can be massive value creators. Investors should have a long-term investment horizon for 10x to 20x returns from these EV stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the fundamental reasons to be bullish.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is among the EV stocks that can deliver 10x to 20x returns by the end of the decade. This view is underscored by strong fundamentals, continued product launches and focus on innovation. It\u2019s worth noting that LI stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 18.9 and valuations are attractive considering the growth momentum.\n\nThe first point to note is that Li Auto ended Q1 2024 with a robust cash buffer of $13.7 billion. Further, the EV company had reported free cash flow of $6.22 billion. Therefore, financial flexibility is high for investment in research and development. At the same time, Li Auto has been aggressively expanding its retail network in China that\u2019s likely to support growth.\n\nI must add here that Li Auto is likely to launch level 3 self-driving technology by 2025. Global expansion also seems to be on the cards with focus on the Middle East. With a technological edge and multiple catalysts for revenue growth, I am bullish on LI stock.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter an extended period of correction, Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) stock has surged by nearly 55% in the last six months. The rally has been backed by positive business developments and I expect the uptrend to sustain.\n\nFor Q1 2024, the company reported revenue growth of 73% on a YOY basis to $37.6 million. It\u2019s worth noting that there is ample headroom for EV charging infrastructure penetration in the United States and Europe. With a big addressable market, I expect healthy revenue growth to sustain for Blink Charging.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, Blink has addressed the challenge related to cash burn. With operating leverage and cost cutting, the EV charging company is targeting positive adjusted EBITDA by December. EBITDA margin expansion is likely to sustain in the coming years as services revenue swells.\n\nIn another important development, Blink received \u201cIn Process\u201d designation granted by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program for its EV charging solutions. This takes the company closer to being a cloud-based EV charging solutions provider to the U.S. government.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) lithium stocks Lithium-elements on periodic table 3d illustration. Top Lithium Stocks for Wealth\n\nSource: tunasalmon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen talking about electric vehicle stocks, it\u2019s difficult to ignore lithium miners. In the last 12 months, lithium stocks have plunged on the back of a steep decline in the metal prices. However, if EV adoption remains in an uptrend, lithium will make a comeback. I consider Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) as a high-risk bet. Having said that, some exposure can be considered as 10x to 20x returns seem likely once lithium trends higher.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Lithium Americas is the owner of the Thacker Pass asset. In the long term, the asset is a cash flow machine. To put things into perspective, Thacker Pass has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Once both phases are operational, the asset has the potential to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $2 billion.\n\nThe positive point to note is that Lithium Americas is fully financed for the construction of the first phase of the project. It\u2019s a matter of holding with patience when sentiments are over bearish. A strong reversal from undervalued levels is on the cards.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Steer Clear of Nio Stock as It Battles EU Tariffs and Stiff Competition",
        "content": "One of the most well-known Chinese EV makers in the market, Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock is a name I\u2019ve been bullish on in the past. Indeed, we\u2019re all aware that the EV market is going to grow, and China has led the way. One might think that this pure-play BEV maker based out of China should benefit from strong demographic growth trends.\n\nHowever, Nio has faced some hurdles over the past year because of the company\u2019s exposure to the high end of the market. In Q2 2024, NIO reported 57,373 vehicles delivered, with a cumulative 537,020 units delivered.\n\nHowever, with new EU tariffs and high valuation risks, this may negatively affect NIO stock, which has already dropped 50% year-to-date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company continues to struggle with fierce competition from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF). This has led to Nio capturing less than 2% of the Chinese market. Additionally, demand for EVs weakened, and Nio\u2019s battery-swapping model appears to have proved costly and unlikely to gain global traction.\n\nWith rising losses and declining vehicle deliveries, investors may have better alternatives out there right now.\n\nDeliveries Are Still Down\n\nIn early June, NIO announced May deliveries of 20,544 vehicles, marking a 233.8% year-over-year increase. This included 12,164 premium electric SUVs and 8,380 sedans, bringing the company\u2019s total cumulative deliveries to 515,811.\n\nNIO\u2019s SUVs, such as the ES6, ES7, and ES8 models, continue to remain more popular than its sedans.\n\nDespite strong delivery numbers, NIO faces stiff competition from larger Chinese market players like BYD, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), and Tesla, each of whom hold more significant market share.\n\nXiaomi\u2019s entry with its SU7 sedan, delivering 7,000 vehicles in April and increasing to 8,630 in May, poses a challenge to NIO, potentially closing the gap as Xiaomi ramps up production.\n\nRoadblocks From the EU\n\nNIO stock declined over 60% in 2023, trading well below its initial IPO price. This has been led by declining deliveries and shrinking margins, as various supply chain issues have unfolded. However, there are more pertinent recent headwinds for the Chinese EV maker.\n\nNio\u2019s unique swappable batteries and European expansion face a setback with new tariffs in the EU ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, including a 20.8% tariff for Nio. This tariff is added to the existing 10% import duty.\n\nNio plans to maintain current European prices but might raise them later because of these tariffs.\n\nNio could avoid tariffs by manufacturing in Europe, but higher production costs would likely negate the benefits. Currently, Li aims to strengthen European partnerships and scale operations for viable production.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, Europe remains a small market for Nio, with just 100 deliveries in 2021 and 1,296 in 2022, compared to 91,429 and 122,486 globally. That said, for a company that\u2019s valued based on its growth prospects, this is certainly a headwind investors are going to price in here.\n\nNio\u2019s stock might become a value play if it overcomes challenges in China and scales in Europe. Speculators may consider buying now, but stock pressure may persist until vehicle margins improve, losses narrow, and European expansion proves sustainable. Valuation could remain low due to trade and geopolitical tensions.\n\nSteer Clear of NIO Stock\n\nNio has faced ongoing trade frictions with the U.S. and Europe, yet it doubled down on its growth prospects, projecting Q2 2024 deliveries of 54,000 to 56,000 units, marking a 129.6% to 138.1% increase year-over-year. Despite international challenges, Nio expects revenue growth accelerating from 89.1% to 95.3%, reaching $2.373 billion over the next year.\n\nI\u2019m not so sure the company will hit these targets. Nio faces challenges in meeting ambitious goals amid tough conditions for Chinese EV makers. Its heavy focus on Onvo models raised concerns about differentiation.\n\nAs a result, NIO stock is one I think is worth waiting on, for investors who believe the Chinese EV sector will eventually turn the corner. I just think it\u2019s going to be possible to pick up NIO stock at better levels moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy at New Lows in July",
        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) companies, for the most part, are still reeling from a broader slump in the market. Some EV makers have seen their sales decline and others their margins. Ever since the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates in order to combat rising inflation, new car buyers have struggled to take on increasingly expensive car notes. In turn, EV companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) and many others have had to resort to discounts to entice new customers.\n\nThankfully, the ongoing slump will not last forever. EVs have become a significant consideration for new car buyers, and the demand for them most likely is not going anywhere. Moreover, inflation in the United States appears to be going downward. The last few inflation reports have come in lower than many economists expected. If more good news on the macroeconomic front comes out, there is a good chance the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates. With that in mind, some EV stocks at all-time lows or 52-week lows are worth a buy.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD is on its way to being the largest EV maker in the world, again taking the crown away from its American counterpart, Tesla. Despite a slow start to the year, BYD ended the first quarter with sales jumping 46% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis to 301,631 vehicles. Pure battery vehicles made up 139,902 of those sales. Hybrids made up the other significant portion. Tesla, on the other hand, reported its first deliveries decline since the pandemic years. In the second quarter, BYD continued to astound analysts. BYD EV sales increased 21% YOY to 426,039. Again, Tesla\u2019s deliveries figure experienced a decline during the same period. In particular, Tesla deliveries declined 4.8% YOY to 443,956.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD saw its shares fall nearly 9% over the past 12 months, meaning the stock is heading toward its 52-week low. The EV maker\u2019s international expansion and dominance in China\u2019s dynamic EV market make BYD a Strong Buy. Also, BYD trades 21x forward earnings, a valuation multiple that is a fraction of Tesla\u2019s.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is another Chinese EV maker that has seen its share price decline due to investors feeling skittish about Chinese stocks in general. The Chinese EV maker is a specialist in developing and manufacturing high-end electric SUVs and the company also competes directly with Tesla. While Tesla has seen delivery declines in recent quarters, Li Auto has continued to expand deliveries growth. In the first quarter, deliveries increased 52.9% YOY to 80,400 vehicles. Despite strong sales growth, however, margins and net income did suffer. The price war has definitely taken a toll on Li Auto\u2019s bottom line, especially as the EV maker tries to compete in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second quarter also saw Li Auto gain more success in delivering new vehicles. LI\u2019s deliveries figure increased 25.5% YOY to 108,581 vehicles. While this bout of good news sent LI shares into rally mode in recent weeks, the Chinese premium EV maker\u2019s share price has declined 42%. Li Auto\u2019s success in capturing market share in China and keeping Tesla on its toes make it a good long-term bet. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that LI shares trade at a relatively cheap 12.9x forward earnings.\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in EV stocks does not just have to do with buying up the shares of EV makers. Diversifying to the materials and resource companies that extract lithium carbonate \u2014 the rare earth mineral necessary to develop lithium-ion batteries \u2014 could also make a lucrative bet for long-term investors. Of course, the shares of lithium miners, who have benefitted from supplying large EV makers with the rare earth mineral, have experienced downward pressure. The glut in the lithium market as well as tapering demand in the EV end-market have sent the profits of lithium miners plummeting. Still, large miners like Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) are trading at a 52-week low and an attractive valuation multiple.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, SQM is the world\u2019s second-largest lithium provider, and the miner has control of the Salar de Atacama mining operation in Chile, one of the largest in the world. The Chilean government is becoming more involved in the sector. It forced SQM to give up some operational and revenue rights. In exchange, SQM will have additional extraction capacity and operations through 2060, according to analysts.\n\nDespite having to deal with the government in this case, more mining capacity will be positive for SQM going forward. The miner trades at only 11x forward earnings and has seen its shares plummet by 45.2% over the past year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Trump Trade Resurgence: ETF Areas Set to Gain or Lose",
        "content": "The odds of former President Donald Trump returning to the White House have risen significantly following the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination. Investors now also anticipate the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September.\n\nAs a result, we have seen violent rotations in the market this week. Investors have bid up areas that might benefit from a second Trump presidency and dumped areas that may lose.\n\nTrump favors higher tariffs, particularly on imports from China. This could potentially hurt semiconductor stocks such as NVIDIA NVDA and Super Micro Computer SMCI. His comments on Taiwan have resulted in a broad sell-off in chip stocks today, driving the VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH down almost 7%.\n\nTrump prefers more deregulation, which could benefit the health insurance, energy, and financial industries as well as small-cap companies.\n\nProposed extensions of corporate and personal tax cuts could increase budget deficits and result in higher government borrowing. Consequently, longer-dated bond yields have surged lately.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s focus on green energy could take a back seat, and some of the subsidies could be eliminated. Solar and clean energy ETFs have plunged over the past weeks due to these concerns.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for oil companies and more drilling is likely to result in lower energy prices, which may not be positive for the energy sector.\n\nCryptocurrencies and related stocks have risen sharply in hopes of a more friendly administration. Trump is scheduled to speak at a crypto conference later this month. The iShares Bitcoin Trust: IBIT is up over 10% this week.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Tesla TSLA CEO Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement of Trump could result in a softening of Trump\u2019s stance toward electric vehicles. Tesla stock has been on a tear lately since the company reported better-than-feared second-quarter deliveries.\n\nIf EV purchase-tax credits are eliminated by the new administration, Tesla will sttill be in a much better position compared to its peers in the industry, according to some analysts.\n\nTo learn more, please watch the short video above.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Trump is starting to move markets",
        "content": "Donald Trump has had a surprisingly solid summer, raising the odds, for now, that he\u2019ll win a second presidential term.\n\nThat's why financial markets are reawakening to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d with varying implications for stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, interest rates, and inflation.\n\nTrump\u2019s upturn began with the June 27 presidential debate in which President Joe Biden\u2019s bumbling raised more questions than ever about the incumbent\u2019s age and stamina. Ever since, a swelling chorus of Democrats has been calling for Biden to withdraw and let Vice President Kamala Harris or another younger Democrat take on Trump.\n\nTrump survived a July 13 assassination attempt and appointed the first millennial to a national ticket by choosing J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running mate. Former Trump challengers lined up behind the former president at the Republican convention, an uncharacteristic show of unity in an otherwise fractious party.\n\nTrump himself seems to be steering to the center, perhaps in a bid to win swing voters and mainstream business backers. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, he sought to assuage Wall Street fears of chaos in a second term. He said he\u2019d probably keep Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the job through the end of his term in 2026, \u201cespecially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\u201d That means lowering interest rates, but only during a Trump presidency\u2014not in the fall, when it might help Biden.\n\nTrump tried to assure investors there would be no unusual inflation caused by new tariffs without explaining how he\u2019d work that magic. He even suggested he\u2019d consider JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary, which would put a Wall Street eminence in the job, should Dimon accept. Trump's Treasury Secretary? Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks to the Economic Club of New York. (REUTERS/Mike Segar) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nElection scenarios are now nudging earnings and inflation off the radar screen as top investor concerns. \u201c\u2018Animal spirits\u2019 have taken on a whole new head of steam because of this growing feeling that Donald Trump is going to emerge victorious,\u201d economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote to clients on July 17. \u201cNo wonder investors are foaming at the mouth.\u201d\n\nBetting markets \u2014 which can be spurious \u2014 now give Trump 66% odds of winning, according to the RealClearPolitics average. That suggests rising odds of not just a Trump win, but of a Republican sweep in which the GOP wins both houses of Congress too, giving it unified control of the government.\n\nThat would open the door to more corporate tax cuts, which Democrats would likely block if they controlled at least one chamber of Congress. Rosenberg views the GOP sweep scenario as a contributor to the recent investor rotation out of tech stocks into smaller companies deemed value stocks on the theory that more tax cuts would help smaller shares catch up in value to the so-called Magnificent Seven.\n\nStory continues\n\nCryptocurrencies have been another beneficiary of Trump\u2019s rising fortunes. Trump, once a crypto skeptic, now pledges to end government efforts to regulate crypto in a bid to capture younger voters smitten with the trend. The value of bitcoin jumped by $1,000 during the first hour after Trump survived the July 13 shooting as buyers bet the failed assassination would boost Trump\u2019s election odds. During the next four days, bitcoin rose by another $4,500. Most other cryptos followed bitcoin higher.\n\nBut the outlook for a second Trump presidency isn\u2019t entirely bullish.\n\nFor instance, Trump\u2019s plans to boost import tariffs and roust undocumented immigrants out of the country are both inflationary, since they would raise the prices of imported goods on their face and probably also boost labor costs by making workers in some industries more scarce.\n\nThat could undo the considerable progress of the last two years, with inflation falling sharply from its 2022 peak, prompting hope that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. Any sign of resurgent inflation \u2014 including possible Trump policies \u2014 could interfere with that and keep interest rates elevated. Some analysts think interest rates are already higher than they would otherwise be because investors are beginning to price in the effect of inflationary Trump policies.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nInvestors are also sniffing around for specific sectors or companies that could benefit or suffer under a second Trump term. During the Bloomberg interview, for instance, Trump suggested he wouldn\u2019t aid Taiwan if China attacked, even though Taiwan is a key source of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, which are fundamental to the US economy and to the artificial intelligence boom. Or, he said, Taiwan should pay the United States for its protection.\n\nTech stocks promptly sold off, leading to a 2.5% one-day drop in the Nasdaq stock index on July 17. \u201cSome of the pressure on big tech stocks today seems to be tied to [Trump] remarks that Taiwan should pay for US defense,\u201d Capital Economics explained on July 17, the day Bloomberg published the Trump interview. Shares of TSMC, Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor giant, fell by 7% on the news.\n\nThough he\u2019s having a good run, Trump is not a shoo-in.\n\nFor all of Biden\u2019s woes, he\u2019s less than three points behind Trump in the Cook Political Report polling average.\n\nAnd an already unpredictable race could get woolier still. Biden could still withdraw, with a less familiar Democrat taking his place. Trump is also due to be sentenced on 34 felony convictions in the New York City fraud trial on Sept. 18, just six weeks before the election. And both candidates are elderly and frail in their way, elevating the odds of a health emergency in the home stretch of the election.\n\nWhatever markets price in today they could price out tomorrow.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Tesla let a man sell his Cybertruck because it didn\u2019t fit in his garage",
        "content": "Tesla overturned its rule against customers reselling the Cybertruck in part because one of them couldn\u2019t fit the stainless steel tank into his apartment complex\u2019s parking garage.\n\nBlaine Raddon, a self-proclaimed Tesla superfan from Salt Lake City, was one of the first to reserve Tesla\u2019s newest vehicle, the New York Post reported. But just after he received the $100,000 electric truck, Raddon went through a divorce and moved from a house with an ample driveway to an apartment complex where he had to fit the 18-foot-by-8-foot long vehicle in a smaller parking space.\n\nYet, thanks to a \u201cvehicle order agreement\u201d specific to the Cybertruck, Raddon was also in a tight spot. He couldn\u2019t sell the truck within one year of delivery without incurring a $50,000 fine and a lifetime ban from buying Tesla products.\n\nRaddon took to X, controlled by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, to complain about the policy in a now-deleted post that soon gained traction online and caught the attention of news outlets. Finally, Tesla\u2019s team reached out to him, he told the New York Post.\n\n\u201cI got a call from the executive office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a response to the article, and she said, \u2018We changed those terms and conditions. You are free to sell your truck. We just haven\u2019t published it yet.\u2019 I made her send me an email, to make sure I had it in writing that I was okay to sell.\u201d\n\nRaddon finally sold his Cybertruck last month for $109,000 within a week of listing it. Thanks to the long waiting list to get a new one, he actually made a $2,000 profit. Despite the Cybertruck hiccup, the longtime Tesla admirer said he was replacing the electric pickup with a Tesla Model 3 Performance.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been to a gas station since 2005,\u201d Raddon told the New York Post. \u201cTeslas have been very, very good to me.\u201d\n\nNow that word of the policy change has spread, some Cybertruck owners are putting their vehicles up for sale, too. Online, some Cybertrucks can be found listed for up to $150,000, significantly more than what the 2024 model retails for.\n\nThe Cybertruck has faced other roadblocks since its release. Last month, the company issued two recalls affecting nearly all of the roughly 12,000 Cybertrucks out on roads over issues with the vehicle's windshield wiper and a piece of trim along the truck bed.\n\nReviewers have criticized the electric truck for its build quality and ability to operate offroad. Others, though, have praised its handling and the smoothness of its regenerative braking.\n\nSome of Tesla\u2019s most loyal supporters are looking forward to a new Cybertruck model, especially after Musk on Monday tweeted a cryptic image of the truck in a cyberpunk style photo with a rainy city backdrop.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Flying Car Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Flying car stocks have been explosive.\n\nLook at Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY), for example.\u00a0The last time I highlighted opportunity in the stock, it traded at about $5 on July 3.\n\nToday, it\u2019s up to $6.95 on news it successfully flew a first-of-its-kind hydrogen electric air taxi that ran about 523 miles, with water as its only byproduct. Even better, JOBY expects to start commercial operations of its battery-electric air taxi by 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that launch nearing, JOBY is a buy.\n\nFueling even more momentum is China, which has given flying car companies a green light for development.\u00a0According to\u00a0The Economist, Prime Minister Li Qiang mentioned the \u201clow altitude economy\u201d as a potential new engine for GDP growth.\u00a0Even better,\u00a0\u201cthe domestic market is now poised for an unprecedented boom,\u201d said eHang Holdings CEO Huazhi Hu in an earnings call.\n\nEven better, with the flying car boom just getting off the ground, JPMorgan predicts a potential $3 trillion market by 2040.\n\nAll of these could send flying car stocks sky-high. In addition to JOBY, here are three other hot flying car stocks to jump into today.\n\neHang Holdings (EH) An image of a lifesize white and black pilotable drone display in China with a man taking a picture of a woman in front of it.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nOn July 3, I also mentioned eHang Holdings (NASDAQ:EH), which traded at $14.12.\n\nToday, at $15.42, it\u2019s still a strong buy. Helping,\u00a0Morgan Stanley just upgraded the stock to an overweight rating with a $27.50 price target. Plus,\u00a0with China rolling out supportive policies for the low-altitude economy, \u201cthe domestic market is now poised for an unprecedented boom,\u201d said CEO Huazhi Hu, as I noted above.\n\nEven better, the company just received\u00a0certification for its EH216-S-passenger-carrying pilotless eVTOL aircraft from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. That now clears the way for the company to increase production and meet its backlog of orders.\n\nEarnings have been solid. The company posted a 178% increase in year-over-year revenue in its first quarter and positive operating cash flow for the second consecutive quarter.\u00a0\u00a0In late May, Xishan Tourism ordered 50 EHang EH216-S pilotless electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft from the company for about $15.6 million.\n\nXPeng (XPEV) Xpeng (XPEV) car dealership at night with white company logo on display above EVs\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Robert Way\n\nOn July 3, I also mentioned XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), which traded at $7.88.\n\nAt the time, I noted, \u201cIts X2 just took its first flight at the\u00a0Beijing Daxing International Airport. The\u00a0company also wants to commercialize flying cars by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nNow, at $8.40, XPEV is still a buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to XPeng affiliate\u00a0XPeng AeroHT, there are plans to start delivering flying cars to customers by 2026. And, according to company co-president Brian Gu, the cars should be available for pre-order this year, starting at $138,000 each.\n\nXPEV\u2019s upside is also being fueled by improving electric vehicle sales. In June, for example, the company said it delivered 10,668 Smart EVs, a 24% improvement year over year. For the first half of the year, it has now delivered 52,028 EVs, a 26% jump year over year.\n\nPlus, Citi analysts just raised their price target on XPEV to HK$32.20 from HK$29.90.

        "title": "Early Tesla Backer Debuts Funds Tied to Musk\u2019s xAI, SpaceX",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ron Baron, an early backer of Tesla Inc., is deepening his embrace of Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk by setting up partnerships that would permit clients to invest in two of the billionaire\u2019s private ventures.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown on China BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting HSBC Names Elhedery CEO, Picking Insider for Top Job Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\n\nBaron Capital Management formed a pair of funds in recent months to invest solely in Musk\u2019s xAI, the artificial intelligence startup that raised some $6 billion through a private stock sale earlier this year. Baron\u2019s firm also started a private partnership to buy more shares of Space Exploration Technologies, Musk\u2019s rocket and satellite company.\n\nSoaring demand for the limited supply of SpaceX and xAI shares has spawned a cottage industry in which Wall Street firms create single-purpose vehicles that charge stiff fees for the chance to invest in the company.\n\nThe Baron vehicles, on the other hand, are forgoing high compensation for a different sort of payoff: a wager that providing access to SpaceX and xAI will raise the firm\u2019s profile among family offices and private bank clients who might later invest in its mutual funds.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this because we want people to know about our mutual funds,\u201d Baron, 81, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI want my business to last for 100 years.\u201d\n\nMusk didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nIn April, a fund devoted to SpaceX called BaronX Cayman filed to raise money from offshore investors, a category that typically includes US tax-exempt institutions, such as pension plans and endowments.\n\nIn addition, newly formed BaronxAI is investing $130 million in Musk\u2019s AI venture through its May stock sale, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential details of the deal. A sister fund called BaronxAI Cayman has filed to raise money offshore.\n\nThese funds each charge an annual management fee of around 1% and lock up investor capital for about eight years, the person said; the fee falls by half should SpaceX or xAI become publicly traded. Rival single-purpose funds typically charge annual management fees of 1% to 2%, along with performance fees equaling as much as 20% of profits.\n\nUphill Battle\n\nThe money raised by the private partnerships could help offset outflows that Baron Capital\u2019s mutual funds have experienced since the start of 2022, said Adam Sabban, a senior analyst at Morningstar. Many other stock-picking funds are caught in the same bind, Sabban said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBecause of index funds taking over, pretty much every active equity shop is fighting an uphill battle at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nBaron Capital\u2019s mutual funds suffered net outflows totaling almost $7.2 billion from the beginning of 2022 through this May, according to Chicago-based Morningstar, though the bulk of these withdrawals were from the firm\u2019s Emerging Markets and Global Advantage funds, neither of which follow its core strategy. Baron Capital\u2019s assets total more than $40 billion, most of which is held in mutual funds.\n\nBaron, who started his firm in 1982 with $10 million in capital he managed for billionaire George Soros, is a holdout from a bygone money-management era, when mutual-fund stars such as Peter Lynch, Jeff Vinik and Bill Miller held sway on Wall Street because of their stock-picking skills.\n\nA former caddy at the famed Hollywood Golf Club in Deal, New Jersey, Baron holds some stocks for decades. One example is a stake in Charles Schwab Corp. dating back to 1992, the same year that his flagship Baron Partners Fund started up.\n\nAnother of his signature strategies is making outsize bets on chief executives he considers exceptional, such as casino magnate Steve Wynn. This approach led Baron Partners to begin buying Tesla shares in 2014, an investment that multiplied 20-fold in profit and ultimately had to be pared after it grew to equal roughly half of the fund\u2019s net assets at the end of 2021.\n\nBaron has also backed Musk and his companies in public, often by appearing on CNBC to vouch for Tesla and SpaceX as good investments. When Tesla was rallying support earlier this year for shareholders to re-approve a $56 billion pay package for Musk \u2013 it was initially nixed by a Delaware court \u2014 Baron leapt into the fracas by publishing an open letter urging his fellow investors to sign off on the compensation plan.\n\nHaving first met Musk in 2010, Baron began investing in Tesla four years later and then began doing research on SpaceX. This set the stage for his firm to begin investing in the company in 2017, before Tesla had started up its Starlink satellite internet service.\n\nHe already had some familiarity with the industry. While attending law school at night, Baron worked during the day for the US Patent and Trademark Office, where he was the examiner for patents on the coatings applied to rockets to prevent them from burning up when they re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nSpace Odyssey\n\nBaron\u2019s firm continued to invest in SpaceX through semi-annual offerings that the company arranges for employees who would like to sell some of their shares. To date, it has invested a little more than $1 billion in the space venture \u2014 including an onshore fund that holds SpaceX shares \u2014 building a 1.2% stake that\u2019s now valued at almost $2.8 billion.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s reusable rockets and Starlink satellite system, used by Ukraine in its effort to fend off the Russian invasion, have made it a huge draw for investors, even though it is closely held. The company received a valuation of $210 billion through an employee sale earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Baron Partners\u2019 fortunes remain closely tied to Tesla, as the fund continues to have about 29% of its assets invested in the car company, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has been on a tear lately, jumping 80% since late April.\n\nWhile the concentration has led to volatile returns for Baron Partners \u2013 it more than doubled in 2020 only to plummet 42% two years later \u2013 the fund has generated an average annual return of almost 16% since 2003, when it converted from its earlier status as a private partnership. This performance ranks Baron Partners as a top US equity fund since 2003, according to Morningstar.\n\n\u201cIf you have invested through this wild ride, you still came out ahead,\u201d Sabban at Morningstar said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "An Average American Would Need 3 Centuries To Match Tesla CEO's Yearly Paycheck",
        "content": "An Average American Would Need 3 Centuries To Match Tesla CEO's Yearly Paycheck\n\nElon Musk\u2019s 11-figure pay package, in contrast to millions of Americans struggling to keep up with inflation and make ends meet, is a stark reminder of American inequality. The decline of the middle class, as per Pew Research, is not mere speculation: In 1971, 61% of Americans lived in middle-class households, a figure that has now dropped by 10%.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAre you richer than most people you know? Here\u2019s the net worth you need at every age to be above average. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nWhat is a middle-class salary? You\u2019re middle class if your household earns between $39,296 and $118,800. That number is based on data from the Pew Research Center, which defines the middle class as households that earn between two-thirds and double the median U.S. household income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median household income in 2023 was approximately $59,400.\n\nAnother amazing contrast? While the average American earns $34 an hour, if Musk works 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, he\u2019s making $22.5 million an hour.\n\nWhen so many people tie their sense of worth or accomplishment to their career, it can leave nearly everyone wondering, \"What about me?\". The answer is clear: to amass Elon Musk-level wealth with an average salary, you\u2019ll need about 272 years, over 3.5 times the average U.S. life span.\n\nWhile Musk highlights the disparity, he\u2019s not alone. According to an AFL-CIO report, top CEOs of S&P 500 companies earn an all-time-high average of $16.7 million. The obvious conclusion is that CEO-to-worker pay ratios remain unacceptably high, creating an unhealthy work environment and failing to adequately reward a highly skilled, dedicated workforce. The report concludes that companies suffer from a winner-take-all philosophy; thus, everyone loses.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to Musk. Tesla had 140,473 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023. If Musk\u2019s pay package was reduced to just $1 billion \u2014 arguably, more than any human could ever need \u2014 the remaining $44 billion could be divided among its workforce and wider educational or nonprofit programs.\n\nIf $40 billion were divided equally among Tesla\u2019s employees, each person would earn an additional $284,752. It\u2019s not enough to make them billionaires but enough to live comfortably in the U.S. and put them in the top 10% of U.S. earners.\n\nStory continues\n\nOr Musk could offer one million $30,000 scholarships each year to new college students. And don\u2019t forget we\u2019re reserving $4 billion for nonprofit programs to improve society \u2014 from tackling climate change to medical research \u2014 so the company could show that it cares about everyone, not just its CEO.\n\nThe conclusion is that your worth is not tied to your earning potential. Still, the wider economy and success of society are tied to the average American earning a living wage, and that\u2019s harder than it was 50 years ago. The enormous pay disparity between top leaders and the average worker creates a call for action. If we want to keep the American dream alive, we must do more to provide access to everyone, not just the 1% of the 1%.\n\nAnd to those in the top 1% of earners: your privilege comes with a responsibility to give back, to take steps and risks that could benefit millions of people. You have the power to change the world \u2014 use it for the good of all.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?

        "title": "Wall Street is divided on Tesla's future under a second Trump presidency",
        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is throwing his support behind Donald Trump's presidential campaign, but a potential second term has left Wall Street split on whether it will be a boon or bust for the EV maker.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the Biden-era $7,500 EV tax incentive. The former president, his VP pick J.D. Vance, and a number of their Republican colleagues have long opposed Biden's EV initiatives. Senator Vance introduced the Drive American Act last fall, aimed at eliminating over $100 billion in existing EV subsidies and replacing them with credits for gas or diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nHowever, a rollback in EV credits could help Tesla (TSLA) \u201cwiden the gap and technology lead\u201d over its rivals, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives told me. The world's most valuable automaker is better positioned in an unsubsidized environment compared to younger EV companies that are burning through cash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big advantage for Tesla and Elon Musk,\u201d Ives said, adding that Tesla\u2019s scale and scope is \u201cunmatched.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone on Wall Street is buying the argument that a Trump presidency is a positive for Tesla.\n\nGuggenheim\u2019s Ron Jewsikow told me he \u201cstruggles\u201d to see it as anything but negative, calling the EV tax credit a \u201ckey affordability enabler\u201d for Tesla.\n\nJewsikow also noted the risk of higher tariffs, as Tesla, like other auto manufacturers, uses Chinese-sourced batteries.\n\nWall Street is closely tracking Musk\u2019s support for Trump. Musk, who endorsed Trump shortly after the failed assassination attempt on July 13, wrote in a post on X that Trump's vice president pick is an \"excellent decision,\" later adding that a Trump-Vance ticket \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nHe also reportedly plans to pledge $45 million per month to support the former president's White House bid.\n\nI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery pic.twitter.com/ZdxkF63EqF\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 13, 2024\n\nThroughout Trump\u2019s campaign, he has proposed implementing a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports, a move that would likely escalate the ongoing trade war. That\u2019s compared to the current administration\u2019s recent decision to raise the tariff rate to 25% for Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries and battery parts.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff talk has caught the attention of others on Wall Street as analysts weigh the implications of a Trump presidency on the automotive sector beyond Tesla.\n\nRBC\u2019s Tom Narayan told me Trump\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior during his first four years in office has left the auto industry uneasy, and many automakers view his past threats as a potential challenge to their business if he were to be elected for a second term.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIn 2019 he threatened to put tariffs on Canadian aluminum and that scared everybody, but he never wound up doing it. And then he threatened to put tariffs on Europe. It\u2019s the erratic nature of threats that the auto industry does not like,\u201d Narayan said. A variety of Tesla vehicles are stored at a shopping mall parking lot of a closed movie theater Friday, June 21, 2024, in Scottsdale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhile the exact impact of a Trump presidency on Tesla is still murky, there\u2019s growing consensus that a second term will likely slow EV adoption and hurt the sector overall.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't necessarily sink Tesla's ship, but it does sink some ships. It\u2019s certainly negative for everyone,\u201d Jewsikow said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ives. \u201cTrump would be negative for Detroit and the EV transformation of GM (GM) and Ford (F),\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a major headwind for core EV players not named Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe debate around the election's impact comes amid shifting sentiment toward Tesla. Better-than-expected second quarter deliveries prompted an 11-day rally in the stock before shares briefly sold off this week on reports of the company delaying its robotaxi unveiling to the fall.\n\nThe stock is up 40% since the start of June.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock increased significantly by 65% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Tesla's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Tesla\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tesla is:\n\n21% = US$14b \u00f7 US$65b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nTesla's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Tesla seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 62% seen over the past five years by Tesla. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Tesla's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 19%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Tesla's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Tesla Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Tesla doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Tesla's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "Stocks to Buy: 7 Founder-Led Companies Set to Outperform",
        "content": "What would you say if there was a reliable, evergreen indicator that a company will consistently out-innovate its competitors and, by extension, have a greater chance of long-term survival and market outperformance? While it may seem a pipe dream, research indicates that founder-led companies do just that, creating a unique set of parameters when looking for stocks to buy.\n\nA 2016 study found that \u201cthe innovations of founder CEO-managed firms create more financial value than the innovations of professional CEO-managed firms;\u201d in other words, when a company\u2019s founder is at the helm, the company is more likely to take the types of risk that companies must embrace if they\u2019re to maintain a competitive edge. Oftentimes, the managerial and professional CEO class is content to keep a company on the same trajectory, if not tweak operations solely for financial engineering purposes.\n\nJust look to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for proof positive of how professional CEOs can tank a company\u2019s value proposition: Sundar Pichai made his bones with consulting firm McKinsey, whose alumni are notorious for a focus on bean counting over innovation (and even product safety), before moving up Google\u2019s corporate ladder to his current position. Today, Google is derided for slipping search efficacy \u2014 not to mention falling behind in the race toward artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn contrast, these founder-led companies remain at the cutting edge of their respective industries. And, if history is any indication, these founder-led companies are also set to outperform most.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of today\u2019s top founder-led companies, the first name that likely pops up is Elon Musk. SpaceX, Neuralink, and, of course, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are just a few companies Musk founded and still runs today. And, even with the recent robotaxi delay drama, Tesla has plenty of upside in the near future.\n\nMany point to Tesla\u2019s recent sales slump as evidence supporting their bear thesis \u2014 whether poor product quality, Musk\u2019s perceived inherent risk factors, or just plain antagonism toward the stock. However, looking at Tesla sales as a standalone measure is a misguided metric. Fewer than 20% of new car buyers pay cash, instead preferring financing. Today, new car loan interest rates are bumping up against 9%. Considering these macro factors, is it any wonder Tesla is selling fewer cars? As rates stabilize and fall, expect consumers waiting for improved financing terms to flock to Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Tesla is rapidly reducing production costs, which will expand the company\u2019s market share as it can target budget-minded buyers with lower-priced vehicles. Factor in artificial intelligence, robotics and a range of profitable peripheral endeavors and it\u2019s clear that Musk and Tesla fit the founder-led companies paradigm to a T.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf Tesla wasn\u2019t enough to hammer home the strength in founder-led companies, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) should do the trick. Founded more than 30 years ago by Jensen Huang, Huang\u2019s long-term outlook, patience, and willingness to identify and innovate toward emerging tech trends \u2014 artificial intelligence in particular \u2014 benefited shareholders and customers alike.\n\nI don\u2019t need to rehash Nvidia\u2019s shocking performance over the past two years, nor the catalysts, but instead want to look at Huang\u2019s unique approach to management and steering the company forward. Huang emphasizes his humble beginnings often, pointing to time spent bussing tables as a teenager as a major contributor to today\u2019s work ethic and willingness to dive into the dirty details to make sure products and processes are on point.\n\nMoreover, Huang isn\u2019t content to rest on his laurels like so much of the professional-managerial CEO class \u2014 he\u2019s actively looking to \u201cfutureproof\u201d Nvidia in a bid to protect his current empire and help it adapt and evolve with the times. This commitment to excellence and, more importantly, a long-term view of things is rare in a market more focused on quarter-to-quarter outcomes than multi-year game plans. That\u2019s yet another reason to fall back on founder-led companies.\n\nFigs (FIGS) Person holding smartphone with logo of US healthcare apparel company Figs Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFigs (NYSE:FIGS) faced a particularly trying few years after peaking at nearly $50 per share following its 2021 IPO, only to drop to around $6 per share today. But the drastic per-share price dip conceals a major advantage that could reverse its fortune. Figs counts itself among founder-led companies, created in 2013 and jointly run by the founders Heather Hasson and Trina Spear today, but also facing near-inevitable market share dominance.\n\nFigs makes higher-end uniforms for healthcare professionals, essentially trying to do for scrubs what Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU). However, the company faced stiff competition from the nation\u2019s largest scrubs company, Careismatic Brands, which dominates as much as half of the overall market. But Careismatic fell on hard times and just emerged from bankruptcy proceedings last month. Successfully navigating bankruptcy comes with a price \u2014 which is already apparent after the company laid off staff and closed distribution centers in May.\n\nThis shakeup, of course, works to Figs\u2019 benefit: The company is primed to snatch up market share from Careismatic. One interview with Spear highlighted the unique approach to targeting its total addressable market (TAM) that typifies founder-led companies, as she said \u201clazy companies sell into TAM, and innovative companies create TAM.\u201d Careismatic\u2019s stumbles may end up creating the biggest TAM of all for Figs moving forward.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew have as close a bead on the wider biotech market as scientists involved in the industry, making Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) unique among founder-led companies. Led today by co-founders George Yancopoulos and Leonard Schleifer, the CEO and president/chief science officer, respectively. Regeneron is also unique among biotech stocks in its relative stability in a volatile sector. In fact, its beta is just 0.13, which is shockingly low for any stock \u2014 let alone one in the biotech field.\n\nOne of Regeneron\u2019s recent successes is the August 2023 FDA approval for a high-dosage version of its eye disease treatment, Eylea. This approval strengthens Regeneron\u2019s competitive position and helps mitigate the impact of Medicare price negotiations on the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s future also looks promising due to its other therapeutics, especially Dupixent. Initially used to treat asthma and eczema, Dupixent is now in Phase 3 trials for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Early results are promising, showing a 34% reduction in symptoms. Given Dupixent\u2019s current success, analysts project that expanding its use to COPD could drive sales to $20 billion annually.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs with biotech, few understand cybersecurity\u2019s nuances as techies. Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of those high-end cybersecurity firms that also meets the parameters of founder-led companies, run today by co-founder George Kurtz.\n\nTo that end, businesses today face myriad challenges, from geopolitical conflicts and natural disasters to supply chain disruptions. However, regardless of size, cyber threats remain the top global risk for most business owners. Concerns about cyber attacks, data breaches, digital infrastructure vulnerabilities, and ransomware are paramount.\n\nCrowdstrike is uniquely positioned to tackle these escalating threats, even beyond its status among founder-led companies. As technological advancements demand more robust security measures, Crowdstrike\u2019s comprehensive solutions are lynchpins to company success, making switching costs too steep for most firms and further entrenching its market share positioning. The company already boasts a diverse clientele, including government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s impressive financial performance reinforces the founder-led company thesis. The company has seen significant revenue growth over the past five quarters, with the last four marking its first consecutive profitable periods. These steady income increases, especially in the current economic climate, indicate a promising future for Crowdstrike as it continues to dominate the digital security landscape.\n\nOn Holding (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Holding (NYSE:ONON) is doing what competitors like Allbirds (NASDAQ:BIRD) and even Nike (NYSE:NKE) simply can\u2019t these days: adapting to changing consumer trends while maintaining a sufficiently high price point and popularity to keep margins high. All three co-founders also have executive positions in the company today, making On Holding one of the top founder-led companies to watch.\n\nMost interestingly, On\u2019s apparel segment sales climbed 25% in the company\u2019s first-quarter report, yet apparel makes up less than 4% of total sales. On is still a relatively new shoe brand and, on its current trajectory, will likely rapidly expand its apparel segment to more closely match shoe sales and ultimately boost top and bottom-line numbers. By comparison, Nike\u2019s apparel segment comprised more than 25% of total sales. So, by using Nike as a basis for comparison, On Holding has plenty of room to grow peripheral sales streams even as it expands its current 8% share of the US market. To the latter point, On owns 40% of the running shoe market in its home country, Switzerland, creating a blueprint for further US penetration.\n\nHyatt Hotels (H) Hyatt Hotels (H) building with logo in front of shrubbery\n\nSource: EQRoy/Shutterstock.com\n\nHyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) is a bit of an outlier on this list of founder-led companies. The brand\u2019s first hotel opened in 1954, and Jay Pritzker brought the soon-to-be chain and rapidly turned it into an international brand. Though Jay Pritzker passed in 1999, management has kept it in the family \u2014 with Jay\u2019s son, Thomas Pritzker, acting as executive chairman today. Hotel stocks are already seeing a resurgence if travel ETF AdvisorShares Hotel ETF (NYSEARCA:BEDZ) is any indication. Likewise, Hyatt, in particular, is set to rebound rapidly, as evidenced by its 20% gain since January.\n\nHyatt holds less than 10% of the global hotel market share, eclipsed by competitors like Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) at 30%, luxury and destination brand Loews Hotels (NYSE:L) at 20%, and even Hilton (NYSE:HLT) at 13%. But that will likely change soon, as Hyatt has more than 125,000 new rooms in its development pipeline or a 40% increase over current availability. The rapid expansion of this type in a relatively constrained economy is nearly unheard of, let alone for a cyclical industry like hotels and travel \u2014 but Hyatt is bucking the wider trend in a bid to bounce back faster than competitors as wider macro conditions improve.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in FIGS.

        "title": "Growth vs. GARP: Value Investors Should Buy Nio Stock Now",
        "content": "Given Nio\u2019s (NASDAQ:NIO) strong, recent growth, the low valuation of NIO stock and the high potential for its upcoming electric vehicles, I view its shares as a buy for value and growth-at-a-reasonable price (GARP) investors alike. Also likely to help the China-based automaker going forward are cost reductions spurred by its increasing utilization of robotics and Wall Street\u2019s renewed respect for EVs.\n\nStrong Growth and a Bargain Valuation\n\nLast month, Nio\u2019s deliveries soared 98% versus the same period a year earlier to 21,209. And in the second quarter, the automaker handed over 57,373 EVs, representing a huge 144% jump versus Q2 of 2023. Both the monthly and quarterly delivery figures set new, all-time records for the EV maker. Clearly, the company\u2019s EVs have become significantly more popular in China recently as its growth is trending way above the 31% delivery increase that it managed to generate in 2023. According to Seeking Alpha columnist Yiannis Zourmpanos, Nio\u2019s recent success is due to an increased focus on selling relatively affordable EVs.\n\nAfter NIO stock plunged 49% in 2024, the shares\u2019 valuation is quite low. Specifically, the name has a very low price-to-sales ratio of 1.15 times.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUpcoming EVs Have Great Potential\n\nNio\u2019s upcoming Onvo L60 EV looks poised to take significant market share from Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y in China.\n\nThe Onvo L60, which is expected to hit the market in September, looks similar to the Model Y in pictures, and it offers similar driving ranges to Tesla\u2019s iconic EV. However, the Onvo 360 starts at just $30,500 in China while the most affordable Model Y model has a sticker price of $34,600.\n\nAlso importantly, Nio intends to launch a large SUV in 2025 that will seat six or seven passengers. In general, there are not many large electric SUVs on the market. As a result, I believe that such EVs can easily generate a great deal of demand among consumers. Indeed, six months after Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) launched its own large X9 SUV, the firm delivered an average of 2,200 of the vehicles each month. That represents about 20% of its total deliveries. Moreover, large SUVs tend to carry relatively high profit margins for automakers.\n\nDeutsche Bank is very upbeat on the Onvo 360\u2019s outlook, estimating that Nio can deliver 20,000 of the EVs per month. What\u2019s more, the bank expects Nio\u2019s deliveries to climb 62% in 2025. Coming on top of this year\u2019s very strong growth, such an increase would be very good for NIO stock.\n\nCost Cutting and the Street\u2019s Increased Bullishness\n\nNio is actively training humanoid robots and robot dogs to carry out inspections of its EVs. More importantly. the automaker is already utilizing 310 automated guided vehicle transport robots and 941 industrial robots in its assembly workshop. The automaker\u2019s intense utilization of robots has likely greatly reduced its costs and probably significantly contributed to the year-over-year tripling of its gross margin to nearly 5% in Q1. As the company increases its use of robotics, its costs are likely to fall further over the medium-and-long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso likely to boost NIO stock is Wall Street\u2019s recently increased optimism about EVs. In general, I\u2019ve found that the Street\u2019s view of Chinese companies within a given sector is highly influenced by the same sector\u2019s performance in America. For example, because many U.S. solar-power firms have struggled in recent years, large American investors have generally avoided Chinese solar stocks as well, even though Chinese solar companies have generally done relatively well during that period.\n\nFor the last year, the Street has been very bearish on EVs. However, that mindset has seemed to change after U.S. EV sales climbed 11% in Q2 versus the same period a year earlier. Indeed, NIO stock has advanced nearly 10% this month in the wake of the release of last quarter\u2019s U.S. EV sales data.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nio Stock\n\nGiven Nio\u2019s lack of strong technological advantages over its peers, I don\u2019t expect it to deliver tremendous growth over the long term. However, for value investors and GARP investors, it is worth buying at this point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in XPEV.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy Now in Hopes of a September Rate Cut",
        "content": "Inflation unexpectedly eased in June, providing the Federal Reserve with positive data as it approaches interest rate cuts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 3% annual price increase, down from 3.3% in May, with a 0.1% monthly decline. Core inflation rose 3.3%, the lowest since April 2021. Many notable economists have noted these results are extremely positive for those in the rate cut camp.\n\nNow that the market expects rate cuts to happen on September, consumers are looking for more ways to invest in stocks that benefits from it. One option to consider are electric vehicle (EV) stocks, since this space is interest rate sensitive.\n\nStill, investors must consider headwinds. The E.U. recently imposed tariffs on Chinese EV exports to counter competitive advantages from state subsidies. China is aggressively targeting EV growth, with new energy vehicles making up 46.7% of vehicle sales in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNevertheless, in June, manufacturers reported record deliveries, contributing to a 32% market share in 2023. The goal is to reach 40% by 2030 and 50% by 2035, supporting carbon neutrality by 2060. Tax exemptions further lower the cost of EV ownership by eliminating a 10% purchase tax.\n\nThese three EV stocks reported strong deliveries this quarter, despite a downturn in demand leading to price cuts. This has sparked a price war, squeezing profit margins across the sector. But if interest rate cuts do materialize, and costs come down for buyers, prices could feasibly rise as demand picks up.\n\nNio (NIO) ONVO brand logo on website. Chinese EV brand owned by Nio. NIO stock\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese EV company Nio (NYSE:NIO) reported strong deliveries in June, reflecting a 98% increase year-over-year (YOY). In Q2 of 2024, total deliveries reached 57,373, amounting to whopping 143.9% growth. This performance underscores Nio\u2019s expanding influence in the EV market.\n\nRecently, Nio launched the Banyan 2.6.5 CN system on July 11, featuring artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized automatic emergency braking (AEB). The upgrade aims to improve the car\u2019s ability to avoid obstacles on the road. It\u2019s the first AEB system using end-to-end technology, enhancing collision risk reduction by learning from human driving patterns.\n\nUnlike traditional rule-based systems, end-to-end technology uses AI to address scenarios not covered by existing rules. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) introduced FSD V12 earlier this year, yielding positive results and promoting this approach as an industry standard. Following suit, Nio reorganized its smart driving team on June 19 to prioritize end-to-end technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese EV leader Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is undervalued despite its dominance. A key advantage is its EVs\u2019 extended range, enhancing accessibility away from chargers. The company plans to invest 6 billion yuan in 5,000 new charging stations, diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams over the long-term. Additionally, Li also recently launched the Li L6, adding to its lineup of innovative EV models.\n\nLI stock has sharply corrected and is nearing 52-week lows, presenting a prime buying opportunity. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.4-times, this stock does appear to be significantly undervalued. The drop is primarily due to lowered growth estimates and EU tariffs on Chinese EVs.\n\nHowever, Li Auto remains focused on the Chinese market and ended Q1 with a strong cash reserve of $13.7 billion, allowing for investment in technology and development. The company aims to launch level three self-driving technology by 2025 and may expand into the Middle East.\n\nFinancially robust, with revenues reaching $17.4 billion last year, growing 173%, and sustaining profitability, Li Auto\u2019s potential exceeds its current $22 billion valuation.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California.

More than 40% of EV owners plan to switch to traditional vehicles, highlighting the need for investor awareness. Edmunds\u2019 latest EV tests provide valuable insights, including positive news for Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) investors.\n\nRivian\u2019s stock price target was raised from $11 to $15 by Mizuho, maintaining a neutral stance on RIVN stock. This followed Rivian\u2019s second-quarter vehicle deliveries of about 13,800, a 9% YOY increase, surpassing expectations of 11,500. Also, the company aimed for a 20% material cost reduction on its R1 model by Q4 and reaffirmed its 2024 delivery outlook, predicting low single-digit growth, below the 6% consensus.\n\nIn other positive news, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) recently partnered with Rivian, investing up to $5 billion to develop next-gen software-defined vehicle platforms. This collaboration aims to enhance technology and reduce costs, benefiting both companies. Facing significant losses, Rivian seeks financial support to scale production and invest in future products, with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) RJ Scaringe highlighting the partnership\u2019s role in securing capital for growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In 2024, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock and many of its early-stage EV peers struggled, with some hitting record lows.\n\nIndeed, industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also lagged until recently. However, Tesla rebounded and is now performing well, while RIVN stock has more than doubled from its lows.\n\nThis move has been driven by a key $5 billion strategic partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, Rivian\u2019s Q2 deliveries surpassed expectations, and the company reaffirmed its 2024 production target of 57,000 vehicles. This news was clearly positively received by investors amid industry turmoil. With valuations at low levels, Rivian\u2019s stock reacted strongly to these positive developments.\n\nHowever, investors largely remain cautious around Rivian\u2019s future prospects for continued growth in 2024.\n\nAfter all, this is a company that has continued to see big operational and production-related challenges. Let\u2019s dive into what to make of the recent impressive move in RIVN stock.\n\nMizuho Raises RIVN Stock Price Target\n\nRivian Automotive closed the week up 10%, surpassing $18, after Mizuho raised its price target to $15.\n\nRivian stock closed above $17 per share in recent days, despite Mizuho\u2019s $15 price target and neutral rating. That\u2019s an impressive move from the stock\u2019s low around $8 per share seen recently.\n\nAnalyst Vijay Rakesh highlighted a 9% year-over-year delivery increase, reaching about 13,800 EVs, surpassing forecasts and reducing inventory significantly.\n\nRivian\u2019s strong sales and Volkswagen\u2019s $5 billion investment improved its cash flow outlook. While still unprofitable, Rivian\u2019s balance sheet strengthened, reducing liquidity risks.\n\nThe company is now positioned to potentially become a profitable EV manufacturer, giving shareholders reason for optimism.\n\nImpressive R1T Performance\n\nAmid slowing U.S. EV sales growth, consumer sentiment is crucial. Over 40% of EV owners plan to switch to combustion-engine vehicles. Investors should note Edmunds\u2019 recent EV tests, which revealed positive insights for Rivian Automotive.\n\nEdmunds tested nine EVs in real-world conditions, and the Rivian R1T stood out positively. It impressed testers, many of whom would buy it again, providing good news for Rivian investors amid concerns about consumer shifts to gasoline vehicles.\n\nEdmunds praised the 2022 Rivian R1T for its real-world performance. Rivian also updated the vehicle with hardware and software improvements while launching new premium trims.\n\nThese enhancements aim to boost margins and profitability, even with flat delivery expectations. With the refreshed R1 ready, Rivian is now focused on producing the affordable R2 models, crucial for its future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nI\u2019m Still Cautious on RIVN Stock\n\nRivian Automotive initially focused on sports cars but shifted to electric trucks and SUVs in 2015. After acquiring Mitsubishi\u2019s plant in Illinois in 2017, Rivian faced challenges in the ongoing EV slump, yet its luxury market focus yielded mixed results.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s recent partnership with Volkswagen and other key performance reports certainly improves the company\u2019s outlook, the reality is that Rivian has plenty of headwinds to battle to provide meaningful long-term upside for investors.\n\nUntil production issues are sorted out, this is a company I\u2019m going to remain on the sidelines with. Of course, that could change over time, and the company is making strides in the right direction. But for now, I think being safe is better than being sorry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some \u201cprofit taking\u201d and invest in names that can benefit \u201cmore\u201d from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Has More Upside Potential?\n\nCopyright: wolandmaster / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nKing Lip\u2019s portfolio also features Tesla.\n\nTesla shares recently plunged after the company postponed its much-awaited robo taxi event until October. However, Tesla bulls say their core thesis remains unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nCathie Wood recently set a $2600 price target on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) for 2029, which present a whopping 1300% upside potential from the current levels. Wood thinks the robo taxi project has the potential to deliver $8 to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nHowever, many believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) won\u2019t be able to live up to the hype around its robo taxi plans. Each robo taxi is expected to have a price target of around $150K to $200K, with some estimates suggesting Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) would need about $35 billion to develop a global feet of such cars. Amid inflation and lack of preference for electric cars, American families will probably stay away from spending a fortune on robo taxis, which could cause a blow to Tesla Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans in the future.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. In our view, Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results, where revenues and earnings missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Weaker-than-expected automotive revenues were partly driven by a reduced average selling price, which was down 15% year-over-year. Moreover, management decided to forgo providing volume guidance, though they did acknowledge they are in a lower growth phase given the uncertain consumer environment particularly as it relates to high ticket purchases.\u201d\n\nOverall, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 180% and 930%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Nvidia has benefited so profoundly from artificial intelligence (AI), both in terms of its share price appreciation and financial performance, that Goldman Sachs says the chipmaker alone has defined the first phase of the nascent AI boom.\n\nHowever, AI tailwinds will eventually penetrate every sector and industry, and Goldman believes software and IT services companies may be best positioned to benefit in the long run. In line with that thinking, certain analysts see significant upside in UiPath (NYSE: PATH) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nKeith Weiss at Morgan Stanley has outlined a bull-case scenario in which UiPath trades at $35 per share by May 2025. That implies 180% upside from its current share price of $12.50. Ark Invest analysts led by Tasha Keeney recently published a valuation model that prices Tesla at $2,600 per share by 2029. That implies 930% upside from its current share price of $252.50.\n\nInvestors should never put too much confidence in price targets, especially when those price targets seem too good to be true. But UiPath and Tesla still warrant further consideration.\n\nUiPath: 180% implied upside\n\nUiPath specializes in robotic process automation (RPA), one of the fastest-growing software markets. Its business automation platform includes task mining and process mining tools that help users identify situations in which automation would be beneficial. And it includes development tools that help users build software robots to automate those tasks and processes.\n\nAdditionally, UiPath has incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities like computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning into its platform. For instance, its Document Understanding product uses RPA and AI to extract, interpret, and take action on data from documents. Its Communications Mining product brings the same functionality to conversational channels like email and social media, such that businesses can automate certain customer interactions.\n\nMorgan Stanley says UiPath is the \"clear category defining leader\" in RPA software. But analysts have also acknowledged the company in other areas. For instance, Forrester Research recently recognized UiPath as a leading document mining and analytics platform, the International Data Corp. (IDC) recognized its leadership in intelligent document processing software, and Everest Group named the company a leader in process mining software.\n\nUiPath reported better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 2024). Revenue increased 16% to $335 million and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased 18% to $0.13 per diluted share. However, management lowered full-year guidance, such that revenue is now projected to increase no more than 8%, citing inconsistent sales execution and a difficult macroeconomic environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock plunged 35% after management shared its gloomy outlook, and shares recently tumbled another 7% when the company announced a 10% reduction in its workforce. But investors have reason to be cautiously optimistic. Cofounder Daniel Dines has reassumed his previous role as CEO to refocus the company during this challenging period, and the workforce reduction could improve operational efficiency.\n\nWall Street expects UiPath to grow sales at 11% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027), but that estimate leaves a lot of room for upside. Not only is UiPath the leader in RPA software, a market forecast to grow at 40% annually through 2030, but investments in AI product development have garnered praise from industry observers.\n\nAdmittedly, UiPath is a risky investment. Not only are the odds of near-term triple-digit returns near zero, but the stock could continue falling if sales execution fails to improve under CEO Daniel Dines. However, with shares trading at 5.2 times sales, near the cheapest valuation in history, I think patient investors should consider buying a small position today.\n\nTesla: 930% implied upside\n\nTesla is the global leader in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales, with 17.2% market share year to date through May. However, that figure declined 4% from the same period last year. Meanwhile, its closest competitor, Chinese automaker BYD, accounted for 16% of BEV sales, and its market share only slipped 0.2%, according to EV Volumes.\n\nArk's valuation model is predicated on Tesla effectively monetizing its full self-driving software (FSD) in the coming years, both directly with subscription fees and indirectly through robotaxi services. Those products may sound farfetched to some readers, but autonomous driving technology is an inevitable extension of the artificial intelligence boom, and Tesla is well positioned to be a leader.\n\nSpecifically, the company has a material data advantage where FSD is concerned, simply because it has so many sensor-equipped vehicles on the road continuously gathering information. In fact, Tesla is collecting data 110 times faster than Alphabet subsidiary Waymo, and its FSD software is about 16 times safer than the average driver as measured by miles per crash on surface streets, according to Ark Invest.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has also expressed confidence that Tesla can successfully pivot from a capital-heavy auto manufacturer to a capital-light software and services provider. In fact, he believes mobility services (robotaxis) and network software/services (FSD, supercharging, premium connectivity) will eventually create a $10 trillion addressable market.\n\nHowever, Jonas sees that evolution playing out over a longer time horizon than Ark Invest. \"While we believe Tesla has many attributes that can make it a formidable player (if not an outright winner) in the race to autonomy, we believe the more material commercial scaling of the business would be well beyond 2030,\" Jonas wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nTesla is a tricky case because the investment thesis depends on nascent or even nonexistent products, which makes it difficult to predict future revenue and earnings. For instance, Ark expects revenue growth of roughly 55% annually through 2029, but the consensus estimate among Wall Street analysts calls for revenue growth of 15% annually through 2026.\n\nPersonally, I think the probability of a 930% return by 2029 is close to zero, but I also believe Tesla can evolve into a software and services business. Investors who agree with me should consider buying a few shares today. But I would keep my purchase very small. Shares currently trade at 9.3 times sales, a slight premium to the two-year average of 8.7 times sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

Investors are shifting away from valuing Tesla purely as an electric vehicle maker, pricing in some of the autonomous taxi potential, she told Bloomberg Television\u2019s David Ingles and Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Rebecca Sin in the Tiger Money podcast.\n\n\u201cAutonomous taxi platforms are the biggest AI project evolving today,\u201d she said, adding Ark has primarily based its Tesla valuation on its autonomous driving potential. \u201cIf we are right, the stock has miles to go.\u201d\n\nListen to our new Bloomberg podcast Tiger Money, available inside the terminal, Apple, Spotify\n\nWood\u2019s comments came after Tesla\u2019s share prices slumped nearly 43% this year through April 22, as electric vehicle sales slowed globally. A rebound in the last two months has erased most of the losses, though it\u2019s still underperformed former Magnificent Seven technology peers by wide margins.\n\nWood has been bullish on Tesla for a long time, making it a top holding in her Ark Innovation ETF. The fund has lost nearly 9% this year, while assets slumped about a third, partly due to redemptions. That compares with an 18% gain in the S&P 500 Index. Wood is known for making outsized predictions, including her call that Bitcoin would reach as much as $1.48 million by 2030.\n\nAutonomous taxi networks will be a \u201cwinner-takes-most\u201d opportunity, where the provider that can get passengers from point A to point B in the safest and quickest fashion will clinch the lion\u2019s share of business, Wood said. The network provider will be able to take a 30% to 50% share of revenue generated by fleet owners on its platform, giving it \u201ca recurring revenue with explosive cash flows\u201d as well as a profit margin north of 50%, she added. That departs from the build and sell, or \u201cone and done\u201d business model of making vehicles.\n\n\u201cThat is what we think people are missing: the size of the opportunity, how quickly it\u2019s going to scale, and how profitable it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said, adding she expects Tesla to lead the US market.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s weighting in the $6.5 billion ARK Innovation ETF Fund surpassed 15% last week. Ark doesn\u2019t usually add to a position once its weight in the portfolio hits 10%, Wood said. While a holding may drift higher from share appreciation, the firm would usually start selling well before it hits Tesla\u2019s levels.\n\nThe asset manager has taken some profits on Tesla but has permitted it to surge beyond the normal ceiling, believing Elon Musk\u2019s company is on the cusp of sharing a lot more information on its robotaxi project, she said.\n\nTesla delayed its planned robotaxi unveiling by two months to October to allow teams more time to build additional prototypes, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The news sent the stock down 8.4%, the steepest one-day drop since January. Wood is unfazed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably getting closer to this robotaxi opportunity, not further away,\u201d she said. Musk \u201cwants to show us something more awe-inspiring than we might have seen on Aug. 8. And he believes it\u2019s possible by October.\u201d\n\nTesla doesn\u2019t yet have regulatory approval to put driverless cars on the road, and its vehicles still aren\u2019t capable of safely maneuvering without constant human supervision. However, many investors believe it will eventually bring the technology to market and have bid the stock up alongside Musk\u2019s increasingly bullish claims.\n\nArk\u2019s valuation model hasn\u2019t taken into account much of Tesla\u2019s potential in China or in the humanoid robot and energy storage space. Musk in April won in-principle approval from Chinese officials to deploy its driver-assistance system into the world\u2019s biggest auto market, after reaching a mapping and navigation pact with Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc. and meeting requirements for data-security and privacy protection.\n\nAs the autonomous trend spreads across the transportation industry, autonomous trucks could undercut railway in pricing and provide point-to-point services, she said. The railway systems favored by veteran investor Warren Buffett may be \u201cstuck with stranded assets,\u201d she added.\n\nWood continued to cast doubts on Nvidia Corp.\u2019s gravity-defying valuations. Ark bought the AI-focused chipmaker at $4 in 2014 and held it until it approached $40 on a split-adjusted basis. It sold most of its stake before the stunning rally since last year.\n\nInvestors who catapulted the stock to the current height haven\u2019t baked in the amount of time it will take businesses to figure out how to adopt the transformational AI technology. \u201cIt is simply, in our view, too much, too soon,\u201d Wood said.\n\nMarket Concentration\n\nInvestors have been piling into the Magnificent Six, driving stock market concentration to a level higher than that of 1932, she said. Back then, investors flocked to mega stocks such as AT&T Inc., whose huge cash cushions and free cash flow were seen as boosting their chances of survival after the Great Depression. The four ensuing years instead saw smaller companies outperform.\n\nSimilarly, higher interest rates have driven investors toward the Magnificent Six for their massive cash positions and in part for their AI-propelled revenue growth. Investors\u2019 risk appetite will broaden to other stocks with disruptive technologies as interest rates fall.\n\n\u201cNow would be the wrong time to sell our strategy,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWe believe interest rates are going to come down and going to come down more dramatically than most people think.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Rebecca Sin and David Ingles.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy How Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Elon Musk weighed in Monday on Tesla\u2019s event introducing the robotaxi getting moved back.\n\nTesla has previously indicated the event, highly-anticipated among investors, would involve showing its purpose-built Cybercab and providing other details of its autonomous robotaxi plans.\n\nTESLA'S 2ND QUARTER DELIVERIES BETTER THAN EXPECTED\n\nUnnamed sources told Bloomberg newly requested design alterations and prototype production drove Tesla\u2019s decision to put off the unveiling. It could instead take place in October, according to the report.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIn an X post on July 13, the day Tesla held its 2024 annual stockholder meeting, the EV maker teased \"more details\" on the robotaxi would come \"later this summer\" without specifying a date. Tesla has previously indicated the event, highly-anticipated among investors, would involve showing its purpose-built Cybercab and providing other details of its autonomous robotaxi plans.\n\nThat post featured a photo of what appeared to be the \"summon\" button for a ride-hailing function that Tesla said in April would eventually be incorporated into the company\u2019s app.\n\nTESLA HAS AUTONOMOUS RIDE-HAILING SERVICE IN PIPELINE: WHAT TO KNOW\n\n\"There will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet,\" Musk said of Tesla\u2019s envisioned autonomous ride-hailing service in April while participating in the EV maker\u2019s first-quarter earnings call. \"There will be some number of cars, and then there will be a bunch of cars where they\u2019re owned by the end user.\" Newly requested design alterations and prototype production reportedly drove Tesla\u2019s decision to put off the unveiling.\n\nThe users would have the ability to \"add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want\" and \"decide if they want to only let the car be used by friends and family, or only by 5-star users, or by anyone at any time\" before calling it back to them for personal use, Musk explained at the time.\n\nMUSK DISHES ON TALKS WITH TRUMP DURING TESLA SHAREHOLDER MEETING\n\nThe purpose-built Cybercab is slated to use a \"revolutionary \u2018unboxed\u2019 manufacturing strategy,\" according to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter shareholder presentation.\n\nOnce it ultimately makes its debut, Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service would presumably compete with ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.\n\nMusk and Tesla have both said they believe the world is \"headed for\" an \"electric\" and \"autonomous future.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOriginal article source:Elon Musk said Tesla moved robotaxi event 'for important design change'\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump is not shy about his contempt for electric vehicles.\n\nThe Republican nominee\u2019s choice words for the industry are often extremely hyperbolic: He has said that electric cars will \u201ckill\u201d America\u2019s auto industry, and lead to an \u201cassassination\u201d of jobs.\u00a0 Electric car supporters are \u201cthugs,\u201d Trump declared in a post on Truth Social last Christmas. (\u201cMay they rot in hell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAgain, Merry Christmas!\u201d)\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s EV promotion will lead to an auto industry \u201cbloodbath,\u201d Trump said during a March campaign rally. In the same speech, he claimed he would slap a \u201c100% tariff\u201d on electric vehicles made in Mexico but imported to the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to sell those cars,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo months later, Trump offered a deal to oil executives: raise $1 billion for his re-election campaign, and he\u2019ll roll back all of Biden\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d electric vehicle-promoting policies.\n\nThe oil executives balked at the deal\u2019s transactional nature. But, the CEO of Tesla, the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle company, has reportedly tapped on Trump\u2019s shoulder and offered a $180 million olive branch.\n\nWhat will Elon Musk receive in return for potentially the largest financial commitment in this election cycle?\n\nSo far, slightly \u201cquieted\u201d rhetoric on electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cElon's out there funding SuperPACs and telling donors to give money to Trump, and so Trump, in his kind of calculating, says, 'Well, I better lay off the EV stuff,'\u201d Michael Murphy, a Republican strategist and CEO of the EV Politics Project, toldFortune. \u201cTrump is maybe turning the corner a little on the anti-EV rhetoric. And I'll give Elon credit for that.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s shift to the right\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Musk\u2019s $45 million-a-month commitment comes after years of a political shift for the controlling shareholder of X, who is also co-founder of SpaceX and Neuralink, and leader of a new venture, xAI. Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nWhile Musk used to be a Democrat-leaning, mostly neutral centrist, he has increasingly criticized Biden on many topics, including immigration, DEI, and what he calls appeals to \u201cwokism.\u201d On his platform, X, formerly Twitter, he frequently makes fun of the left, re-posting memes about pronouns, President Biden\u2019s age, and other thorns in Democrats\u2019 sides.\n\nThe feelings are reciprocated: Musk is much less trusted and liked among Democrats, according to Shahar Silbershatz, the CEO of reputational management firm Caliber.\n\n\u201cBased on our data from the Tech CEO study we ran in December 2023, and on our ongoing reputation tracker of Tesla in the U.S.,\u201d Silbershatz told Fortune, \u201c[Musk] gets a Trust & Like Score \u2026 of 63 among [Republicans], and 36 among [Democrats], on a 0-100 scale.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMike Klimkosky, an EV expert who has long followed Musk, said Democrats are to blame for \u201cturning their backs\u201d on Musk.\n\n\u201cThey turned on him because they didn\u2019t like that he was one of the wealthiest people in the world,\u201d Klimkosky said. He added that Biden failed to support Musk\u2019s clean-energy efforts, even when they politically aligned with Democrats.\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s political ideology clearly began leaning right, he was vague on his stance on the 2024 presidential election until an assassination attempt on the GOP nominee during a campaign rally Saturday. Minutes after the attempt, Musk endorsed Trump as one of the \u201ctoughest\u201d presidents and has since supported the candidate nearly non-stop.\n\nYet, as the CEO of an electric vehicle manufacturer\u2014the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling vehicle last year in progressive California\u2014Musk\u2019s stance could clash with the political leanings of electric vehicle buyers, impacting sales.\n\n\u201cI could see that the Tesla CMO is spending a lot of time down at Mulligan's bar, you know, having a drink, because it makes their job a lot harder,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nEV buyers may begin to reject Musk\n\nIn the case of Tesla, Silbershatz wrote, liking a company and considering purchasing from it are two very different things.\n\n\u201cWhile Republicans trusted and liked Tesla more than Democrats in December 2023, the consideration score \u2013 a measure of how willing one is to purchase a Tesla \u2013 was higher among Democrats (38% vs. 31% among Republicans),\u201d Silbershatz said. \u201cThis may be linked to the fact that Democrats are more favorably disposed to electric vehicles than Republicans in general.\u201d\n\nSince Tesla\u2019s reputation is already quite polarized, its reputation might not change much in response to Musk\u2019s full-throttled support for Trump, according to Silbershatz. However, overall consideration rates (and, as a result, sales) will very likely suffer, since Democrats make up the greater share of EV buyers in the U.S.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the competition is intensifying within the EV category in the US, and that already 33% of Americans say their next EV will be a foreign-made car (according to a Caliber study in June 2024) \u2013 this endorsement does not bode well for Tesla\u2019s commercial prospects,\u201d Silbershatz wrote.\n\nTesla may already have begun feeling the pain. According to data from CivicScience, a consumer analytics platform, Democrats/Liberal favorability for Tesla has fallen to a low of 16% this month, compared to 39% in January. Among Republicans, Tesla\u2019s favorability remains unchanged, at a low-point of 22%.\n\nIn the short run, due to the \u201csad reality\u201d of the politicization of EVs, this seems inevitable, Murphy said. But in the long run, Musk could become \u201cNixon to China.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could be very helpful to open right-of-center Republican minds that have been getting his tribal messages from Trump and other politicians that EVs are double wagons,\u201d Murphy added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Those precedents are similar to the biblical story of Lazarus, who rose from the dead after being entombed for several days.\n\nNovavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) are two great recent examples. Each has shown incredible resilience in fighting back after having been thought dead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere\u2019s always room for more comeback stories in the stock market in the second half of 2024. Those comeback stories are likely to emerge from sectors that have recently suffered. Generally speaking, investors should look to the EV sector and growth stocks in order to find those opportunities. Comeback stories can emerge from any sector, of course. Let\u2019s look at three stocks to buy for a comeback.\n\nNokia (NOK) a backdrop featuring the Nokia logo with a mobile phone featuring the Nokia logo on its screen in the foreground\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) used to be one of the major mobile phone manufacturers globally. The company certainly missed the smartphone opportunity. Nokia instead continued to rely on its legacy Symbian operating system, completely missing the app-driven smartphone opportunity. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its smartphone in 2007. The rest is history.\n\nSince then, Nokia has emerged as a 5G infrastructure threat, especially in light of global politics.\u00a0The Chinese firm Huawei is one of its main rivals. Many countries are simply avoiding Huawei out of national security concerns. That is one of the reasons Nokia garnered increased attention over the past few years.\n\nNokia continues to focus on the security of its equipment and its reputation for reliable devices, including the famously indestructible 3310.\n\nAnd while the company continues to be a major 5G competitor, 5G hasn\u2019t produced expected returns yet. Networks are still largely under development. That means even those with 5G coverage are often left to use more extensive 4G networks. Higher plan costs simply aren\u2019t worth it yet, and until the build-out progresses, 5G stocks will continue to suffer.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why Nokia may rise again, positioning it for a comeback.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel Stock Bores Wall Street and Shareholders Should Be Worried\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock may already be in the early stages of a comeback. Well, maybe,\u00a0maybe not.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock reeled off a string of day-to-day increases recently that were not expected. Some believe the momentum will be short-lived due to short selling activity rather than any positive fundamental improvements.\n\nIntel has floundered in 2024. Still, the company continues to enact plans to become a major chip foundry in the future. Intel is convinced its expertise in Process technology and packaging makes it uniquely suited to the AI opportunity. While that may prove true in the future, it has not panned out thus far.\n\nThat\u2019s a good part of the reason Intel has performed so poorly in 2024. That poor performance has caused many to believe Intel is indeed dead. However, the company has too many positives to be counted out.\n\nIntel is the favorite son of Uncle Sam. The company has received billions in subsidies, and that investment could rise further. So, while Intel isn\u2019t currently a top performer, it might just be able to brute force its way into a better future through massive subsidization.\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) stock is down nearly 50% this year. Yet, it continues to have legitimate potential to rise from the ashes, so to speak.\n\nJune deliveries nearly doubled, rising 98% to 21,209 vehicles. Quarterly deliveries reached 57,373, increasing 144% and exceeding the high end of guidance. Those figures clearly indicate that Nio has all the potential to rebound.\n\nAt the same time, there is a massive price war going on in the EV sector, especially in China. There are more than 100 EV brands competing in the space in the country. That continues to put substantial downward pricing pressure on manufacturers overall. In response, Nio has launched a lower-price brand called Onvo. That vehicle will compete against Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y. It\u2019s priced just above $30,000.\n\nNIO is certainly down but not out. While the Chinese EV market is clearly reaching saturation, the company still has one of the best names and most dominant positions. Any number of those firms is much more likely to fail than Nio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Donald Trump-Elon Musk alliance is finally on, after an awkward courtship in which each curiously stalked the other.\n\nMusk, CEO of Tesla, has reportedly pledged to donate $45 million per month to a new political action committee that will work to get Trump elected to a second term as president in this year\u2019s election. If Musk follows through, and the funding continues through November, it could make Musk the biggest political donor in American history.\n\nThat could be just the beginning for Musk and Trump. They\u2019re certainly an odd couple with glaring differences. Musk is a climate change apostle, for instance, trying to solve global warming with the Tesla electric vehicles that have made him the world\u2019s richest person. Trump is a climate change denier who lampoons EVs and wants to subsidize gas-powered cars.\n\nEh, details. At a more cosmic level, Trump and Musk share a disdain for authority and for woke sensibilities. Each courts controversy, with an uncanny ability to promote himself by picking fights and insulting the right people. They\u2019re both businessmen with a mastery of marketing hyperbole and entrepreneurial moxie. A no-limits partnership could be in the offing.\n\nHere are seven new ways Trump and Musk could move ahead now that they\u2019ve joined forces.\n\nThe Tesla Cybertruck Donald J. Trump Limited MAGA Edition\n\nThis would be the premium version of Musk\u2019s pathbreaking pickup thingy, starting at $250,000. There would be gold everywhere, of course, plus flags, thumbs, and Trump\u2019s iconic signature woven into the upholstery. A future amphibious version will be shark-proof and unsinkable.\n\nThe Tesla presidential limousine\n\nAka, the CyberBeast. This will replace the current presidential limo, known as the Beast, which is a boring old Cadillac. The CyberBeast, an extended version of the Cybertruck, will feature 12-wheel drive, a helicopter landing pad, a driving range, and an Elon Musk bobblehead mounted on the dash.\n\nTesla golf carts at every Trump course\n\nTesla can easily downscale its electric vehicle technology to build a fleet of carts that will be the official mode of transportation at every Trump resort. Branded, of course, as the Cybercart. Donald Trump's and Elon Musk's Twitter accounts displayed on screens, Nov. 22, 2022. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nTrump Mars\n\nAs part of its mission to Mars, Musk\u2019s SpaceX will provide the Trump Organization with the galaxy\u2019s first development opportunities on the Red Planet, starting with a blended commercial-residential complex featuring amazing views of Jupiter and stopover space services for any able to pay. Trump Mars opens as early as 2045!\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trump-Musk Tax Fairness Act\n\nKnown as the Trusk Loophole. With full control of Congress in 2025, Republicans will pass a special tax exemption for Americans so grand that their mere existence betters humanity. To qualify, one must be either the richest American or the most aggrieved American, as determined by Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nXtra Social Media\n\nMusk\u2019s X and Trump\u2019s Truth Social will merge to form a social media colossus with only two accounts: Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Everybody will have to retweet everything Trump and Musk say, or else the IRS will audit them.\n\nDamp Sock Puppet Holdings\n\nThis Trump-Musk joint venture would be a laboratory for the two iconoclasts to experiment with improving democracy, managing dictators, stopping viruses at the US border, and cloning themselves. Shares would be available to the public under an innovative structure in which Trump and Musk each have a 51% ownership stake. If that doesn\u2019t seem to add up, you may not be ready for the next four years.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Here's how Tesla's Elon Musk explains his support for a seemingly anti-EV presidential ticket",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is more fervently backing (and apparently bankrolling) a Republican presidential ticket made up of two candidates deeply skeptical of government subsidies that helped his company and the electric-vehicle industry.\n\nSen. JD Vance, Trump's new running mate, notably has a stance on this issue to the right of even many Republicans.\n\nMusk\u2019s response \u2014 both on Tuesday morning and in recent months \u2014 has been to wave away any concerns.\n\n\"Take away the subsidies,\" he wrote in the wee hours Tuesday morning. \"It will only help Tesla.\"\n\nBut Vance would go even further than that.\n\nIn the Senate, Vance is leading the charge on a bill called the Drive American Act that aims to not only eliminate EV subsidies but \"replace them with the America First Vehicle Credit to promote gas-powered vehicles.\"\n\nNonetheless, after formally endorsing Trump this weekend, Musk then lobbied publicly for Vance and immediately touted the pick, saying the new ticket \"Resounds with victory.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a conference in Washington in 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSome Wall Street analysts think it could be a cunning move for Musk, and the removal of government subsidies may indeed hurt Musk\u2019s EV rivals more than him. Others are less sure.\n\nEither way, Musk\u2019s position also overlooks his own decades-long history as a recipient of generous government support.\n\nMusk has also touted his open line of communication with Trump when this issue is raised. He said in a recent Tesla shareholder meeting that the former president \"does call me out of the blue for no reason\" where Musk then makes the case for EVs.\n\n\"I can be persuasive,\" Musk added.\n\nBut Trump hasn't been persuaded to the EV cause publicly at least.\n\nWhile Trump has expressed admiration for Musk personally, the former President assails EVs as a bad product at nearly every campaign stop.\n\n\"Who wants to drive an electric car for the rest of your life?\" he recently asked a Florida crowd. The crowd quickly began lustily booing that idea.\n\nMusk has nonetheless also pledged $45 million per month to a pro-Trump super PAC in donations to help Trump win a second term, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk also spoke with Trump in recent days to make the case for Vance directly, according to a CNN report. Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance wave to the crowd during the first day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nCould Trump/Vance hurt EVs but help Tesla?\n\nWhether a Trump/Vance administration actually hurts Tesla or the EV sector (or both) is a point of disagreement on Wall Street.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives made the case in a recent Yahoo Finance Live appearance that Tesla's dominant position in the industry could help the company keep rivals at bay and \"widen the gap and technology lead.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Guggenheim's Ron Jewsikow said major changes such as a removal of the Biden-era $7,500 EV tax incentive \u2014 which both Trump and Vance are promising \u2014 would remove a \"key affordability enabler\" for Tesla.\n\nMusk himself has long taken a stance in opposition to all government credits, writing Tuesday: \"remove subsidies from all industries!\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla didn\u2019t respond to questions from Yahoo Finance about whether this post meant Musk would be opposed to Vance\u2019s call for new subsidies for oil-and-gas-fueled cars.\n\nEither way, his anti-subsidy stance is one Musk has taken since at least 2021. He has said that the benefits Tesla received from Biden's EV incentives are minimal.\n\nBut Tesla has long benefited from government tax credits and the government support helped Tesla get to where is it today. The website subsidy tracker estimates that Tesla has received 109 government awards since 2007 with an estimated value of nearly $3 billion.\n\nA Los Angeles Times investigation put the tally even higher and estimated that Musk's various companies received about $4.9 billion in government support just through 2015.\n\nA keen focus for Musk on other issues\n\nMusk's focus on tax credits and subsidies \u2014 publicly at least \u2014 pales in comparison to other issues.\n\nA review of his X feed features a flood of political commentary, almost exclusively on subjects largely unrelated to his company's bottom lines.\n\nIn less than 18 hours since the Vance announcement, as an example, Musk has weighed in on issues like transgender children in public schools to whether the Secret Service director should be fired to media traffic patterns and many others.\n\nMusk has been particularly animated by immigration to the point where, as the Wall Street Journal recently reported, he has held talks with Trump about a formal role on the issue in 2025. Musk denies that the talks have taken place.\n\nMusk's recent endorsement of Trump is also the culmination of years of increasing ties between the GOP and the world's richest man.\n\nIt was almost 2 years ago when Musk first appeared at a GOP fundraiser, speaking at a 2022 GOP donor retreat in Wyoming hosted by then-House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nMusk has also been deeply critical of Biden almost since the moment he took office.\n\nMusk also seemed to acknowledge Tuesday morning that parts of his strong pro-Trump position now are due to actions early in the Biden administration that prioritized the EV efforts of his rivals.\n\nResponding to one post that pointed out Biden's past embrace of the EV efforts of GM (GM) over Tesla, Musk responded \"I try not to start fights, but I do finish them.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "It\u2019s not been a great year for transportation stocks.\n\nThe benchmark SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (NYSEARCA:XTN) has fallen 9% over the past 12 months. That\u2019s a dramatic divergence from the S&P 500, which is up 25% over the same time span.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. For one, the transportation ETF has investments in airlines and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) companies, both of which have seen heavy volatility recently. In addition, broader macroeconomic concerns have caused investors to worry about falling freight volumes for cargo transportation companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, given the selloffs across the sector, many of these fears are already baked into the sector\u2019s stock prices. These are seven of the most promising transportation stocks in own for Q3 of this year and beyond.\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is a gigantic transportation company primarily engaged in parcel delivery services. With annual revenues of more than $80 billion, FedEx is an integral part of the logistics network that ships freight around North America and internationally.\n\nFor years, FedEx had a simple attractive investment narrative around growth from e-commerce shopping. People ordering from the internet, rather than going to the mall, was a fantastic development for the parcel delivery industry.\n\nHowever, investors soured on this theme in recent years due to worries that\u00a0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would eat into the market. However, it seems that Amazon has dialed back its investments in logistics and fulfillment assets. While Amazon and other competitors are certainly a concern, FedEx\u2019s core market remains robust.\n\nThe company\u2019s most recent earnings report reaffirmed that view. FDX spiked 15% higher following a strong report and news around strategic actions to further improve profitability. This has some analysts suggesting that FDX stock could have 100% upside from here.\n\nAirbus (EADSY) A photograph of the sun setting from a vantage point above the clouds.\n\nSource: OlegRi/ShutterStock.com\n\nAircraft manufacturer Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) has a tremendous opportunity right now.\n\nThe large aircraft market is effectively a duopoly, with only Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) offering the largest classes and highest-range jets available for commercial aviation. While there is some competition in the regional jet market, Boeing and Airbus have tremendous pricing power for their models such as Boeing 747s and Airbus A380s.\n\nAnd, for the time being, Boeing is facing tremendous scrutiny. After a series of crashes and other technical mishaps, regulators are laying into the company. In fact, Boeing recently pled guilty to criminal charges related to past accidents. And Boeing mechanics allege that unsafe behavior has continued to occur at the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis should lead to an improved outlook for Airbus, as the only viable competitor for larger-class jets. Indeed, the industry is facing a plane shortage right now, so Airbus should have a huge demand ramp-up in coming months and years. EADSY stock has dipped over the past quarter, offering investors an improved entry point right now.\n\nUnion Pacific (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.\n\nSource: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is one of North America\u2019s class one railroads. It has dominant market share on many freight routes within the western part of the U.S.\n\nIn addition, Union Pacific has been active in the Mexican market for over\u00a030 years. It jumped onto that trend just prior to the time the NAFTA free trade deal went into effect. Also, Union Pacific owns more than one-quarter of a leading Mexican railroad, Ferromex, giving it upside from Mexico\u2019s growing manufacturing boom.\n\nUNP stock is down around 5% year-to-date (YTD). Analysts are worried that a slowing economy may lower freight demand. That\u2019s certainly a valid concern. But upcoming interest rate cuts may jumpstart freight shipments. In any case, with the recent underperformance, Union Pacific is on offer at a fair 20 times forward earnings today.\n\nGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (OMAB) international stocks mexico\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (NASDAQ:OMAB) \u2014 or North Central Airport Group in English \u2014 is a private Mexican airport operator.\n\nAbout 25 years ago, Mexico\u2019s government decided to privatize the majority of its country\u2019s commercial airports, splitting them up into four distinct operating groups. OMAB got the key airports near the U.S.-Mexican border that are now at the center of the current reshoring/manufacturing boom.\n\nThe company\u2019s flagship airport serves Monterrey, which is Mexico\u2019s second largest urban area, trailing only Mexico City. Monterrey is also Mexico\u2019s hub for numerous manufacturing industries including automobiles. That was reflected in Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) decision to locate its multi-billion dollar gigafactory in Monterrey. As more businesses locate in Monterrey, that should increase both business travel and freight-related services at the city\u2019s airport.\n\nFurther, OMAB has been able to cash in on the rising prosperity in its region. It has grown its revenues from $451 million in 2019 to $851 million in 2023, showing tremendous upside despite the Covid-19 related traffic disruption. In addition, this business is highly profitable, trading around 15 times forward earnings while offering a 7% dividend yield.\n\nCorporacion America Airports (CAAP) two women carrying luggage in an airport\n\nSource: Shine Nucha / Shutterstock\n\nAirports are a tremendous asset class. They have a monopoly within their local market. And travelers are generally not price sensitive and are willing to splash out a lot on money on food, drinks and duty-free shopping. Airports have other attractive ancillary revenue streams as well like hotels, car rentals and advertising.\n\nThis makes Corporacion America Airports (NYSE:CAAP) an attractive investment. It is the largest private airport operator in the world by number of airports held.\n\nCorporacion America Airports is most known for its dozens of Argentine airport properties, including the facilities serving the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The airport group also holds airports in Italy, Armenia, Ecuador, Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nCAAP stock had collapsed following its 2018 IPO. It fell victim to the one-two punch of the Argentina hyperinflation crisis and the 2020 travel shutdowns. However, the stock has come roaring back, rising almost 1,000% from its lows, as travel demand has surged to new highs.\n\nAlso, reasons for optimism shine through on the political front. Argentina elected Javier Milei, a staunchly pro-business president, in its 2023 election. And there\u2019s another positive. Milei previously served as the chief economist for Corporacion America Airports prior to entering politics. All this has CAAP stock set to lift off thanks to strong tailwinds on both the economic and political fronts.\n\nForward Air (FWRD) Plenty of shipping containers stacked at the Port of Hamburg and blue sky\n\nSource: Hieronymus Ukkel / Shutterstock.com\n\nForwardAir (NASDAQ:FWRD) is an air freight and logistics company. It operates in two segments of Expedited Freight and Intermodal. And it provides services such as local pick-up and delivery, less-than-truckload services, intermodal container drayage services and other such items. Forward Air serves various clients such as cargo carriers, freight forwarders, third-party logistics firms and retailers.\n\nFor many years, FWRD stock as on a steady upward trajectory. Shares rose from around $15 coming out of the 2008 financial crisis to its recent peak of more than $100. But disaster struck over the past year, with shares falling as much as 90% since July 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s primarily due to a controversial\u00a0merger with Omni Logistics. Omni itself was a rollup of several smaller freight companies. Many analysts and investors have been skeptical about how long it will take to combine Omni with Forward Air and wring out anticipated merger synergies.\n\nHowever, the tide is turning. FWRD stock has doubled off its recent lows following the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) along with an activist investor taking a large stake in the company. As the company gets back on track, shares should have considerable upside.\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) A photo of a J.B. Hunt Intermodel truck\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) is an intermodal transportation company which offers a variety of services for its end clients.\n\nThe company derives around half its revenues from shipping its own containers along class one railroads. It also offerw tailored fleet services, for-hire truckload, truck brokering and final-mile delivery services.\n\nJBHT stock has historically been an expensive one compared to other transportation picks due to its strong management team and diversified business model. However, the stock has pulled back more than 15% YTD due to mounting concerns around the broader macroeconomic environment.\n\nThat gives investors a decent discount on this leading transportation stock. And the company could have considerable upside as it taps into AI functionality to improve its clients\u2019 supply chains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in CAAP and OMAB stock.

        "title": "Nvidia\u2019s market cap will soar to $50 trillion\u2014yes, trillion\u2014says early investor in Amazon and Tesla",
        "content": "Nvidia\u2019s rise has been astronomical\u2014it\u2019s grown its market capitalization from $1.1 trillion to $3.1 trillion in the past 12 months\u2014and a tech investor who predicted the early success of Amazon and Tesla said this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I\u2019ve ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions,\u201d James Anderson, former partner at investment giant Baillie Gifford, told the Financial Times. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia\u2019s lead is intact.\u201d\n\nThe chipmaker behind OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has soared thanks to the AI boom, which has minted half-a-million new millionaires who invested in the tech that has begun to revolutionize the workplace and media consumption. Nvidia, along with tech giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, are worth $14.5 trillion and make up about 32% of the S&P 500. With the AI darling\u2019s data center revenue growing at about 60%, Anderson calculated, should the pattern continue over the next decade, the company would have a market capitalization of about $49 trillion. That\u2019s more than the entire value of every company in the S&P 500, which is roughly $45.84 trillion. Anderson estimated a 10% to 15% probability of this outcome.\n\nAnderson\u2019s projection is a lofty one, but his hunches have proved correct before. With a go-big-or-go-home mentality, he was one of Amazon\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s biggest champions (for the EV giant, Anderson\u2019s investments were second only to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s). From 2005 to 2021, Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, managed by Baillie Gifford, saw returns of 2,240%. It invested in Nvidia in 2016. Lingotto Investment Management, where Anderson is now an investor, has a $650 million fund with Nvidia as its largest position.\n\nNvidia didn\u2019t have a clear path to success when Anderson first began investing in the company, he said. It remained to be seen if it would be a gaming, crypto, or AI company. But it did have the advantage of early success, unlike Amazon and Tesla, which \u201cdidn\u2019t start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there.\u201d In some ways, Anderson still sees Nvidia as a nimble company.\n\n\u201cIt is the long duration of the development of [graphic processing units] usage in AI\u2014and not just AI\u2014from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nNot so fast\n\nOther finance experts don\u2019t share Anderson\u2019s bullish take on Nvidia. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, argues Nvidia is riding a wave of early AI optimism.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe momentum is clearly with Nvidia,\u201d Damodaran told CNBC in May. \u201cThey can do nothing wrong. Everything they touch turns to gold.\u201d\n\nDamodaran said Tesla experienced a similar rally in 2020, when its market cap soared, peaking in 2021 at $1.2 trillion, only for shares to plummet about 30% this year alone. Meta and Google also grappled with increased competition that have loosened their grip on the tech world. While Nvidia has the earnings to back up its sky-high value, the expectations for the future of the company may be too steep, he argued. Damodaran said the AI chip market is not worth $1 trillion alone, and the AI market more broadly is worth about $2 trillion or $3 trillion, meaning Nvidia would have to tap into several big AI markets to maintain and grow its value.\n\n\u201cIt's clearly a possibility,\u201d Damodaran said. \u201cBut is it plausible? I don't think so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say if Nvidia has the juice to lead Big Tech into the AI frontier in the long term, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton said. Nvidia\u2019s colossal growth may appear scary, but it\u2019s sustainable, particularly as the demand for AI is expected to increase.\n\n\u201cDespite all of us worrying that eventually this demand for chips will slow down, we haven't really seen that slowdown happen yet,\u201d Clinton told Yahoo Finance last month. \u201cAnd it may take longer to slow down than we think.\u201d\n\nWith Nvidia making up over 80% of the global GPU semiconductor market, the company will likely continue to ride high in the foreseeable future, Clinton said.\n\n\u201cCan Nvidia maintain its dominant position providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models?\u201d he said. \u201cI think they can for the next three to five years.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla stock in flux as Musk's Trump support and robotaxi delay whipsaw shares",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares are on edge Tuesday morning, following an early bump on Monday that fizzled into the trading session. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is driving the news.\n\nOver the weekend, Musk endorsed former President Donald Trump following a failed assassination attempt at a campaign rally. Musk\u2019s closeness to Trump is seen as a positive for Tesla, despite Trump\u2019s disdain for EVs and desire to roll back EV tax credits implemented under President Biden. Despite this, the Wall Street Journal reported Musk will commit a massive $45 million a month to a pro-Trump Super PAC, further cementing his commitment to a second Trump term (though Musk indicated in a tweet that the report was false).\n\nMusk isn\u2019t the only billionaire outwardly supporting Trump, but government policies associated with Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House would have significant ramifications for Tesla. CEOs listen to President Donald Trump during a meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Jan. 23, 2017, in Washington, D.C. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nAnother bit of news with significant implications for Tesla is the automaker\u2019s future with robotaxis. Musk all but confirmed late Monday that Tesla would be delaying its robotaxi reveal, which was slated for Aug. 8.\n\n\u201cRequested what I think is an important design change to the front, and extra time allows us to show off a few other things,\u201d Musk tweeted in reply to a post regarding changes and a delay to Tesla\u2019s robotaxi.\n\nTesla stock is still nearly flat for the year despite a steep early-year sell-off as the enthusiasm behind Tesla\u2019s robotaxi, shareholder approval of Musk\u2019s controversial pay package, and new growth in Tesla\u2019s energy business sent Tesla stock on a steep rise \u2014 nearly 30% in the past month.\n\nIt was that move that led to UBS downgrading the stock at the end of the week last week.\n\n\u201cTSLA has always traded with a premium attached to it for other, future growth initiatives. However, at current levels, we believe that unidentifiable premium is too significant,\u201d UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHowever, analysts at Mizuho and Citi bumped their price targets up for Tesla and reiterated their Neutral ratings, forced to play catch-up on Tesla\u2019s stock move.\n\nFinally, a new piece of bullish news for Tesla crossed on early Tuesday as Bloomberg reported the automaker had posted nearly 800 openings for new positions, from service jobs to postings for engineers in the robotaxi and Optimus robot divisions.\n\nIn April Musk had emailed Tesla staff confirming a \"more than 10%\" headcount reduction following prior reports that layoffs could hit as much as 20% of staff. Following Musk\u2019s layoff confirmation, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives said the cuts were an \u201cunfortunately necessary move for Tesla to cut costs with a softer growth outlook.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile 800 new job postings pale in comparison to the thousands that were likely laid off back in the spring, fresh hiring may indicate that Tesla sees better times ahead from a financial perspective.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday voiced against subsidies including a federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for which several of its vehicles are eligible.\n\nWhat Happened: \u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk said in response to a Tesla enthusiast who opined that subsidies benefit unprofitable EV makers more than they help Tesla. On the other hand, the EV tax credit is harming the profitability of the industry, the enthusiast said.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nMusk\u2019s comment comes on the heels of his support for Republican Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election and also for Senator JD Vance who Trump picked as his vice-presidential running mate. Republicans have often voiced criticism for the Biden administration\u2019s support and push for EVs including EV subsidies aimed at bringing down the cost of electric vehicles.\n\nVance last year even proposed the Drive American Act aimed at eliminating EV subsidies and replacing them with up to $7,500 credit for new gas or diesel-powered vehicles, including hybrids, made in America.\n\nWhy It Matters: Although Musk has dismissed subsidies, Tesla has received them in the past including a $465 million federal loan in 2010.\n\nIn April 2023, Musk said that Tesla\u2019s competitive position would improve if all subsidies ended. \u201cOur competitors require subsidies, not us. That said, if competitors get subsidies, Tesla should get them too,\u201d the CEO then said.\n\nSeveral cars on Tesla\u2019s vehicle lineup are currently eligible for a federal EV tax credit of $7,500 including all variants of Tesla\u2019s Model Y SUV, three out of four variants of Model 3, and the all-wheel drive version of the Model X.\n\nRead More:\n\nRory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US.

        "title": "EV Roundup: BYDDY's Acquisition of Rever &amp; LCID's Recalls Draw Attention",
        "content": "Last week, the Biden administration announced its decision to award nearly $2 billion in grants to boost electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and assembly across eight states, including key battlegrounds in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia. General Motors will receive $500 million to convert a Lansing, MI plant for EV production, supporting a U.S. battery supply chain. Fiat Chrysler is set to receive $335 million to convert an Illinois plant and $250 million for an Indiana facility to make EV components. Blue Bird will get $80 million to produce electric school buses in Georgia. Harley-Davidson has been awarded $89 million to expand its electric motorcycle production in Pennsylvania, while Volvo Group will receive $208 million to upgrade facilities in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland for heavy-duty electric trucks.\n\nOn the news front, China-based EV giant BYD Company Limited BYDDY announced its decision to buy a 20% stake in Rever Automotive to consolidate its presence in the Southeast Asia auto market and to enhance its competitiveness in Thailand's auto industry. The Californian EV startup Lucid Group LCID issued a software recall over a power loss glitch. EV pioneer Tesla TSLA introduced a new rear-wheel drive Model 3 vehicle and deferred its Robotaxi event by two months. Japanese auto giant Toyota TM invested in IONNA to enhance EV infrastructure and promote sustainable transportation.\n\nLast Week\u2019s Top Stories\n\nLucid issued a recall for approximately 5,251 of its 2022-2023 Air luxury sedans due to a software issue that could lead to power loss, per the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The problem involves the High Voltage Interlock safety mechanism, which could be mistakenly activated when the vehicle is in Drive or Reverse, causing a power outage. However, the brakes, steering and displays would remain functional.\n\nAdditionally, LCID is recalling 2022-2024 Air sedans due to a faulty coolant heater that may fail to defrost the windshield, affecting 7,506 vehicles. Despite a low failure rate of 1.2%, Lucid has issued a software update to alert drivers if the High Voltage Coolant Heater (HVCH) malfunctions. Affected vehicles will receive a new HVCH at no cost.\n\nThe company also released its second-quarter production and delivery report last week. The EV startup produced and sold 2,110 and 2,394 vehicles, respectively, during the three months ended Jun 30.\n\nTesla introduced a new rear-wheel drive Model 3 long-range vehicle priced $5,000 lower than its all-wheel drive counterpart. The new variant starts at $42,490 and qualifies for a $7,500 federal EV tax credit, reducing its effective price to $34,990, which is less than the base Model 3. Prices for the base Model 3 long-range all-wheel drive and performance variants remain unchanged. The Model 3 and Model Y dominate Tesla's sales, accounting for 95% of global deliveries in the second quarter, with 422,405 units delivered.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla's eagerly awaited robotaxi event, initially scheduled for Aug 8, has been postponed to October. On the first-quarter 2024 earnings call, Elon Musk confirmed plans to showcase the company\u2019s purpose-built robotaxi or Cybercab in August, raising investor expectations. However, the delay has disappointed investors, leading to an 8% drop in Tesla's stock last Thursday, which ended an 11-day rally that had offset its losses for the year.\n\nTesla carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBYD inked a deal to purchase a 20% stake in Thai dealer Rever to strengthen its position in the Southeast Asia auto market. Both companies aim to enhance their competitiveness in Thailand's auto industry. BYD officially entered Thailand's passenger car market on Aug 8, 2022, through a joint announcement with Rever in Bangkok.\n\nOn Jul 4, 2024, BYD opened its factory in Thailand, marking the production of its 8 millionth new energy vehicle. Rever, which operates more than 100 showrooms in Thailand, began selling BYD vehicles in 2022, making BYD the country's top-selling EV brand. Per Liu Xueliang, general manager of BYDDY's Asia-Pacific auto sales division, currently, there are 115 BYD sales outlets in Thailand. With the new plant in operation, BYD plans to expand its local sales network.\n\nBYD and Rever will broaden their collaboration beyond passenger cars to include commercial vehicles.The Thailand plant produces models like the all-electric Dolphin and Seal, as well as the Atto 3, which Rever sells in Thailand. BYD also plans to produce plug-in hybrid electric vehicle models, including the Sea Lion 6.\n\nToyota joined forces with seven major auto biggies by investing in IONNA, an EV charging network company. This strategic partnership aims to enhance charging accessibility for battery EV (BEV) users and promote the adoption of sustainable transportation.\n\nToyota's investment in IONNA aligns it with automakers such as BMW, Honda, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, who have also pledged their support to IONNA. The collaboration among the eight automakers represents a unified effort to invest in and develop EV charging infrastructure, addressing a critical need for the growing EV market.\n\nTogether, these companies are backing IONNA's ambitious plan to install more than 30,000 high-powered charging ports across North America by 2030. This network will feature DC fast chargers equipped with both NACS and CCS connectors, catering to a wide range of BEV drivers. The deployment of DC fast chargers across the United States and Canada would boost customer confidence in BEVs and facilitate their adoption.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major EV players over the last week and six-month period.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: Tesla (TSLA) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Tesla (TSLA) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -31.9%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $25.13 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.76% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla?\n\nFor Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.13%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering a surprise of -2.17%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nTesla doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Elon Musk was taken by surprise when he discovered that Tesla influencers on YouTube earn significantly more than on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nWhat Happened: On Thursday, responding to allegations of being a \u201cpaid promoter\u201d for Tesla, Farzad Mesbahi revealed that his YouTube earnings from ad revenue were 50-100 times higher than what he made on X.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

He said that X has so far enabled pre-roll ads for only a few creators, but it still doesn\u2019t compare to YouTube\u2019s payout.\n\nTrending: Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100\n\nThis revelation comes in the wake of Musk\u2019s efforts to challenge YouTube\u2019s dominance by introducing new ad-targeting features on X.

In February, while sharing the result of his experiment, MrBeast said, \u201cMy first X video made over $250,000! But it's a bit of a fa\u00e7ade.

        "title": "Elon Musk blames robo-taxi delay on \u2018important design change,\u2019 but he claims to have a surprise up his sleeve",
        "content": "Elon Musk granted his engineers at Tesla more time to finish development of a robotaxi prototype, pushing back the model\u2019s heavily anticipated Aug. 8 unveiling by weeks or even months.\n\nWhile the carmaker\u2019s CEO didn\u2019t confirm last week\u2019s\u00a0Bloomberg report it would be postponed until October, he will almost certainly face questions about it from investors during the second-quarter earnings call scheduled for next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRequested what I think is an important design change to the front,\u201d he posted on Monday, \u201cand extra time allows us to show off a few other things.\u201d\n\nHe did not go into further detail what those surprises might be, but fans have speculated it could be everything from the upcoming entry car to the all new Roadster. The latter was initially shown off during the Tesla Semi unveil in December 2017, but has since been re-engineered.\n\nIn the aftermath of Thursday\u2019s\u00a0Bloomberg report, investors had been pressing Musk to confirm or deny the story, since it wiped more than 8% off the stock price. Some even demanded the SEC investigate the news agency for market manipulation since it did not name its sources and the news had not been officially confirmed.\n\nRequested what I think is an important design change to the front, and extra time allows us to show off a few other things\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 15, 2024\n\nMusk\u2019s comments came in response to a video posted by Warren Redlich, a Tesla influencer best known for saying he\u2019d happily take a bullet for the entrepreneur. In it, Redlich said his own private contacts told him there would be a major change to the vehicle that engineers\u2014not Musk\u2014suggested would need two months to implement.\n\nGiven Musk and Tesla would be motivated to prove the mainstream media wrong, the YouTuber said he wouldn\u2019t yet give up on next month\u2019s unveil: \u201cThey are doing their level best to get something that they can show on August 8th.\u201d\n\nWhile Tesla staff may yet pull off a miracle, it looks as if that date is off the cards.\n\nGrowth narrative in jeopardy until Musk pulled Robotaxi trump card\n\nMusk\u2019s well-timed April announcement of the robotaxi unveiling wasn\u2019t random. It came at a crucial juncture for Tesla, reinvigorating confidence that a challenging 2024 would not mark the start of a worrying new trend but would merely be a speed bump on the way to a $30 trillion market cap.\n\nUntil the announcement, investors had feared Tesla\u2019s aging line-up was no longer as competitive as it once was and would increasingly require heavy discounting to generate\u00a0sufficient sales growth. Even the arrival of the Cybertruck looked like it would underwhelm after launching with a much lower range and much higher price than first promised.\n\nStory continues\n\nLate last year, Tesla sought to assure the market that its investment story remained fundamentally intact, claiming it was merely going through a rough patch before a wave of new models would accelerate growth thanks to their revolutionary engineering. This would cut the cost of production by half over the current platform that underpins the Model 3 and Y, allowing it to be sold highly profitably despite a low entry price of around $25,000 each.\n\nOn April 2, however, cracks began to emerge in that narrative.\n\nFirst Tesla shocked the market with Q1 delivery figures that fell well short of even the most bearish forecast. Even Tesla bull Dan Ives called news of Tesla\u2019s first year-on-year contraction in quarterly sales since the pandemic an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d that could not simply be explained away.\n\n\u201cWe view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story,\u201d he wrote on April 2. Either Musk turns the story around, or \u201csome darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative.\u201d\n\nRobotaxi restored confidence when Musk needed shareholder support\n\nSome 72 hours later, Reuters then dropped a bombshell report that Tesla was scrapping plans to build an entry level car on the promised next-gen vehicle platform. Instead it would prioritize its robotaxi model\u2014a technology most experts believe is years away from full maturity.\n\nReuters is lying (again)\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 5, 2024\n\nThis pivot sparked widespread alarm that millions of vehicles worth of\u00a0future growth that underpinned investor valuation models just went up in smoke for no clear reason.\n\nInitially Musk played down the report, claiming that Reuters was not telling the truth. Then out of the blue he announced the Aug. 8 robotaxi unveiling. This nugget of information was enough to put a floor in the stock that prevented a further downward spiral in the price.\n\nDays later, the CEO would go on to request that shareholders ratify a record pay package now worth $77 billion, and he needed their support right when Tesla was the worst performing stock in the S&P 500.\n\nBy the time Tesla published its Q1 earnings later that month, investors had already made up their minds that Musk had flagged to the market the\u00a0worst was behind it.\n\nWhile pushing back the reveal date doesn\u2019t alter that thesis, it does raise the question whether the date had been discussed with anyone in senior management or signed off by Tesla\u2019s board of directors.\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment made outside of regular business hours.\n\nTesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 5, 2024\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The EV market is heating up in both domestic and international markets. While the EV sector in the U.S. has a projected compound annual growth rate of 15.5% until 2032, the international market is looking at a slightly higher target of 15.9%. This makes this a highly lucrative sector \u2013 and also one several companies want to enter.\n\nThis fragmentation has had a clear impact recently. Many were shocked when it was revealed that Tesla Motors\u2018 (NASDAQ:TSLA) market share in the U.S. fell to below 50%. This fragmentation is good for both consumers and investors \u2013 a higher supply will lead to a lower average price and more options for all types of investors.\n\nA larger number of companies in the EV space will also allow investors to diversify their EV assets. Here are three EV stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global automotive company that designs, manufactures, and sells vehicles and vehicle parts. In the EV market, GM has made significant strides with its commitment to an all-electric future. The company aims to launch 30 new global EVs by 2025.\n\nRegarding quarterly revenue growth, GM\u2019s revenue was up in the first quarter by 7.6% from a year ago, reaching $43.1 billion. Net income of $2.98 billion was up 24.4% from a year ago. GM stock has great financials, consistently beating earnings per share predictions over the past year.\n\nFor the full year, GM increased its guidance to range of $12.5 billion and $14.5 billion in adjusted earnings, from a previous range of $12 billion to $14 billion.\n\nRecently, GM stock has been up 5.8% for the past week. Factors influencing GM stock value include a $500 million federal grant to enhance EV production at the GM Lansing Grand River plant in Michigan and a $390 million investment by GM supplier Gestamp to upgrade its Michigan-based manufacturing facilities. All this positions GM as one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer specializing in premium smart SUVs. The company emphasizes extended-range electric vehicles to alleviate range anxiety. Li Auto integrates advanced technology and luxurious design to provide safe, convenient, and comfortable mobility solutions.\n\nIt\u2019s currently trading under $21, and is up over 9% over the last month. The company has reported troubling earnings lately, missing its last quarter estimate by a huge margin of 26 cents per share. Revenue in the first quarter was $3.6 billion, up 36.4% over last year, but the company reported a loss of $81 million. Recent reports indicate positive analyst ratings, suggesting an average price target of $34.95.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has announced plans to introduce new EV models, including a pure electric vehicle, which is expected to drive future growth. Additionally, Li Auto has been ramping up its infrastructure with new manufacturing facilities and increased development in research and development. The stock\u2019s significant upside potential and the company\u2019s strategic initiatives make it a definite EV stock to buy.\n\nNissan Motor Co. (NSANY) Closeup logo nissan car with soft-focus and over light in the background\n\nSource: Memory Stockphoto / Shutterstock\n\nNissan Motor (OTCMKTS:NSANY) is one of the world\u2019s most renowned automobile companies. It operates internationally, although it is based in Japan. Nissan also operates under the Infiniti brand. While it has specialized in internal combustion engine technology, it is making moves into the EV space, especially with the sale of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nNisson is trading over the counter at $7 at this writing. Analysts have given this company a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, and an average growth target of $7.85. This is due to its strong technical and fundamental aspects. It has seen a quarterly revenue boost of 13.5% from a year ago, and has a profit margin of 3.36%, lower than the sector average. However, the company has large stockpiles of cash on hand, sitting at $2.02 trillion. This stockpile will allow the company to invest in research and development.\n\nWe have seen evidence of this recently. It has been reported that the company is collaborating with Honda (NYSE:HMC) in reference to EV charging networks and software. This will result in shared use of this technology. This creates a strong case to invest in NSANY for its future EV plans.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "According to a report by the Financial Times on Tuesday, one of the most successful tech investors said Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be worth almost $50 trillion in a decade.\n\nThe number represents more than the combined current market value of the entire S&P 500.\n\nHowever, the publication reported James Anderson, well-known for his early bets on companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as saying that \"the potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions.\"\n\n\"This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" he reportedly added.\n\nNvidia has been a primary beneficiary of the surge in chip demand following the emergence of generative AI. Its shares have surged over 175% in the last 12 months, pushing its market capitalization above the $3 trillion mark.\n\nAnderson, who recently teamed up with the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family to launch Lingotto Investment Management, said Nvidia's \"persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\"\n\nWhen assessing the difference between Nvidia and some of his previous successful tech bets Anderson notes: \"Amazon, Tesla etc didn't start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there\".\n\nHe explained that the real growth in data center AI chip demand looked to be running at about 60% per year. When assessing the next decade, he stated that 10 years of 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, would result in earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 a share.\n\nThe FT said Anderson remarked that an Nvidia share might be worth $20,000 in 10 years, translating to a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned the probability of this type of outcome at 10% to 15%.\n\nHe added: \"It is the long duration of the development of GPU usage in AI \u2014 and not just AI \u2014 from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson believes the route to the extremely lofty valuation will likely be volatile, and it would not be surprising if the chipmaker had one or more significant drawdowns.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCan Nvidia really hit $50 trillion market cap like this tech investor suggests?\n\nThese stocks are benefiting from what could be a larger market rotation\n\nProgressive shares up 2% as Q2 earnings exceed estimates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks Down 42% to 75% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The bull market continues to rage on in 2024, with the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite up 24% year to date. Investors looking for discounted stocks that could join the rally are in the right place. Here are three stocks of industry-leading companies that could be ready for big moves.\n\n1. Carnival\n\nTravel companies have experienced strong demand over the last few years, and Carnival(NYSE: CCL) continues to look like one of the best stocks to profit from this trend. It operates several brands beyond its namesake Carnival Cruise Line.\n\nIt owns AIDA Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Seabourn, and Princess Cruises, which makes Carnival the largest cruise company in the world.\n\nThe stock has doubled since 2022 but is 75% off its pre-pandemic peak. The disruption that the coronavirus caused to the travel industry forced Carnival to take on a lot of debt to fund operations, which has weighed on the stock's performance, but the company's improving prospects on top of healthy demand trends is a catalyst for the shares.\n\nManagement is intently focused on improving efficiency throughout the business to boost profits. It has invested in more fuel-efficient ships in recent years and optimized its pricing strategy to maximize margins.\n\nIt also announced earlier this year that it will consolidate P&O Cruises Australia into Carnival Cruise Line, which will increase capacity for one of the company's best-performing brands.\n\nThe company reported a noticeable jump in operating profit last quarter, and more improvement should benefit the stock. Shares trade at a modest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 15.5. This is an attractive valuation considering Wall Street's expectation for earnings to increase sharply over the next few years.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has grown into one of the most recognized brands in the auto industry, which is a remarkable feat. The electric vehicle (EV) company was generating annual revenue of just over $400 million in 2012, but last year its sales topped $96 billion, which is impressive on its own considering the macroeconomic headwinds like inflation and higher interest rates that have weighed on consumer spending lately.\n\nAfter falling 42% from its previous peak, Tesla stock has risen sharply over the last month. While the valuation looks very expensive, currently sitting at a forward P/E of 96, there are a few reasons this could be the beginning of a new bull run.\n\nHigher interest rates have made it more expensive to finance the purchase of a new car, which contributed to slowing sales growth and a slumping share price last year. But the company said second-quarter deliveries were up 15% over the previous quarter, which could be the start of a trend, especially since the company continues to deliver more Cybertrucks.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith only 1.7 million vehicles delivered over the last year, Tesla still has a lot of room to gain market share in an industry with over 80 million vehicles produced each year. This is why management is working on increasing manufacturing capacity, including expanding production of its own batteries to secure the supply chain of this crucial component.\n\nWhile the company continues ramp up production of the Cybertruck, there are plenty of other looming sales opportunities that could drive the stock higher in the coming years, including the Cybercab, Tesla Semi truck, and humanoid robots -- all reflecting Tesla's growing investment in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nAlibaba Group(NYSE: BABA) is the largest online retail business and cloud service provider in China. It also has an expanding e-commerce presence overseas with AliExpress.\n\nAlibaba doesn't sell goods itself but generates revenue from charging service fees to merchants that list items for sale on its popular e-commerce marketplaces. It is a profitable business that is a screaming buy at these bargain-basement share prices.\n\nThe stock has fallen 75% from its previous high due to slowing sales growth amid a weakened Chinese economy. Alibaba has also faced stiffer competition from rival e-commerce companies like PDD's Temu and JD.com. But sales trends are looking better in 2024.\n\nIt's starting to fight back aggressively against competitors. Lower prices helped drive increases in buyers and purchase frequency last quarter. Meanwhile, Alibaba's international expansion efforts are going well, with revenue from the digital commerce segment up 45% year over year last quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Alibaba's cloud business is still struggling to pull out of its slump. Revenue grew just 3% year over year last quarter, which pales in comparison to the double-digit growth of other world-leading cloud companies.\n\nBut recent efforts to lower product pricing and integrate the Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 large language model, a type of AI model that can learn to write text and create images, shows potential for Alibaba Cloud to return to the double-digit growth it enjoyed a few years ago.\n\nThe stock is up 17% off its 52-week low, but still trades at an ultra-cheap forward P/E of 9 times this year's earnings estimate. It could double in value and still trade at a discount to the S&P 500's average P/E multiple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Elon Musk plans to allocate approximately $45 million per month to a new super political-action (PAC) committee supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n\nThis group, named America PAC, also counts among its backers Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) co-founder Joe Lonsdale, the Winklevoss twins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft, and her husband, Joe Craft, the CEO of Alliance Resource Partners LP (NASDAQ:ARLP).\n\nFormed in June, America PAC aims to focus on voter registration and encouraging early and mail-in voting in swing states, the WSJ said, citing sources familiar with the matter. The coalition has observed that Democrats have historically excelled in \"get out the vote\" efforts and noted the significant resources the Biden campaign has dedicated to on-the-ground efforts in swing states. America PAC intends to counteract these efforts.\n\nAs the world\u2019s richest individual with a net worth exceeding $250 billion, Musk\u2019s planned contribution to America PAC is reportedly substantial.\n\nA filing from Monday revealed that America PAC had raised $8.75 million in contributions during the three months ending June 30. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk planned to begin his donations in July.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO officially endorsed Trump for president following an assassination attempt on the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\u201d Musk stated on X. He added, \u201cLast time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d\n\nAlong with Lonsdale, the Winklevoss twins, and the Crafts, the filing listed several other donors to America PAC, many of whom have close ties to Musk.\n\nBloomberg News previously reported that Musk had donated to America PAC, though the extent of his commitment had not been disclosed.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nElon Musk to contribute $45 million per month to pro-Trump super PAC - WSJ\n\nTrump picks JD Vance as his running mate\n\nUS Senator Rubio, North Dakota Governor Burgum will not be Trump's running mate, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Indonesia's massive metals build-out is felling the forest for batteries",
        "content": "LELILEF SAWAI, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 On a steep trek up to his forest farm on the Indonesian island of Halmahera, Librek Loha let out a cry of dismay. \u201cAduuuuh,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off.\n\n\u201cLandslides, again. They happen all the time now.\u201d\n\nThe mudslide below Loha\u00b4s plantings of cacao, nutmeg and pineapple have exposed more orange, rocky soil \u2014 adding to miles of bulldozed forest and river that are leaving the farm an island of green amid red-brown. Where trees once grew, there are dusty warehouses, mountains of black coal and water that runs silty brown.\n\nThis region of Weda Bay is now one of the world\u2019s largest nickel production facilities. Fiery smelters and multiple coal-fired power plants burn nonstop to refine nickel ore into material for batteries and steel.\n\nIndonesia aims to dominate the world\u2019s nickel supply, and it\u2019s succeeding. The country has gone from having two nickel smelters to 27 over the last 10 years, with 22 more planned, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Last year, the country was responsible for more than half the supply of nickel ore globally. The metal was once known mainly for making stainless steel; now demand has skyrocketed as automakers like Tesla need it for electric vehicle batteries and companies that make larger batteries need it for clean electricity projects.\n\nBut where developers build out these vast nickel-processing plants, surrounding forest disappears twice as fast, according to a new analysis by the Indonesian nonprofit Auriga.\n\nIndonesia has the largest reserves of nickel in the world. Until recently, it mostly sold its nickel deposits \u2014 ore \u2014 raw. It didn't have the processing plants to refine the metal.\n\nThen 10 years ago, Indonesian officials decided the country should stop selling its resources so cheaply and instead refine them, to provide employment and fetch higher prices. A massive nickel buildout ensued. President Joko Widodo has bolstered this, co-locating nickel smelters with EV battery factories.\n\nIn addition to the new smelters, coal power plants have sprung up to serve the miles of new industrial parks. Surrounding villages can see the well-lit nickel works while they live through regular power outages.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s nickel ore lies in shallow deposits, easily accessible when the rainforest is cut down.\n\nThe new analysis of rainforest loss, based on government data, shows deforestation rose from an average of 33 square kilometers (about 13 square miles) around each smelter, to 63 square kilometers (about 24.5 square miles). If all 22 new plants are built, deforestation is likely to increase dramatically.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe damage to the environment is devastating,\u201d said Timer Manurung, chairman of Auriga. \u201cDeforestation has significantly increased ... rivers are polluted, mangroves are cut to develop smelter areas, coastal areas and coral are being damaged by the smelters.\u201d\n\nThe waste from coal power plants was another problem, he said. The Associated Press verified the methodology used in the Auriga report.\n\nA vast tropical archipelago, Indonesia is the world\u2019s third most rainforest-covered country, home to giant forest flowers and endangered orangutans and elephants.\n\nSince 1950, more than 740,000 square kilometers (more than 285,000 square miles) of Indonesian rainforest \u2014 an area twice the size of Germany \u2014 have been logged, burned or degraded, according to Global Forest Watch.\n\nIn Lelilef Sawai, the village now surrounded by the Weda Bay Industrial Park, the deforestation and its impact are evident. Loha, the farmer, has held out, refusing to sell the land he\u2019s tended for four decades. Now orange dust often covers his plants and clean water is scarce. The plants also grow more slowly, he said.\n\nFrom his land, he can hear construction and see bright orange sediment flow into the sea. Research shows landslides are far more likely in deforested areas.\n\nMax Sigoro, 54, a traditional hunter and farmer, echoes Loha. Bright lights and noise from construction repel the deer he used to hunt at night. He says he\u2019s lost nearly all his previous income since the industrial park's expansion.\n\nAbdullah Ambar, 61, says the sea near the project has become murky and he can\u2019t fish anymore; the fish are gone.\n\nPT Indonesia Weda Bay officials declined to be interviewed by the AP but the company said in statement it has planted more than 10 square kilometers (about 4 square miles) of new trees. The company plays an active role in supporting the living standards of local people, offering economic development, it said, and the industrial zone meets all environmental standards. The company said it strives to protect water and has launched coral and mangrove planting programs.\n\nComplaints from villagers at the Weda Bay project mirror those from communities near other smelter works across Indonesia, including a controversial industrial park  on the island of Borneo and other projects in North Maluku.\n\nPerhaps related to these complaints, the interest of some European companies in nickel from Indonesia may be cooling.\n\nIn recent weeks, the French mining company Eramet and German chemical giant BASF announced they were canceling plans to build a $2.6 billion nickel refinery. Eramet cited no reason, while BASF blamed changes in the global nickel market. The announcements came shortly after being contacted by the AP for this story.\n\nIndonesia has been wooing Tesla, which uses twice as much metal in its total production of batteries than the next highest auto competitor. The amount of nickel it used in 2023 was up a third over the year before. Only 13% came from Indonesia last year, but its 2023 impact report mentioned Indonesia 18 times and warned the country\u2019s nickel will be crucial.\n\nTesla did not respond to emailed questions asking about its use of nickel from Indonesia and deforestation.\n\nQuestions to Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources went unanswered.\n\nNickel-making doesn\u2019t have to be dirty. Using clean energy rather than coal goes a long way toward cleaning the air near nickel complexes. The cleanest operations produce emissions vastly below the industry average, according to a report by the nonprofit Transport and Environment last year. Automakers could do more to investigate where their nickel comes from, including using satellites, and ban nickel from deforested areas.\n\nBut for villagers like Loha, Sigoro and Ambar, the prosperity they were led to believe would come, has not come.\n\n\u201cNow our water is dirty and the fish and animals we hunt are gone,\" Ambar said. \"Where is the better life promised?\u201d\n\n___\n\nDavey reported from London and Fassett reported from San Francisco.

        "title": "Big Auto Eyes $2B in Govt Grants to Boost EV Production",
        "content": "The Biden administration is awarding nearly $2B in grants to General Motors (NYSE:GM), Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and other carmakers to help restart or expand electric vehicle manufacturing and assembly sites in eight states.\n\nThe Energy Department will issue grants totaling $1.7 billion to create or retain thousands of union jobs and support auto-based communities in the three presidential battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia as well Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nAccording to Biden, the grants-- paid for by the landmark IRA of 2022--will help deliver on Washington\u2019s commitment to ensure the future of the auto industry is made in America by American union workers.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cEven as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive--and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations,\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nLast week, GM announced it has received a $500 million federal grant to help the company convert an assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan to produce EVs. GM has already invested over $12 billion in its North American EV manufacturing and supply chain since 2020.\n\nRelated: Houthis Showcase Drone Boat as Another Merchant Ship Falls Victim\n\nThe grants were hotly contested, with the DoE revealing it received four times as many applicants as grant recipients. DoE says all projects that were awarded funding currently employ Americans working in union jobs in the U.S.\n\nThe selected projects will create more than 2,900 jobs and help ensure that about 15,000 union workers are retained across all 11 facilities, the White House has said. According to the DoE, the new grants complement $177 billion in private sector investment in EV and battery manufacturing since Biden took office.\n\nThe UAW has, however, warned that a too rapid transition from ICE to EVs could put thousands of jobs at risk in key states such as Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain has applauded the announcement, saying the grants and loans \"makes clear to employers that the EV transition must include strong union partnerships with the high pay and safety standards that generations of UAW members have fought for and won.\"\n\nImpact On Oil Demand\n\nWith the year at the midpoint, the\u00a0EV boom shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nStory continues\n\nEV sales globally have now hit 18% of all new vehicle sales, with BEV sales up by 14% YoY in April, while plugin hybrids jumped 51% YoY. A big driver of the EV megatrend is falling costs, with Tesla Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) most affordable model now $6,500 cheaper than its ICE peer, the cheapest BMW 3 Series, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Gartner has predicted that EVs will be cheaper to produce than ICE vehicles of the same size in only three years, thanks in large part to improvements in manufacturing methods with production costs dropping faster than battery costs.\n\n\u201cNew OEM incumbents want to heavily redefine the status quo in automotive. They brought new innovations that simplify production costs such as centralized vehicle architecture or the introduction of gigacastings that help reduce manufacturing cost and assembly time, which legacy automakers had no choice to adopt to survive, \u201dPedro Pacheco, vice president of research at Gartner, has said.\n\nRapid EV adoption has elicited dire predictions for the oil sector. Last year, Bloomberg predicted that global demand for road fuel will peak in 2027 at 49 million barrels per day driven by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, ever-improving fuel efficiency, and shared mobility. Just a week ago, British Oil & Gas giant BP Plc (NYSE:BP) predicted that global oil demand will peak next year while wind and solar capacity will continue to grow rapidly.\n\nIn its latest edition of its annual Energy Outlook, BP has published a study of the evolution of the global energy system to 2050.\u00a0 BP has modeled its predictions on two key scenarios: The Current Trajectory and Net Zero. BP has predicted that oil demand will peak by 2025 at around 102 million barrels per day (bpd) under both scenarios.\n\nHowever, the rate of decline thereafter will be determined primarily by the pace of falling oil use in road transport. In the Current Trajectory, BP sees oil consumption gradually declining over the second half of the outlook to around 75 million bpd in 2050. The drop is, however, much more pronounced in Net Zero, with demand falling somewhere between 25 million and 30 million bpd by 2050.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n\nU.S. Oil, Gas Drilling Activity Continues To Drop Suriname\u2019s Mega Oil Boom Is Back on Track Brent Tops $86 on Hopes of Fed Cut in September\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) ended the recent trading session at $252.64, demonstrating a +1.78% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.28%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.53%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.4%.\n\nShares of the electric car maker witnessed a gain of 39.45% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector with its gain of 16.54% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Tesla in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on July 23, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.62, reflecting a 31.87% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $25.13 billion, up 0.81% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $2.48 per share and a revenue of $98.42 billion, signifying shifts of -20.51% and +1.71%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Tesla. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.74% downward. Right now, Tesla possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Tesla is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 100.19. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.46, which means Tesla is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nAlso, we should mention that TSLA has a PEG ratio of 4.63. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Automotive - Domestic industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.18.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 174, placing it within the bottom 31% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Moonshot Stocks That Could Turn $5,000 Into $25,000",
        "content": "This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox,\u00a0click here.\n\nIn mid-2013, America moved into a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d economy phase, a time when growth finally became not too hot and not too cold. Unemployment from the 2007-08 financial crisis was receding, and the prior year\u2019s corporate cost cutting was submitting to a more sustainable way forward. Perhaps most importantly, consumers were beginning to regain confidence as the financial crisis faded into the rearview mirror.\n\n\u201cWe have all this hot air in Washington,\u201d David Blitzer, S&P Dow Jones Indices chairman, said in a CNBC interview at the time. \u201cBut the rest of the economy is growing reasonably well\u2026 And that\u2019s probably what\u2019s behind the stock market\u2019s good track record.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, things were good enough.\n\n2024 is quickly becoming another \u201cGoldilocks\u201d period for the economy. On Thursday, CPI data showed that inflation decelerated to 3%, from 3.3% a month earlier. Analysts expect GDP to rise at 2% this year, up from previous estimates of 1.5%. And though industrial output is slightly weaker than expected, it\u2019s easy to argue that we\u2019re finally in another period when the economy is not too hot and not too cold.\n\nThat\u2019s great news because \u201cGoldilocks\u201d moments are phenomenal times for buying moonshot stocks. Shares of fast-growing companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would more than double in 2013 \u2013 the last time we saw this \u201cGoldilocks\u201d phenomenon. Smaller firms like Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) rose as much as 750%.\n\nThat\u2019s because most moonshots need strong economies and permissive capital markets to survive. It\u2019s no surprise that the 2012-14 period saw a bump in initial public offerings (IPOs) and a rash of venture capital (VC) activity. When you have big ideas, it helps to have big money to grow them into even bigger businesses. And the best of these startups can make early investors an enormous amount of profit.\n\nThis week, our writers at InvestorPlace.com \u2013 our free news and analysis site \u2013 examine three of these moonshot stocks that they believe are at the cusp of the sorts of gains that could turn $5,000 into $25,000. Though some of these moonshots naturally might not survive (they are moonshots), the five-baggers that do could more than offset these losses.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) In this photo illustration, the Plug Power logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has long been a risky bet on the future of the renewable energy source known as green hydrogen. The company is unprofitable; in 2023 it burned through $1.8 billion of cash. It\u2019s also running out of time. Its most recent balance sheet shows just $173 million of cash and short-term investments on its books.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Plug Power also has enormous dreams to become America\u2019s first one-stop shop for green hydrogen\u2026 and it now has significant financial backing that extends beyond its balance sheets. In March, it signed an agreement with investment bank B. Riley to raise more equity. And in May, the firm received a $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to help build out six \u201chydrogen hubs\u201d across the country.\n\nThis week at InvestorPlace.com, Larry Ramer writes how these efforts are laying the groundwork to become very profitable in the long term:\n\nDeployments of the company\u2019s electrolyzers are rapidly ramping up. As a result, I believe that this business will generate huge profits over the long-term as its revenue surges and its costs drop.\n\n\u2026 Moreover, Plug is likely to benefit from Nikola\u2019s success, since the two firms announced a partnership in December 2022. With Plug becoming a leader in the green hydrogen boom, I believe that it is one of the best hydrogen fuel stocks to buy.\n\nNew InvestorPlace.com contributor Andy Kim also notes that Plug already has a strong first-mover advantage, making it one of the smartest hydrogen stocks to buy with $100:\n\nPlug Power is essentially the pioneer in bringing a commercialized hydrogen market in the country. Furthermore, the company has deployed more than 69,000 fuel cell systems and over 250 fueling stations. This makes Plug Power the company with the largest fuel cell infrastructure while it is also the world\u2019s largest buyer of liquid hydrogen.\n\nThat makes Plug Power either a company that will be worth billions in the future\u2026 or $0 if things don\u2019t work out. And our Goldilocks economy now means the prospect of a 5X return\u2026 or even 20X\u2026 now outweighs the risk of total loss. Plug Power will need a lot of capital to build its green hydrogen infrastructure, and today\u2019s economy is making it far easier to raise the cash.\n\nOppFi (OPFI) Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMocca\n\nOppFi (NYSE:OPFI) is a fintech firm that issues loans to low-credit consumers through community banks.\n\nIt\u2019s a surprisingly profitable business. Since 2018, the firm has faced only one year of operating losses. As Yiannis Zourmpanos writes this week at InvestorPlace.com, numbers are still pointing in the right direction:\n\nThe company demonstrated strong profitability metrics during Q1 2024. OppFi\u2019s Net income increased substantially by 157.8% year-over-year (YoY) to $10.1 million. Similarly, its adjusted net income grew by 127.8% annually to $8.8 million. This significant improvement in profitability points to effective cost management and operational edge despite a slight increase in total expenses. Synergistically, total expenses decreased as a percentage of top-line by 2.7% to 40.6% (excluding one-time expenses and add-backs), contributing to enhanced profitability.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast with other fintech lending firms. LendingClub (NYSE:LC) has lost money in 12 of the past 16 years, while privately held Prosper Marketplace has done the same in nine of the past 11 years.\n\nThat makes OppFi a potential five-bagger hiding in plain sight. The company has managed to learn enough about its customers to consistently write profitable loans, and demand for this service will only grow as rival lenders struggle to make money. Mild economic growth will also keep default rates lower than average, boosting OppFi\u2019s total profitability.\n\nOppFi also trades at a significant discount, giving it a 5x upside. Markets currently value the stock at under 7x earnings, and analysts expect profits to grow 18% this year and 7% the next. This gives shares a 3x-4x upside on re-rating alone. The high likelihood of rising earnings (from low default rates) increases the upside to 5x to 10x.\n\nOf course, as a moonshot, OppFi comes with significant risks.\n\nThe company specializes in high-interest loans, charging 155% APRs on average to low-credit consumers. Net charge-off rates (loans expected to be written off) also sit at 47.9% of revenue \u2013 a figure 10 times higher than usually seen at established credit card firms.\n\nStill, alternative lenders have long been a source of strong potential returns. Green Dot (NYSE:GDOT), a firm that issues debit cards for Americans without bank accounts, saw shares rise fivefold in the mid-2010s during the last \u201cGoldilocks\u201d period. And OppFi could do the same this cycle.\n\nOpen Text (OTEX) A colorful heap of software logos sits on top of a laptop keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIan Bezek writes this week at InvestorPlace.com about how shares of Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) are at shockingly low valuations. The Canadian-based software rollup trades at 7.4 times earnings, even though analysts expect revenues to rise 25% this year and for earnings to surge 27%.\n\nInvestors have assigned OTEX stock a low valuation, with shares currently going for just 8 times forward earnings. Some discount makes sense as Open Text is a complex firm and many of its software tools are legacy rather than cutting-edge products. Regardless, 8 times forward earnings is an awfully low price, and shares seem set for a solid recovery after their recent 30% pullback.\n\nThe company also has a good history of profitable acquisitions. Return on capital invested (ROIC) should hit 17% this year and rise to 25% by 2026, according to analyst estimates. And revenue gains are being driven by significant secular tailwinds in its core markets, which includes cloud services, customer support, and software licensing. As CEO Mark Barrenechea said in his third-quarter earnings call in May:\n\nOur strategy to accelerate cloud growth is working. We\u2019ve increased our R&D investment to an annualized $900 million or 16% of fiscal \u201924 revenue. This helped drive Enterprise Cloud bookings growth of 63% in Q2 and 53% in Q3. We\u2019ve increased our F \u201924 Enterprise Cloud bookings targets to 33% to 38% and we\u2019re confidently projecting 20% plus cloud bookings growth in both F\u201925 and beyond.\n\nTogether, that means Open Text could rise threefold on multiples expansion alone. According to a three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model, shares are worth roughly $100 without additional acquisitions. Additional bolt-ons will increase this value even further to the 5x to 8x return range, especially if mild economic growth continues and keeps capital flowing.\n\nThe AI Moonshot Game\n\nTwo Sundays ago, I wrote here about Stem (NYSE:STEM), a stock that could rise 20x in the next decade. People have begun to worry about the power consumption of AI, and Stem is finding itself at the right place, at the right time. Shares are already up double digits since that note.\n\nThe AI story is also powering other firms to prominence. In a special report for his flagship newsletter, Eric Fry notes how artificial intelligence is creating a new cohort of stocks that could surge 1,000% or more (go here to learn how to get that report). These companies are riding a once-in-a-generation megatrend and are succeeding at changing the world.\n\nThe best part is that we\u2019re still in the early innings of this AI surge. Imagine a world where artificial intelligence can be trusted to drive cars\u2026 report the news\u2026 or even perform brain surgery. And now think how far current AI models still need to go to create that reality.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear more from Eric \u2013 together with Louis Navellier and Luke Lango as well \u2013 about how AI will create a whole new world of moonshot opportunities. We\u2019re in the perfect \u201cGoldilocks\u201d economy to fund these projects. And now that the technology is starting to become ready for prime time, we can expect some incredible disruptions to come.\n\nWatch for a special announcement on that event soon. In fact, I\u2019ve spent the past couple of months working hard, helping Eric, Luke, and Louis put together that project\u2026 and I\u2019ll be taking the next two Sundays off from the Digest to concentrate on finishing that up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Auto Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Automobiles have been around for more than a century and are still at the core of our daily transportation, even as the industry constantly evolves. Automobiles are at the heart of current and future transportation, from traditional vehicles to hybrid cars to electric vehicles to flying cars in the air.\n\nThe year\u2019s first half proved to be a good start for the automobile industry. As demand for automobiles has increased, more investors are looking to buy automobile stocks.\n\nWhen everyone is actively looking for an auto stock to invest in, the market can soon get overly saturated. Before it does and this ideal period for auto investment goes away, investors should keep an eye out and find an undervalued auto stock. Thus, below are the three most undervalued auto stocks to buy in July 2024 that will bring investors a major fortune.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the past four consecutive years, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been the largest auto company in the world. Last year, it was the only automaker to sell over 10 million vehicles. It has dominated the Asia-Pacific for decades and is a close second manufacturer in the North American market after Ford (NYSE:F).\n\nIn the changing automobile market, Toyota has emphasized the importance of both hybrid and electric vehicles. While some of its competitors were quick to fully go electric or invest a hefty sum of money into EVs, Toyota\u2019s strategy has always prioritized hybrid models over fully electric vehicles. This unique policy gives Toyota an edge over other auto companies when pure electric vehicles struggle. Out of the 11.2 million vehicles Toyota sold in 2023, a third of its sales came from hybrid cars.\n\nIn addition to great sales and market dominance, Toyota is relatively undervalued, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.33x. Now is the perfect time for investors to buy Toyota.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is now the largest electric vehicle company globally, beating major competitors like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). It owns a little less than 20% of the industry\u2019s market share. This Chinese EV powerhouse has established itself as the cream of the crop with active delivery, consistent performance, and constant improvements.\n\nLast month, BYD recorded another all-time high performance. It sold 341,658 new energy vehicles (NEV), which is an outstanding 35% increase from the same period last year. Sales this June contributed to a larger all-time high in second-quarter sales. This was also a 40% increase in sales year over year. The company also sealed a major $1 billion deal to open an EV factory in Turkey, which will help BYD produce nearly 150,000 vehicles annually. In addition to its dominance in the Asia-Pacific market, deals like these show that BYD is constantly making efforts to expand beyond its domestic market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith such strong and consistent sales performance, BYD will continue to keep the top EV maker spot for an extended period of time, and now it is the cheapest price investors will be able to buy BYD.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors has been a top player in the auto industry since its founding in 1908.\n\nIn April, GM authorized a $6 billion share repurchase, another major stock buyback authorization after the $10 billion authorization in November 2023. In addition, the automobile company increased its dividend payment by 33% from 9 cents to 12 cents per share.\n\nAdditionally, GM\u2019s 2024 second-quarter sales were impressive. It sold almost 700,000 vehicles, GM\u2019s highest quarterly sales record since 2024.\n\nWhile EVs only make up less than 4% of all auto sales for GM, its EV sales are up by 40% compared to the previous quarter, a positive indication that GM is adapting to the global shift toward electric vehicles.\n\nFor those looking for an undervalued auto stock, GM is an excellent choice. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is 5.04x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Tesla and Rivian Stocks Went in Opposite Directions Today",
        "content": "U.S.-based electric-vehicle (EV) stocks have had a great past month. Shares of Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), Rivian Automotive(NASDAQ: RIVN), and Lucid Group(NASDAQ: LCID) are each higher by between about 50% and 60% in that time. There have been company-specific reasons for each of those moves.\n\nToday, however, Tesla's stock jumped by as much as 7%, while Rivian and Lucid stocks are sinking. As of 1:15 p.m. ET, Tesla shares were up by 5%, Rivian was lower by 3.2%, and Lucid had plunged by 12.7%.\n\nA changing political landscape that could be less friendly to EV makers is one reason for today's moves lower. But Tesla investors realize that the company may be better able to navigate those macro winds, especially after CEO Elon Musk made his views public this weekend.\n\nTesla's Elon Musk jumps into the fray\n\nWith the backdrop of the Republican convention beginning today, analysts see voters swinging more toward the Republican candidate after President Biden's poor performance in the recent debate and the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump this weekend.\n\nBut Trump has expressed that he intends to repeal the existing EV-purchase tax credits that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act. That helps explain why Rivian and Lucid have been giving back recent stock gains today. Rivian shares had been rising since last month when global automaker Volkswagen said it would invest up to $5 billion over two years in the EV start-up.\n\nMeanwhile, investors also have rewarded Lucid for its announcement that its nearly 2,400 second-quarter luxury-EV deliveries jumped by more than 20% versus the first quarter and over 70%, compared to the prior year period.\n\nBut the moves higher in those stocks took a pause today as the momentum for a Trump election victory took hold in the markets. Meanwhile, Tesla shares jumped after Elon Musk publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president. The stock is also recovering some losses from last week after reports of a potential delay in Tesla's planned Aug. 8 Robotaxi update.\n\nEV investors need to think long term\n\nRegardless of the political swings and recent events, EV investors should still be looking at the long-term prospects of the companies and the industry, in general. That means that potential changes in the landscape notwithstanding, investors should be watching for what Tesla has to say when it reports second-quarter earnings next Tuesday, July 23. After delivering about 444,000 EVs in the second quarter, the company will discuss whether it can accelerate sales in the second half of 2024 to match the 1.81 million vehicles it delivered in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond that, the update on Tesla's self-driving technology will be important when it officially reveals the Robotaxi after the earnings report. Rivian and Lucid investors will want to see their companies' quarterly updates, as well, scheduled for Aug. 6 and Aug. 5, respectively.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "As good as the S&P 500 is performing in 2024, the Nasdaq 100 is doing even better. The tech-oriented index is up 23% this year, compared to an 19% gain by the benchmark index.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising the Nasdaq is doing so well. Because it is a modified market cap-weighted index, bigger companies have a larger impact on its performance.\n\nThe biggest six stocks are all worth more than $1 trillion dollars, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) the seventh largest, is within striking distance at just under $900 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means the Magnificent Seven stocks from last year all have an outsized say in how well the index is doing this year. Considering all but the electric vehicle manufacturer are up by double-digit percentages \u2014 in fact, they are up by 20% or more \u2014 it may be more remarkable that the Nasdaq 100 isn\u2019t up even more.\n\nIt also means finding undervalued Nasdaq 100 stocks isn\u2019t easy. Some 60% of all index components are in the green but not all are doing better than the index itself.\n\nWith only a quarter of the components doing as well or better, it suggests there are still quite a few discounted stocks to buy. Below are three that deserve a closer look by investors.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR) The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nCable and telecom provider Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is one of those laggards. Shares are down almost 20% in 2024 but is is poised for a turnaround.\n\nThe ending of the Affordable Connectivity Program on June 1 weighed heavily on Charter\u2019s performance. The federal program offered a $30 subsidy to make broadband more affordable for households and fully 16% of Charter\u2019s customers, some 5 million households, benefited from the program.\n\nAs the second-largest cable provider in the U.S., Charter is still driving market share gains and strong, recurring cash flows by limiting price increases on its services. Because it operates at scale, it can improve cost efficiency that will flow through to its bottom line.\n\nWhile holding the line on pricing can attract customers with little loyalty, since Charter upgraded its network to meet the demands of its customers\u2019 broadband needs \u2014 even more so than telecom providers like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) \u2014 it gives the company competitive advantages over the competition.\n\nAs the ACP wind down recedes further in the rearview mirror, and with lower inflation Charter raises prices, expect margins to improve and CHTR stock to grow.\n\nThe telecom and wireless provider trades at 9 times trailing earnings and estimates, goes for a fraction of its sales and 15 times its free cash flow. It makes Charter Communications an undervalued Nasdaq 100 stock worthy of consideration.\n\nStory continues\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDrug-maker Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) also is having a rough go of it this year. Shares are down 15% year-to-date as competitive pressures mount against its oncology portfolio.\n\nTrodelvy, for example, is used to treat rare, \u201ctriple-negative\u201d breast tumors and was approved to treat more common metastatic breast cancers that met certain conditions. However, Enhertu from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo (OTCMKTS:DSNKY) showed greater promise.\n\nStill, Gilead has a strong pipeline of drugs for HIV and Hepatitis C HIV therapy sales rose 4% in the fourth quarter to $4.3 billion while liver disease treatments jumped 9% to $737 million. The market for HIV treatment is growing at low-single-digit rates but prevention therapies are rising at double-digit rates. That provides a strong catalyst for growth for the biopharmaceutical.\n\nGilead Sciences stock trades at 9x next year\u2019s earnings and at just 10 times FCF. Earnings are expected to nearly double next year, making the drugmaker a good candidate for an undervalued Nasdaq 100 stock to buy now.\n\nCostco (COST) A photo of a Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) seemingly doesn\u2019t fit the bill as a discounted stock. Its shares are up 30% year-to-date and over 53% higher for the past 12 months. Those are growth stock-type numbers, not value stock. Yet Costco is a company simply running ahead of its valuation. There is significantly more runway for the warehouse club to take off.\n\nMost notable is its just-released announcement that it will be raising its membership fees by $5 to $65. Executive memberships will rise $10 and go from $120 to $130. This long-awaited development will provide an immediate boost to Costco\u2019s topline numbers and will readily flow through its income statement to the bottom line.\n\nMemberships are where the retailer derives the greatest portion of its profits. They essentially cost it nothing and immediately boost profits. Because of the discounts shoppers receive on the bulk item purchases they make, the modest increase in fees is not a deterrent. It will lose few if any members because of the hike. It is something Costco does every five or six years on average.\n\nBecause of inflation and the impact its had on households, Costco has refrained from raising its membership fee for seven years. Despite the significant share price gains the wholesale club has enjoyed, shares still trade at less than twice sales making it the third undervalued Nasdaq 100 stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 stocks grew 46% in the last 5 years. How much longer does the term have to run?",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett popularized the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d as a stock term just over a year ago. The movie-inspired moniker refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, which accounted for half of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Like the acronym FAANG before it, the \"Magnificent Seven\" has served as a strategy for some investors\u2014raising the question of how much longer this particular basket of stocks will have an outsize influence.\n\nWhether the term\u2014a reference to an acclaimed 1960 western that Hartnett used in a May 2023 note to investors\u2014has outgrown its relevance is up for debate. What\u2019s not is that shareholders have been rewarded with a combined annualized return of over 46% in the last five years, compared to just over 13% for the S&P.\n\nAngelo Zino of CFRA Research said he expects the earnings trajectory of these seven names to continue to outperform the market over the next decade.\n\n\u201cThey're what we view as growth at a reasonable price,\u201d Zino said.\n\nThose high-quality earnings, Zino said, have been especially attractive in a high-interest rate environment, even before the artificial intelligence boom captivated markets.\n\nThe struggles of some members of the Magnificent Seven (particularly Tesla) early in 2024, fears of overconcentration risk, and the emergence of other players in the AI race, however, have analysts like Baird\u2019s Ted Mortonson questioning whether the phrase should remain in fashion.\n\n\u201cTalking about just the Magnificent Seven, you're missing a large swath of other names that could compound returns pretty aggressively in the next two to three years,\u201d he said.\n\nMagnificent Seven present both AI opportunity and defensive play\n\nThe importance of large-cap stocks to the market is not a new phenomenon. A January report from Vanguard found that out of thousands of stocks, only 72 had accounted for half of the market\u2019s total returns since 1926. The trend held even when excluding the explosion of mega-cap tech growth that has inspired several acronyms over the last decade.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer popularized the term FANG (for Facebook parent Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet) in 2013. Eventually, a second A was included to include Apple.\n\nThat term would eventually give way to the Magnificent Seven, a gorup of companies who boast a combined market capitalization of over $16 trillion and loom large in not just the markets but daily life. All seven companies, Zino said, have massive ecosystems that will presumably become only easier to monetize in the age of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThese are names that each one of us use to some capacity every single day of our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThis visibility helps makes these stocks a relative safety net for investors, Zino said. In a market plagued by election fears and geopolitical risks, Mortonson explained, institutional investors demand names sporting massive free cash flows.\n\n\u201cThey're almost becoming somewhat defensive plays in a down market just because they are so profitable and dominant,\u201d Mortonson said.\n\nTech behemoths maintain long-term relevance\n\nThe struggles of Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet early in 2024 led some analysts to start dubbing the other four big tech stocks the \u201cFab Four,\u201d though shares of Apple and Alphabet recovered to outpace the S&P, while a recent Tesla rally virtually erased its year-to-date losses. Bank of America analysts expect growth to broaden out as second-quarter earnings get underway.\n\nIn the near term, Zino believes the sharp outperformance of the Magnificent Seven could cool down as some fund managers reallocate their positions to more value-oriented areas that have underperformed. That doesn\u2019t mean he thinks these companies are going anywhere, particularly in the age of AI.\n\n\u201cWe're hard pressed to think that these [Magnificent Seven] names aren't going to be among the biggest winners out there,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 AI Stocks Ready to Come Out of the Shadows and Shine",
        "content": "Investors are increasingly drawn to hot AI stocks amid rapid industry innovation and market growth. The overall AI space is predicted to soar from a $196.6 billion market in 2023 to more than $1.8 trillion by 2030. Accordingly, investors looking to capitalize on the growth of AI are increasingly looking at a wide range of sectors such as automotive, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Identifying undervalued AI stocks early is key to maximizing investment potential.\n\nAI has rapidly emerged as a leading industry, which is poised for substantial long-term growth. With numerous companies integrating AI, now is an opportune moment to invest in promising AI stocks. However, selecting top contenders is challenging due to the industry\u2019s infancy and evolving landscape. Thus, investors navigating AI stocks must carefully identify future industry leaders.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Symbotic (SYM) Short-Squeeze Stocks\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) excels in warehouse robotics and AI, achieving robust Q2 2024 sales of $424 million. Importantly, Symbotic\u2019s revenue growth rate has remained in the high doubled digits, supposed by recent deployments of three new systems and upgrades for existing operational ones. These moves have enhanced the company\u2019s capacity and efficiency with advanced algorithms and AI chips. This positions Symbotic as a breakout stock, driven by rapid growth and technological innovation in logistics automation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as its major customer, Symbotic has a relatively stable long-term growth trajectory. Currently, Walmart drives about 90% of its $1.339 billion revenue last year. While there is some risk with customer concentration that should be considered, it\u2019s clear Symbotic\u2019s core technology is in high demand. Notably, Symbotic also recently launched Greenbox, a service module, through a $7.5 billion joint venture with SoftBank. Future launches should further bolster the company\u2019s growth prospects moving forward.\n\nSymbotic is positioned to lead in blue-collar industries amid the AI wave, targeting a vast market. In Q2, the company enhanced efficiency with new routing algorithms and AI chips, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations significantly. Growth catalysts include a new solutions and a logistics service deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, suggesting strong future growth potential.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a top semiconductor maker demanding a very high multiple in the world of chip makers. In fact, on a trailing basis, AMD\u2019s price earnings multiple is higher than that of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a shocking concept for many investors looking exposure to AI-related chip makers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome analysts have cited limited AI growth potential for AMD, preferring its competitors. However, the company\u2019s new Ryzen\u2122 processors with Neural Processing Units target AI applications, alongside projections to secure a $15 billion share in the data center GPU market, support buy ratings form analysts at Citi (NYSE:C) that have issued a buy rating and a $176 price target on AMD stock.\n\nIn current news, AMD announced it has acquired Silo AI, Europe\u2019s largest private AI lab, for about $665 million in cash. This move strengthens AMD\u2019s AI strategy with Silo AI\u2019s renowned team of scientists and engineers specializing in custom AI models and solutions across cloud, embedded, and endpoint computing. Silo AI CEO Peter Sarlin will lead the team under AMD\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Group, aiming to enhance AI solutions on AMD platforms. The acquisition is set to finalize in the latter half of 2024, supporting AMD\u2019s goal to rapidly deploy advanced AI solutions worldwide.\n\nAMD\u2019s stock surged 153% from early 2023, driven by aggressive AI initiatives in response to Nvidia\u2019s industry dominance. AMD has launched a number of competitive chips, securing mega-cap tech clients along the way. Shifting to annual chip releases, AMD unveiled the MI325X following the MI300X AI accelerator. Although there are bigger competitors like Nvidia who holds almost 95% of the market, AMD still holds strong growth potential in the world of AI.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoining recently the trillion-dollar club, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) shows resilience and underscores the impact of AI in the chip sector. The company has now surpassed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the seventh most valuable tech company. Other major tech giants have also hit record highs, with rankings continuing to fluctuate, which will remain the case moving forward.\n\nCFRA analyst Angelo Zino highlighted that the semiconductor sector became the top industry in the S&P 500 in recent remarks, reflecting significant global shifts over the past 15 to 18 months. This surge, driven by soaring demand for chips amid the growth of generative AI, suggests ongoing industry expansion.\n\nTSM saw Q1 gross margin rise to 53.1%, boosted by favorable product mix changes. Operating margin improved to 42%, driven by stringent expense controls. The company\u2019s Q1 EPS hit TWD8.7 with a solid 25.4% return on equity, reflecting strong profitability. TSMC plans $28-32 billion in 2024 CapEx, focusing on advanced technologies and global expansion with new fabs in Arizona, Japan, and Europe, to meet rising AI market demands efficiently.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA): \u2018This Thing Has a Lot of Momentum\u2019",
        "content": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Says You Should Buy These 10 Stocks. Since Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer last week talked about the decline of tech stocks after the latest CPI report, saying investors \u201cabandoned\u201d tech stocks like \u201crats from the sinking ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was titanic! They took their money and went all in on small and medium-sized companies we call the Russell 2000 because we got a much softer than expected consumer price index.\u201d\n\nCramer said that the latest CPI number shows inflation \u201chas been beaten\u201d and interest rates are \u201ccoming down.\u201d The CNBC host said if we keep getting positive data, he won\u2019t be surprised to see not one but two or three rate cuts this year.\n\nCramer wondered how major tech companies could fall on the low inflation numbers, and answered his own question by saying that sometimes in the backdrop of lower bond yields stocks of companies that \u201cneed lower rates\u201d can suddenly rise.\n\n\u201cWhat happened today always happens when rates plunged,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that there isn\u2019t enough positive data available yet to keep supporting this rally of stocks that benefit from lower rates, adding that such short-term rallies last for about three days. Cramer predicted that big tech stocks will be back after a \u201cfew more plunging days.\u201d\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s bullish on. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Jim Cramer Say You Should Buy Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nCramer thinks Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the potential to join the $1 trillion \u201cclub.\u201d He said the company just needs to demonstrate that Tesla Energy could be a bigger piece of its business. Cramer said Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle sales are \u201cleveling off\u201d after a period of decline, while its self-driving projects like robo taxis could be \u201cthe biggest thing going.\u201d Cramer said China could be a big market for robo taxis.\n\n\u201cThis thing got a lot of momentum.\u201d\n\nTesla shares recently plunged after the company postponed its much-awaited robo taxi event until October. However, Tesla bulls say their core thesis remains unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nCathie Wood recently set a $2600 price target on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) for 2029, which present a whopping 1300% upside potential from the current levels. Wood thinks the robo taxi project has the potential to deliver $8 to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nHowever, many believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) won\u2019t be able to live up to the hype around its robo taxi plans. Each robo taxi is expected to have a price target of around $150K to $200K, with some estimates suggesting Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) would need about $35 billion to develop a global feet of such cars. Amid inflation and lack of preference for electric cars, American families will probably stay away from spending a fortune on robo taxis, which could cause a blow to Tesla Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans in the future.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. In our view, Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results, where revenues and earnings missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Weaker-than-expected automotive revenues were partly driven by a reduced average selling price, which was down 15% year-over-year. Moreover, management decided to forgo providing volume guidance, though they did acknowledge they are in a lower growth phase given the uncertain consumer environment particularly as it relates to high ticket purchases.\u201d\n\nOverall, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer Says You Should Buy These 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "When it comes to investing in growth stocks, a long-term mindset can be a lucrative advantage. Peering further into the future can enable you to position your portfolio for fortune-building gains. Here are two businesses with excellent long-term expansion prospects that could make you richer in the coming years.\n\nGrowth stock to buy No. 1: Eli Lilly\n\nMillions of people around the world want to look and feel better. Eli Lilly's (NYSE: LLY) blockbuster new weight-loss drug is helping people do that and more while delivering hefty profits to investors.\n\nZepbound, the healthcare giant's weight-management treatment for adults, could be a game changer for the nearly 70% of American adults who are obese or overweight. These weight-related conditions put people at higher risk for diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes.\n\nZepbound makes it easier to eat less food by curbing hunger. A 72-week clinical study showed that people who took the highest dose of the drug shed an average of 48 pounds. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, has also been shown to improve cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels in adults.\n\nWith so many potential benefits, sales of Zepbound are set to soar. Goldman Sachs predicts that Eli Lilly will capture the lion's share of an obesity drug market that could reach $130 billion by 2030. Analysts, in turn, expect Eli Lilly to grow its earnings per share by a stunning 63% annually over the next five years.\n\nGrowth stock to buy No. 2: Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is another top-tier company with leading positions in booming markets. The electric vehicle (EV) leader also has intriguing expansion potential in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.\n\nThe EV industry will top $950 billion by the end of the decade, up from roughly $388 billion in 2023, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Tesla clearly still has a long runway for growth in its core EV segment.\n\nTesla is also a frontrunner in the autonomous vehicle race. Cutting-edge AI powers its rapidly improving self-driving technology. With millions of vehicles on the road, the EV pioneer has a powerful data-collection advantage over rivals like Alphabet's Waymo. Tesla's Autopilot software is thus in a strong position to achieve full self-driving capabilities before its competitors.\n\nCEO Elon Musk wants to use this technology to build a fleet of robotaxis. Tesla is developing a new autonomous vehicle dubbed Cybercab as part of its ambitious plan to revolutionize the ride-hailing industry. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest estimates that Tesla's driverless car initiative could produce revenue of more than $600 billion by 2029 -- and drive its stock price up tenfold to $2,600 per share by that time.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncredibly, Tesla may have an even more potent growth driver in AI-powered robots. The tech titan is building a sci-fi-like humanoid robot called Optimus. Tesla's bot is intended to bolster productivity and ease labor shortages in factories and other settings by taking on tasks that are dangerous or monotonous for humans. Musk sees an enormous array of possible use cases for the company's robots. So many, in fact, that he pegs Tesla's long-term profit opportunity at a staggering $1 trillion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks to Buy as Musk Teases Tesla Bot",
        "content": "No stranger to chronically optimistic claims, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has been making waves recently regarding the role that humanoid robots can play in the broader economy. At the electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Musk stated that such robots could lift TSLA\u2019s market capitalization to $25 trillion. If so, it may be a good idea to consider robotics stocks to buy.\n\nI\u2019m going to be skeptical about the $25 trillion claim. However, the robotics ecosystem itself stands as one of the most relevant in the broader tech sphere. According to Precedence Research, the sector worldwide enjoyed a valuation of $72.17 billion in 2022. By 2032, the space could be worth $283.19 billions, implying a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7%.\n\nEven better, the canvas offers a diverse set of opportunities for investors. It\u2019s not just about focusing on the robots themselves but the various software and hardware that makes such innovations possible. With that in mind, below are compelling robotics stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nA global leader in industrial automation and information technology, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) provides hardware and software solutions that help companies optimize their manufacturing processes through various digitalization solutions. Fundamentally, Rockwell can leverage its expertise in industrial automation, bringing about net productivity gains for enterprises.\n\nNow, it should be noted that analysts aren\u2019t exactly keen on ROK stock at the moment. Notably, shares have lost more than 10% of equity value since the beginning of the year. Further, in the past four quarters, the company printed an average earnings per share of $2.80. This unfortunately missed the average consensus target of $2.86, translating to a negative earnings surprise of 1.63%.\n\nHowever, there is some good news here and that\u2019s the valuation. Shares trade at 26X trailing-year earnings and 3.4X trailing-year sales. But between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the metrics stood at 27.55X and 4.08X, respectively.\n\nAnalysts anticipate rough waters throughout fiscal 2024. By 2025, however, EPS could jump 18.33% to $12.01. Sales could rise to $9.09 billion, up 5.7%. It\u2019s one of the robotics stocks to consider.\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nBased in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) falls under the communication equipment industry. It provides enterprise asset intelligence solutions in the automatic identification and data capture industries. Thanks to its vast acumen, Zebra is relevant for multiple applications, including mobile computing and RFID technology. Because advanced robots need to track various protocols in real time, Zebra can complement autonomous systems for enhanced productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat makes the company stand out is the underlying financial performance. While not remarkable, it quietly gets the job done. In the past four quarters, Zebra\u2019s average EPS came out to $2.18. This beat the average analysts\u2019 consensus view of $2.05, translating to an earnings surprise of almost 7%.\n\nHowever, it must be said that the extra performance has translated to a valuation premium. Specifically, shares trade at 3.85X sales. That\u2019s a bit higher than the prior year\u2019s average multiple of 2.8X.\n\nStill, it\u2019s encouraging that analysts anticipate EPS growth of 22% to $11.97. For the top line, they\u2019re looking at sales of $4.77 billion, up 4.2%. Sales could move up another 7.5% to $5.13 billion next year, making ZBRA one of the robotics stocks to consider.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the semiconductor equipment and materials industry, Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) is one of the most important players among robotics stocks. Per its public profile, Teradyne designs, develops, manufactures and sells automated test systems and robotic products worldwide. Its automated solutions are deployed in the manufacturing field for tasks that require both flexibility and safety.\n\nEssentially, Teradyne isn\u2019t about creating a rival invention to the wheel; rather, it\u2019s taking the wheel that we already have and making it that much better and thereby more economically productive. One of the clear advantages of investing in TER stock is the underlying financials. In the trailing year, Teradyne\u2019s average EPS hit 72 cents, beating the consensus view of 61 cents.\n\nTo be fair, such a grand performance comes at the cost of valuation premiums. Right now, shares trade at 60.5X earnings and almost 10X sales. In the past year, the metrics sat at 30X and 6.25X, respectively.\n\nStill, analysts see progressive growth in fiscal 2024 and especially 2025. By the latter, EPS could rise to $4.83 while the top line could swing up to $3.4 billion. That\u2019s a significant improvement over 2023\u2019s results of $3.11 and $2.68 billion, respectively.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wells Fargo remains bearish on Tesla stock, sees more than 50% downside risk",
        "content": "Wells Fargo analysts said they retain a pessimistic outlook on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, reiterating an Underweight rating and the price target of $120, which implies a possible downside of more than 50% from current levels.\n\nTesla stock climbed roughly 40% over the past month, \u201cmostly driven by \u2018razzle-dazzle\u2019 headlines,\u201d analysts noted, but fundamentals remain weak.\n\n\u201cWe suspect a largely retail-driven rally has squeezed out shorts and forced long-only rebalancing. However, infatuated investors ignore the warning signs,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts wrote.\n\nDespite the positive news, Q2 deliveries were still down 5% year-over-year, likely bolstered by financing promotions of up to $5K. Moreover, the anticipated robotaxi reveal has been delayed to October. Even more troubling is the $9,000 tariff risk on Model 3s in Europe, Wells Fargo highlighted.\n\nAnalysts said Tesla's recent rally has been fueled by several positive developments, including beating Q2 delivery estimates, the approval of Elon's $56 billion pay package, FSD testing in China, the deployment of Optimus, and robotaxi hype.\n\n\"That said, we suspect technical factors likely exacerbated the move.\" Short positions were likely covered, Tesla stock appears under-owned by mutual funds prompting some rebalancing, and retail interest surged to about 48% of the shareholder base, the investment firm highlighted.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tesla Energy story is promising, Wells Fargo acknowledged, with the company reporting a record 9.4 MWh of energy storage deployed in Q2, more than double the previous quarter. This is Tesla's highest-margin business, with over 20% gross margin in the last three quarters, leading analysts to raise FY24 Energy Gen sales estimates by ~50%.\n\nHowever, this business \"can be lumpy since it is largely project-based,\u201d analysts cautioned.\n\nQ2's deployments, annualized at ~38 GWh, are close to the reported 40 GWh maximum capacity after adding a second shift post-Q1. Also, the solar segment has been shrinking, they added.\n\nFurthermore, investors have largely ignored the impact of new US and EU tariffs, according to analysts. Biden's EV battery tariffs will add around $1,000 to the cost of the US Model 3 SR, while EU tariffs on Chinese EVs will add approximately 20.8%, or about $9,000, to the EU Model 3 from China, significantly more than the $1,600 price increase.\n\nThese tariffs are estimated to add $600 million in costs for FY24 and around $1.2 billion for FY25. Additionally, the Chevron (NYSE:CVX) deference ruling poses a risk to Tesla if US regulations are eased, reducing EV credit values.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We also see a Trump win as a risk to TSLA given [the] risk to IRA benefits,\u201d analysts added.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Wells Fargo analysts have raised their Q2 2024E estimate from $0.41 to $0.50, reflecting leverage on higher deliveries and Energy&Storage strength, partially offset by price cuts. Conversely, the FY24E EPS has been lowered from $1.75 to $1.60 due to added costs from US and EU tariffs, assuming flat pricing for the remainder of the year. EPS estimates for 2025-2028 have also been reduced to account for the increase in EU tariffs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWells Fargo remains bearish on Tesla stock, sees more than 50% downside risk\n\nCiti sees 'no major change to trading views into election' after Trump shooting\n\nGoldman Sachs earnings beat by $0.26, revenue topped estimates\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran. Since Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\n\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Best AI Value Stock That is \u2018Money Machine\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nTesla is one of the notable companies in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks which according to Aswath Damodaran\u00a0 have become money machine value stocks.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a forward P/E of 102 while its 14-day RSI value is 85, worse than 99% of 1342 companies in the Vehicles & Parts industry, according to data from GuruFocus.\n\nHowever, some Wall Street analysts believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0is undervalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nCathie Wood recently set a $2600 price target on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0for 2029, which present a whopping 1300% upside potential from the current levels. Wood thinks the robotaxi project has the potential to deliver\u00a0$8 to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nHowever, many believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0won\u2019t be able to live up to the hype around its robotaxi plans. Each robotaxi is expected to have a price target of around $150K to $200K, with some estimates suggesting Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0would need about $35 billion to develop a global feet of such cars. Amid inflation and lack of preference for electric cars, American families will probably stay away from spending a fortune on robotaxis, which could cause a blow to Tesla Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0plans in the future.\n\nBaron Partners Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the Fund\u2019s underperformance this quarter stemmed from the Fund\u2019s 10-year investment in\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla\u2019s shares fell 29.3% during the period and detracted 13.41% from the Fund\u2019s first quarter results. Although Tesla has contributed importantly to the Fund\u2019s performance since 2014, on occasion it has detracted from quarterly performance. In previous instances when Tesla shares have underperformed during a discrete period, they have shortly afterwards reflected the strong growth of the underlying business and the stock has appreciated considerably. We believe that will be the case again, although cannot guarantee it.\n\nA significant decline also occurred at the end of 2022. In that instance, investors had become concerned about a host of external factors. Investors believed the company founder, visionary, and CEO Elon Musk was distracted by his acquisition of Twitter. They also believed a weak Chinese economy emerging from COVID and U.S. government policies would curtail the purchases of Tesla vehicles. These fears proved to be overblown. As the company achieved milestones in the succeeding year, the stock subsequently doubled over the next 12 months.\n\nOverall, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

As he was taken away, footage showed blood on his face.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said the police department was sending more officers to certain sites, including Trump Tower, the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street, Foley Square and City Hall.\n\nIan Bremmer, president of political risk research and consulting firm Eurasia Group, tweeted, \"former president trump shot at rally. us democracy in crisis.\"\n\nHe added later, \"political violence was abhorrent and completely unjustified on january 6. it\u2019s equally abhorrent and completely unjustified on july 13.\"\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers condemned political violence and expressed relief that Trump is safe.\n\nIn a statement, President Joe Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Biden Vs. Trump: Elon Musk Reportedly Donates 'Sizable Amount' To Ex-President's Campaign, Expert Calls It 'Big Evolution For Their Relationship'\n\nTesla Inc. CEO and billionaire Elon Musk has reportedly made a significant donation to a super political action committee (PAC) supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhat Happened: Musk has made a contribution to the low-profile America PAC. The exact amount remains undisclosed but is described as a \u201csizable amount,\u201d reported Bloomberg. The PAC is set to disclose its list of donors on July 15.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nThis contribution marks a shift for Musk, who has previously identified as a political independent and expressed a preference for staying out of politics. His support for Trump\u2019s campaign could potentially influence the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOther Republican billionaires, Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, who have previously criticized Trump, are also in discussions about possible donations to his campaign. However, no commitments or decisions have been made yet.\n\nTim Higgins, author of \"Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century,\"\u00a0underscored the importance of Musk\u2019s donation, stating that this does show the Tesla CEO does not support Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIt would be a big evolution for their relationship. Maybe he\u2019s supporting Trump, but he really doesn\u2019t support Biden,\u201d he told CNBC in an interview.\n\nMusk\u2019s donation comes at a crucial time for Trump\u2019s campaign, which has recently surpassed President Joe Biden\u2019s in fundraising, thanks to the support of wealthy Wall Street and corporate donors.\n\nSee Also: Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100\n\nThe America PAC is primarily working behind the scenes to strengthen Trump\u2019s campaign. Musk\u2019s contribution could provide a significant boost to the Republicans, giving them a major cash advantage in what is shaping up to be the most expensive presidential election in U.S. history.\n\nMusk, whose wealth primarily comes from his holdings in Tesla Inc., has not yet commented on the matter.\n\nWhy It Matters: Musk\u2019s donation is a significant departure from his previous stance. In March 2024, he stated that he would not be financially supporting either Trump or Biden.\n\nHowever, Musk\u2019s interactions with Trump have been increasing, as revealed in a June shareholder meeting, where he disclosed that Trump often calls him \"out of the blue.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk has also been critical of the Biden administration, responding to a comment about who\u2019s running the country with a cryptic \u201cmaybe nobody.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Musk revealed that Trump is a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, indicating a shared interest in electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the race between Trump and Biden is close, a recent poll has given an edge to the former president, who leads Biden 44% to 42%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a lot simpler.

Then again, these companies have been the source of most of the market\u2019s earnings growth in recent quarters.\n\nBut there\u2019s always more to the story in markets.\n\nIn a note this week, DataTrek\u2019s Nicholas Colas wrote about how these numbers, while useful, can be broken down further by looking at how much of a stock\u2019s valuation comes from present earnings and how much comes from what is essentially an analytics version of hopes and dreams.\n\nColas calculates that around 45% of the valuation of the S&P 500 as a whole comes from current earnings, with the rest coming from the historically backed optimism that earnings will continue to grow.\n\nAnd if Tesla is simply more expensive than its Mag Seven peers, it's in a different stratosphere compared to its automaker peers, with GM and Ford trading at 5.1x and 6.5x next year\u2019s earnings, respectively. The legacy automakers' discount to the market is due to concerns about how well they\u2019d fare in a downturn.\n\n\u201cAnd then we get to Tesla, where 91% of its valuation is based on future earnings growth,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cThat tells us this is a faith-based stock rather than one whose valuation is grounded in near-term fundamentals.\u201d\n\nWith expectations for future earnings so high, it\u2019s obvious that investors are banking on its robotaxi thesis as a paradigm shift for the company \u2014 and likely not the only shift to come.\n\nBut we\u2019d also be wise to use care when it comes to valuations.\n\nCaveats that accompany pronouncements about what\u2019s over- and undervalued often don\u2019t really matter. In the aggregate, valuation norms are more likely to hold over time: The S&P 500\u2019s average forward P/E is around 19x. In the specific, the range of outcomes is much wider.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll-time highs often follow all-time highs, and history is littered with both the losses and missed gains of investors who placed too much weight on whether a company was \u201covervalued\u201d by the book \u2014 and got steamrolled by inertia and sentiment.\n\nEspecially by a Tesla.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "Tesla Walked So These 3 EV Stocks Could Fly",
        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) market has been one of the most dynamic new markets in a while. American EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not only a major player in the EV space but helped to pioneer it as well. The Model S, which Tesla released way back in 2012, paved the way for the key aesthetics of a modern electric vehicle. Moreover, in the United States, for example, Tesla built up the charging infrastructure needed for EVs traveling long distances.\n\nSince then, a number of capable EV companies have entered the space, and several of them have done well for themselves. Furthermore, elevated interest rates coupled with ongoing inflationary pressures have created a prolonged EV slump, a downturn that has sorely affected Tesla and its sales figures. Moreover, as China supercharges its EV market, more competitors have emerged, putting Tesla, again, on the defensive.\n\nBelow are three EV stocks that probably wouldn\u2019t be here if it were not for Tesla, yet currently have better prospects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD (BYDDY) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nThe Chinese EV champion BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) continues to make waves in both domestic and international markets. BYD has developed quite an efficient, vertically integrated business that not only manufactures the cars themselves but also develops the batteries that go into them and enables a supply chain of various EV material inputs. There was a lot of reporting at the beginning of 2024 that the Chinese EV market might not hold up, and sequential growth from December had slowed. However, Chinese EVs ended the first quarter better than anyone expected. BYD, in particular, reported sales increasing 46% year-on-year (YOY) to 301,631 passenger vehicles. A total of 300,114 of them included hybrid and pure battery EVs.\n\nSecond-quarter EV sales jumped 21% YOY to 426,039 vehicles, while Tesla\u2019s second-quarter deliveries fell 4.8% to 443,956 vehicles. This puts BYD back on track to the be the world\u2019s largest EV producer again in 2024.\n\nDespite all the success, BYD also trades at a cheaper valuation multiple to Tesla: 21x forward earnings.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is another stock that appears to be on its way to eclipsing Tesla, at least in Li Auto\u2019s home market, China. The EV maker specializes in designing and manufacturing premium SUVs.\n\nAccording to its website, \u201c[Li Auto] started volume production in November 2019. Its current model lineup includes Li MEGA, a high-tech flagship family MPV, Li L9, a six-seat flagship family SUV, Li L8, a six-seat premium family SUV, Li L7, a five-seat flagship family SUV and Li L6, a five-seat premium family SUV.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to intense price wars and production ramp-up, Li Auto experienced double-digit growth in the first quarter. Li Auto delivered 80,400 vehicles in the first quarter, which was above the upper end of its guidance range. That represented a YOY increase of 52.9%. Li Auto reported 47,774 vehicle deliveries for the month of June, representing an uptick of 46.7% YOY. For the full second quarter, Li Auto delivered 108,581 vehicles, which represented an increase of 25.5% YOY.\n\nLi Auto remains Tesla\u2019s closest rival in the China market, and the Chinese EV maker even surpassed Tesla in sales at a point late last year.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a luxury EV company that got its start in 2009. Back then, Rivian, founded by MIT graduate Robert \u201cRJ\u201d Scaringe, focused on sports cars. Not until 2015, after Tesla\u2019s rise to fame, would the company shift its strategic focus to electric trucks and SUVs that catered to outdoor enthusiasts and adventure seekers. In that time, Rivian also acquiredMitsubishi\u2019s (OTCMKTS:MSBHF) automotive plant in Normal, Illinois in 2017 so that the EV maker could boost production.\n\nFast forward to today, Rivian has also struggled with the ongoing EV slump, but because the company has focused so much on the luxury segment of the market, the impact of the slump overall has been mixed. Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles in Q2, 9.1% more from the 12,640 vehicles the EV maker delivered in the second quarter of 2023. The EV maker had to pause production in its Normal, Illinois plant, which explains the slowdown, but management expects things to pick up and to reach its 57,000-vehicle production target for the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Cars are here to stay. They are arguably the most important form of transportation for billions of people and have been so for decades. Almost certainly they will hold that position for decades to come. However, this vitality is not expressed as much as it should be in the stock market. Some car companies have valuations the same as their yearly revenue, showing that investors do not have high expectations for the future.\n\nBelow are three auto stocks that are heavily undervalued that investors should get their hands on.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese EV company dominating the market but is unfairly undervalued. A key competitive edge they possess is the range of their EVs. Using their range extenders, they make their EVs more accessible and easier to use, because they are more convenient and can be used by customers far away from chargers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company is using its earnings to start new initiatives. Li recently announced plans to invest more than 6 billion yuan to build 5,000 charging stations, opening new lines of revenue. At the same Li Auto constantly creates new and improved EV models, most recently launching the Li L6.\n\nLooking at Li Auto\u2019s financials, they also back up the buy thesis. The company should be valued higher than $22 billion, which is low considering its tremendous growth. Last year Li\u2019s revenue grew to $17.4 billion, an impressive 173%. In the most recent quarter, revenue growth was only 36%, but still very impressive. At the same time, Li Auto is profitable and has been for a long time. This makes the company worth more as it makes it easier to keep growing without investor money and debt, while also providing it with a shield against bankruptcy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is an American giant that is trading at a market cap near its yearly revenue, showing high potential for an increase in valuation. A key reason for this valuation is because of a consensus among investors that gas-fueled cars will not be popular in the future. GM solved this by heavily investing in its EV segment.\n\nIn 2023 alone, the company delivered over 75,000 EVs and expects to produce between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs just in 2024. Additionally, General Motors is investing $35 billion in EV cars through 2024. That will help it reach economies of scale and beat most smaller companies that could not fathom spending that much on development.\n\nGM is a buy based on its financials.\u00a0 In just 2023, the company sold a staggering 6.2 million cars worldwide, a number is 4% larger than the year-ago figure and equivalent to 7.1% of all vehicles sold globally. It also equates to nearly $140 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile costs are high in the auto industry, GM has strong margins that are generally around 7%, which gives the company massive profits to invest in R&D and setting up the company to thrive in the future by investing in EVs. They also have over $25 billion in cash, which protects them from negative economic downturns and allows them to keep growing.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDY) sells more EVs than any other manufacturer in the world. It recently took the title from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and owns roughly 18% of the global EV market. Despite this dominance, the company is valued at just a fraction of Tesla. BYD trades for approximately $100 billion compared to Tesla at $791 billion.\n\nThe company has many advantages to its competitors, too. Among them are its vertical integration, the fact it makes its own computer chips and also has lithium mines for battery production. BYD also continuously introduces successful models. It just developed a competitive hybrid car that can drive over 2,000 kilometers without stopping. It is also expanding its marketing. BYD became one of the main sponsors of the UEFA Euros, one of the most-watched sporting events internationally.\n\nBYD\u2019s financials make the company a strong buy. They are making a profit with a strong margin of around 4% versus most other EV manufacturers that lose money. However, where the EV maker experienced periods of tremendous sales growth last year of as much as 68%, sales are dramatically slowing.\n\nIn the first quarter, BYD sales rose just 2.3% year-over-year. The rest of the EV industry also got caught by the slowdown. Investors need to go in eyes wide open. Despite that, the company remains the dominant EV carmaker and is only becoming more so. It shows the market is severely undervaluing BYD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla downgraded to Sell at UBS; valuation premium 'too significant,' analyst says",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock is trading higher on Friday despite a prominent analyst slapping a Sell rating on the stock - with valuation the chief culprit.\n\nTesla, which slid 8% yesterday following reports the EV-maker was going to delay its upcoming August 8 robotaxi reveal, is still nearly flat for the year despite a steep early year selloff. It\u2019s the sharp climb back higher for Tesla stock\u2014nearly 30% in the past month\u2014that has Joseph Spak at UBS worried.\n\n\u201cTSLA has always traded with a premium attached to it for other, future growth initiatives. However, at current levels, we believe that unidentifiable premium is too significant,\u201d Spak wrote in a note to clients. \u201cGiven the lack of visibility and the risk that these growth opportunities materialize on a longer time horizon (or don\u2019t materialize at all), we rate the stock Sell.\u201d\n\nSpak acknowledges that Tesla is more than just an auto company, a claim that CEO Elon Musk has touted for some time now. Musk contends that Tesla is an AI, robotics, and autonomous tech company first, and automaker second. Spak also credited Tesla for \u201cpositive developments\u201d in other areas such as its energy business and FSD, or full-self driving software. But, again, valuing those businesses and their long-term potential is difficult, he said.\n\nSpak's valuation breakdown found that at current levels, the market is valuing Tesla\u2019s core auto business at around $60-90 a share given its current sales trends, with the \u201cother\u201d business like energy, robotics, autonomous, etc. - making up the rest at around $175 a share.\n\nThe UBS analysis finds that those other businesses are worth around $93 in their view, meaning there is still a 60% premium attached to those those businesses, which is a bridge too far for UBS.\n\nHence the Sell rating on Tesla, and $197 price target, which the UBS team believes accurately values Tesla, its core auto business, and its other endeavors.\n\nSpak acknowledges the bank could be proven wrong. Tesla stock has traditionally traded more on momentum and not company fundamentals, Spak noted, and this trend could conceivably continue. Musk dreams: Illustration of fully autonomous driving (FSD) software in China in April. (Photo: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nA wildcard worth noting is Tesla\u2019s upcoming Robotaxi day. Though it may reportedly be delayed until October per Bloomberg, Spak believes market sentiment is more negative than positive heading into the event, and a \u201ctrue upside surprise\u201d could happen - meaning the product or its functionality could be more advanced than initially thought.\n\nAnd while the UBS team believes Tesla is making good progress with robotaxis, the challenges are still too great, and payoff too far off.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe believe robo-taxis are a difficult technological endeavor and the business model also may face regulatory hurdles as well as questions around consumer adoption. Thus, we believe a meaningful robo-taxi operation in the US is further out (not this decade).\u201d\n\nFinally Spak said a new, cheaper vehicle\u2014one that Tesla has promised will be unveiled soon\u2014would be more meaningful than the Tesla robotaxi, and could make the firm update its long-term Tesla sales model.\n\nSpak and UBS estimate the standard car or compact market at around 1 million cars a year in the US. And given Tesla\u2019s historical market share of around 40-50% for the midsize EV market with the Model 3 and Model Y, the opportunity for 450K annual compact EV sales is within the realm of possibility.\n\nTesla currently has 27 analysts rating its stock a 'buy' or equivalent, with 19 rating it a 'hold,' and 14 including UBS giving it a 'sell,' per Bloomberg.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "Dow Reaches Record Highs Above 40,000, Small Caps Ride The Rate-Cut Wave, EV Stocks Rally: What's Driving Markets Friday?\n\nIt\u2019s another memorable day for the stock market, as the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average Index reaches new record highs, surpassing the 40,000-mark milestone and breaking the previous peak set in May.\n\nSmall caps continue their rally driven by strong bets on interest rate cuts, sustaining momentum after Thursday\u2019s extraordinary surge. The Russell 2000 Index, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), has had its best week of the year, gaining over 6%.\n\nEach of the eleven S&P 500 sectors showed a gain Friday, with the index of the 500 largest U.S. corporations rising 0.9%. For the S&P 500, this marks the tenth positive week out of the last twelve.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 also showed a solid rebound, rising by 1% after a 2.2% selloff the previous day.\n\nOn the macro front, producer inflation rose more than expected in June. However, this did not affect expectations for rate cuts, with traders firmly anticipating a cut in September, assigning it a near-certain probability.\n\nThe consumer sentiment index measured by the University of Michigan continues to show signs of weakness in July, though it also indicates a decrease in future inflation expectations.\n\nMajor banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings, yet market reactions were negative, particularly for Wells Fargo amid a weakening outlook on net interest income.\n\nTreasury yields were steady, with the 10-year yield hovering at 4.20%, on track for the lowest close since late March. The dollar weakened further, poised for its second consecutive week of declines.\n\nIn commodities markets, gold inched up 0.1%, battling for its fourth straight session of gains. Natural gas spiked 3%, while oil prices softened by 0.2%.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rose by 1.3%, trading above $58,000.\n\nFriday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,150.28 1.2% Nasdaq 100 20,415.64 1.0% S&P 500 5,633.65 0.9% Dow Jones 40,101.75 0.9%\n\nUpdated at 1:00 PM ET\n\nAccording to\u00a0Benzinga Pro\u00a0data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.9% higher to $561.58.

Sector-wise, the\u00a0Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY)\u00a0outperformed, up by 1.7%, while the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) lagged, up 0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nEV-related stocks rallied substantially amid strong expectations for Q2 deliveries. Shares of Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rocketed 21%, 11% and 4% respectively. Bank of New York York Mellon Corp. (NYSE:BK) rose over 5%, in reaction to its earnings, eyeing the strongest session in two years. QuantumScape Corp. (NASDAQ:QS) rallied 18% after the company announced Thursday it entered into an agreement with Volkswagen\u2019s PowerCo to industrialize solid-state batteries Carvana Co.

        "title": "Tesla\u2019s AI dreams may \u2018materialize on a longer time horizon (or not at all),\u2019 UBS warns",
        "content": "UBS downgraded Tesla stock from a \u2018Neutral\u2019 to a \u2018Sell\u2019 rating on Friday, warning that expectations for the EV giant\u2019s core automotive business are deteriorating and its AI investments may not pay off.\n\n\u201cWhile TSLA is investing heavily in AI and the tech is making progress, investment is costly, pace of improvement may slow and the payoff is long dated,\u201d analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note to clients. \u201cGiven the lack of visibility and the risk that growth opportunities materialize on a longer time horizon (or not at all)...[we] downgrade to Sell.\u201d\n\nSpak also said he believes Tesla\u2019s valuation may have been driven too high, too fast by overly optimistic AI-loving investors. Despite lower expectations for growth in its EV businesses, Tesla is trading at over 85 times its forward earnings\u2014compared to around 36 times forward earnings for the wider tech sector.\n\nTesla has struggled with EV demand issues this year amid rising competition, particularly in China, leading its share prices to lag the wider market through the first four months of the year. However, AI opportunities in robotics and self-driving cars, as well as better-than-expected second quarter delivery figures helped spark a huge rally in Tesla stock this summer. Shares have surged roughly 70% from their April 19 low to over $249 Friday.\n\nBullish analysts have long pointed to the potential for trillions in revenue from Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi business as a reason to be optimistic about the company\u2019s future. ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood even argues Tesla shares will surge to $5,000 by 2030 as the company takes advantage of what will be, in her view, an $8 to $10 trillion self-driving car market in under six years.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm took a big hit this week, however, after Bloombergreported that Tesla is moving its highly anticipated \u201cRobotaxi Day\u201d\u2014where it promised to unveil robotaxi prototypes\u2014from August to October. Tesla stock sank more than 8% on Thursday, but recovered some of those losses Friday.\n\nStill, Tesla bulls certainly weren't abandoning Elon Musk and company on Friday. Wedbush tech Dan Ives argued that Tesla's recent stock price drop after the Robotaxi Day event date change was simply the result of a \u201cknee jerk reaction\u201d from investors who don\u2019t recognize that a slight delay won\u2019t change the long-term potential of Tesla\u2019s self-driving car fleet.\n\n\u201cWe await to hear from Musk but our bullish AI and robotics thesis on Tesla is unchanged if the timing moves from August to October although clearly this is not ideal,\u201d he wrote, maintaining his \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $300 price target.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It\u2019s hard to think about selling a stock after the incredible first-half rally that\u2019s beginning to carry into the second half. Undoubtedly, taking a bit of profit off the table while you\u2019re up may be a wise idea, especially if you\u2019re uneasy over slightly higher valuation multiples.\n\nThat said, with numerous firms seizing AI opportunities, profit-takers may also face considerable risk of missing out on upside. Indeed, the FOMO mentality can get many gain-seeking investors into deep trouble.\n\nHowever, as long as the fundamentals justify higher multiples, selling may not be the best course of action.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s look at three tech stocks that are not in that camp. Only time will tell how the following stocks fare, as they become markedly more expensive than that of historical averages. In any case, the following are a tad on the overvalued side, and perhaps long overdue for a serious pullback.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a wonderful semiconductor play that\u2019s seen its stock enjoy one of the steepest melt-ups out there. Now up more than 200% from its late-2022 lows, though, AVGO stock seems to be lacking in value.\n\nBroadcom stock\u2019s recent rally from its June correction is a testament to how resilient the semiconductor firm really is. Either way, Broadcom could find itself sinking quickly if the AI trade were to falter in the second half.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not to say there haven\u2019t been massively positive developments. The company recently announced it\u2019s working with TikTok maker ByteDance to build an AI chip. It\u2019s a big deal to team up with one of the most influential social-media powerhouses in the world.\n\nThough I\u2019d not take the news lightly, I do view the move as mostly baked in here with AVGO stock going for 73.7 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). The 1.23% dividend yield is a nice touch, but it\u2019s a fraction of what it used to be.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is having its moment in the sunshine following as investors let out a collective sigh of relief following the reveal of the latest deliveries. Indeed, the auto tides seem to be turning, all while Tesla continues innovating heavily on the front of AI and robotics.\n\nWhether we\u2019re talking about the Optimus robot (new design due later this year) or the potential for Tesla to win the robotaxi race, there\u2019s a lot of hype baked in right now.\n\nAs the EV firm looks to add to its winning streak \u2014 currently up 11 straight sessions \u2014 questions linger as to how the parabolic spike will end. Not to discount Tesla\u2019s AI capabilities, but with a newly-raised expectations bar, the chances of a colossal disappointment are raised.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of stiff EV competition out there and if a robotaxi scene suffers another big setback. Perhaps it\u2019s best to wait for a steeper pullback before scooping up the stock.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nIs generative AI a threat or an opportunity for a company like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)? A strong case could be made for either camp. That said, all it will take is a competitor with better AI chops to cause investors to view AI as more of a threat than an opportunity.\n\nIn any case, AI represents both a risk and an opportunity for Adobe. The company has to be miles ahead of peers on generative AI if it\u2019s to stave off competition, not just from the likes of smaller creative startups, but big tech.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the rest of the Magnificent Seven firms have used generative AI to create stickers and other images for personal use in recent quarters. Such AI features pose minimal risk to Adobe today. However, what happens if AI-created stickers represent just the tip of the iceberg?\n\nIndeed, a company like Apple could easily land a heavy blow on Adobe if it decided to double down on creative software with the power of AI. Given the higher stakes in the AI age, I\u2019m cautious on ADBE stock after its latest melt-up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

        "content": "Beaten-down stocks do rebound. And often, the reversal is dramatic. Just look at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In the first half of the year, the electric vehicle maker\u2019s stock was one of the worst performers in the benchmark S&P 500 index. But since the end of June, TSLA stock gained 44% and erased its previous loss on the year. And that big move higher occurred in just 10 trading sessions.\n\nSimilarly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) staged a remarkable rebound in recent weeks. In the year\u2019s first half, the company couldn\u2019t do anything right and its stock badly trailed the overall market. Even Warren Buffett, a notorious Apple bull, reduced his stake in the company by 10%. However, AAPL stock bottomed in mid-April and has since risen 40%. It is now trading at an all-time high on a split-adjusted basis.\n\nThe point is that most stocks go through drawdowns. It is important not to panic and to hold on through the pullbacks or, better yet, see them as a buying opportunity. Here are three beaten-down stocks ready for a jaw-dropping rebound.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll is not lost at sneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE). Investors who buy the stock now when it is down 33% on the year and trading at a 52-week low will likely be glad they did. NKE stock is unlikely to fall much further and is poised for a recovery as management undertakes a turnaround strategy at the athletic apparel company. Trading at 19 times future earnings, NKE stock hasn\u2019t been this affordable in at least a decade.\n\nThe key problems at Nike have been sluggish sales in China and a failed strategy that had seen the company try to drive sales through its website and branded stores rather than through wholesalers and third-party retailers such as Foot Locker (NYSE:FL). However, Nike is working to shift course and make progress. Revenue from its wholesale channels rose 5% in the most recent quarter.\n\nNike is also in the process of cutting costs by $2 billion over the next three years. Plus, Nike continues to have a strong brand and a commanding global market share of nearly 40%. In time, NKE stock will rebound.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) Statue of Disney's (DIS) Mickey Mouse in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems to be a case of one step forward, two steps back for shares of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS). Disney\u2019s stock began the year with a nice rally. Unfortunately, it stalled at the end of the first quarter. Since then, DIS stock declined 22%.\n\nWorse, the stock has become a long-term laggard. Over the past five years, the company\u2019s share price declined 33%. No wonder activist investors are targeting Disney\u2019s management team.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news is that Disney appears to be turning a corner, and a sustained rebound in its share price could come soon. The company reigned in spending on content for its Disney+ streaming platform, announced that it is spending $60 billion on its parks division over the next 10 years, and is partnering with other entertainment companies to bundle their streaming services and combine content.\n\nIt might take time, but when DIS stock finally rebounds, it will likely be jaw-dropping.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is another iconic brand whose stock has been beaten down to a 52-week low. Currently, SBUX stock is down 22% this year and is trading 19% lower than it was five years ago.\n\nBuying the dip while the share price is at its lowest point in a year might be wise, particularly for investors with a long time horizon.\n\nAdmittedly, Starbucks\u2019 first-quarter financial results were a disaster. Worse, the company lowered its forward guidance, and management said that its coffee shops will likely continue underperforming for several more quarters.\n\nThat said, there is a glimmer of hope for SBUX stock. Late last year, the company unveiled details of a strategic plan that will see the retail coffee chain open 17,000 new locations by 2030 while cutting $3 billion in costs. The company has also begun labor negotiations with its unionized stores.\n\nThis all makes Starbucks a beaten-down stock to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Falls 8% on Robotaxi Event Delay: Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Tesla's TSLA visionary CEO, Elon Musk, is celebrated as one of the most influential entrepreneurs. Under his leadership, the electric vehicle (EV) company has grown from its 2010 IPO valuation of $1.7 billion to a staggering market capitalization of roughly $800 billion today. However, Musk's grand vision is often accompanied by delayed timelines and unfulfilled promises.\n\nThe recent postponement of Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated robotaxi event, initially slated for Aug 8 but now pushed to October, exemplifies this trend. On the first-quarter 2024 earnings call, Musk confirmed showcasing the company\u2019s purpose-built robotaxi or Cybercab in August. Investors had set high hopes for it. So, this delay has seemingly not gone down too well with investors. The stock plummeted 8% yesterday, snapping an 11-day rally that erased its losses for the year. Tesla shares have now returned to negative territory for 2024, down 3% year to date.\n\nSo, is this a buying opportunity or should investors brace for more correction? Before that, let's examine Tesla's history of unmet promises regarding robotaxis and self-driving technology and understand why autonomous vehicle (AV) developments are so critical for the company's future.\n\nTesla's Unfulfilled AV Promises\n\nMusk has repeatedly heralded the dawn of fully autonomous vehicles, promising groundbreaking advancements that have yet to materialize. In 2015, he projected that Tesla cars would achieve full autonomy within three years. The following year, he claimed that a Tesla car would complete a cross-country journey without human intervention by 2017. In 2019, Musk ambitiously forecasted one million robotaxi-ready vehicles by 2020. To date, Tesla has not delivered a single robotaxi or autonomous vehicle that meets these lofty expectations.\n\nTesla\u2019s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems, while impressive, still require driver supervision and accountability. This reality is in contrast to Musk\u2019s bold claims, with Tesla currently embroiled in several wrongful death lawsuits linked to its driver-assist technologies. Meanwhile, competitors like Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Waymo and General Motors\u2019 GM Cruise have made more substantial strides in the AV arena.\n\nTSLA\u2019s AV Strategic Imperative\n\nTesla\u2019s AV efforts are not just any project but a very critical component of Musk\u2019s vision for the company\u2019s future. On the first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk emphasized the importance of autonomy for Tesla, framing it as the next significant growth driver amid waning demand for EVs and rising competition. He urged investors to either believe in Tesla\u2019s autonomy strategy or reconsider their positions. Quoting him, \u201cIf somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s planned robotaxi event was anticipated to showcase the company\u2019s advancements and set the stage for its next growth phase. Analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush have touted Tesla as the most undervalued AI player in the market, with the potential to revolutionize the autonomous transportation sector. The delay of the robotaxi event has undoubtedly dampened investor enthusiasm, raising concerns about Tesla\u2019s ability to meet its ambitious goals and timelines.\n\nThis comes at a time when the company is grappling with declining sales and shrinking margins of EVs due to aggressive price cuts and increased competition, particularly in China.\n\nTesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. However, industry experts anticipate that developing self-driving systems and robotaxis will be challenging and time-consuming due to significant engineering and regulatory obstacles.\n\nSome analysts and investors still remain optimistic. They view the delay as a sign that Tesla is refining its prototypes to ensure a more impactful unveiling. Jamie Meyers, a senior analyst at Laffer Tengler Investments, echoes this sentiment, suggesting that the two-month delay is a minor hiccup in the grand scheme of Tesla\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\nShould You Buy TSLA Stock at Current Levels?\n\nTesla commands a premium valuation due to its innovation and growth prospects, but even then, its valuation is a bit too stretched, given current challenges. The company's ability to deliver on promises like a lower-priced model and advancements in self-driving technology will be critical. Currently, TSLA shares trade at 7.25 times forward earnings, significantly higher than the industry average of 1.52 as well as its 5-year median of 6.95. It carries a Value Score of C.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA\u2019s 2024 EPS has gone down by a cent in the past seven days to $2.47, implying a year-over-year decline of 20.8%.\n\nAdditionally, the Zacks average price target of $181/share suggests a nearly 30.7% downside for the stock from the current levels. More correction could be on the horizon.\n\nFor now, it might be prudent for investors to wait for more clarity and stability before taking any position in the stock. While potential investors should wait for a better entry point, existing shareholders should hold the stock for a long-term horizon.\n\nTesla carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) now. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOn the one hand, Tesla\u2019s focus on AI and autonomous driving holds transformative potential, making it a smart bet for those with a high-risk tolerance and long-term perspective. On the other hand, the company\u2019s history of missed deadlines and the substantial engineering and regulatory challenges associated with AV development warrant caution.\n\nInvestors should closely monitor Tesla\u2019s upcoming earnings report on Jul 23, where further details about the robotaxi project are likely to emerge. It remains to be seen if the company can meet the latest target for unveiling the robotaxi in October. Also, any updates on AI investment costs will provide valuable insights into the stock\u2019s near-term trajectory.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Tesla downgraded, Booking Holdings upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop Upgrades:\n\nBenchmark upgraded Booking Holdings (BKNG) to Buy from Hold with a $4,700 price target. While the firm acknowledges its \"timing may not be optimal given the rash of ongoing economic worries,\" as well as some signs of anecdotal trading down in key European markets and how crowded the name is, it adds that its prior rating was inconsistent with its long-term view. Citi upgraded Array Technologies (ARRY) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $14, down from $17. The shares are down over 40% this year, likely on fears of project push-outs, an unexpected CFO change, potential near-term margin pressure due to freight costs, and price declines, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Jefferies last night upgraded Inter Parfums(IPAR) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $140. The shares are oversold after dropping 17% year-to-date, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Jefferies upgraded Osisko Gold(OR) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged $19 price target. The firm cites the rise in gold prices providing a \"meaningful lift\" to forecasted free cash flows for gold-miners this quarter, with more to come in Q3.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nUBS downgraded Tesla(TSLA) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $197, up from $147. The stock's valuation premium has widened of late on artificial intelligence enthusiasm, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Piper Sandler downgraded Vita Coco(COCO) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $28, down from $29. The analyst continues to believe the Vita Coco brand has a long runway of growth, but says the stock looks fairly valued at current levels given the company's rising sea freight cost outlook. Baird downgraded UL Solutions(ULS) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $46, up from $41. The downgrade recognizes the stock's outperformance, and a bit higher risk around margin improvement, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Scotiabank downgraded Marathon Oil(MRO) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $29, down from $45. Given that ConocoPhillips' (COP) acquisition of Marathon will close by year-end, Marathon faces risk-arb pressures and the reduced price target is reflective of the stated exchange ratio, the analyst says.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nWolfe Research initiated coverage of Spotify(SPOT) with an Outperform rating and $390 price target. The firm said that, relative to the music labels, Spotify provides pure-play exposure to evergreen music streaming without hit-driven variability, artist negotiation risk, and boasts minimal capital investment intensity. BTIG initiated coverage of Carvana (CVNA) with a Buy rating and $155 price target. The company trades at a premium to most e-commerce and auto-related stocks, but its vertically-integrated and in-sourced business model is \"simply a better mousetrap in an enormous\" total addressable market that investors shouldn't overlook, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Barclays initiated coverage of Revolution Medicines(RVMD) with an Overweight rating and $52 price target. The analyst sees \"two value-inflecting data readouts\" in the second half of 2024 for the company. Stifel assumed coverage of Six Flags Entertainment(FUN) with a Buy rating and price target of $68, up from $53. The analyst is constructive on the new entity and believes there is \"ample upside\" to the legacy Six Flags parks. Scotiabank initiated coverage of Fluence Energy(FLNC) with a Sector Perform rating and $21 price target. The firm view Fluence - a pure play on large-scale battery storage providing utility-scale energy storage solutions for large utility projects - as a beneficiary of the secular growth trend in utility-scale battery storage in the U.S. as it ramps domestic manufacturing capacity and nearshores its supply chain.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Buy Toyota Stock Before it Reenters the Fast Lane",
        "content": "Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) has experienced roller coaster price action thus far in 2024. Toyota stock soared from January to March, but since the spring, shares have fallen by around 20% from their 52-week high.\n\nThe reasons for this reversal are manifold. The Japan-based automaker has recently reported big sales declines in Asia and Latin America. A testing falsification scandal in Japan has also had a negative impact on TM\u2019s price performance.\n\nYet while Toyota has for now exited the fast lane, all while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has reentered it, don\u2019t assume that these trends will continue indefinitely. Pretty soon, these latest headwinds for what is the world\u2019s largest automaker could enter the rearview mirror.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs Toyota makes further progress with its EV and hybrid vehicle plans, which differ from other automakers, shares could really be firing on all cylinders once again.\n\nToyota Stock: Making Sense of Recent Concerns\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why the aforementioned issues have had a moderate impact on the price performance of Toyota shares lately. Sales weakness in Asia, particularly in China, suggest that Toyota\u2019s more cautious vehicle electrification strategy was a severe misstep.\n\nWhile not certain, declining sales in Latin America may be yet another sign that Chinese automakers are becoming a competitive threat to Toyota in not just Asia, but other regions of the world as well.\n\nChinese automakers have been increasingly targeting the Latin American auto market. The testing scandal may bode badly for Toyota in its home market, due to the resulting hit to its reputation.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible that the markets are overestimating how much these perceived problems really affect the Toyota stock bull case in the long run.\n\nWhile Asian and Latin American sales have kept declining, last month European sales were up 7.3% year-over-year. In the United States, Toyota reported 15.7% YOY sales growth during the month.\n\nWhen it comes to the testing scandal, the long-term impact may be minimal. At least, that\u2019s the view of analysts at Citi, who last month argued the overall impact from this scandal is \u201clikely to be modest.\u201d\n\nStill a Top Dark Horse EV Contender\n\nComparing the price performance of Tesla stock and Toyota stock since April, you may come to an erroneous conclusion about demand trends. You may think that, with TSLA shares rising, the EV maker has returned to growth. Conversely, with TM sputtering lower, you may be thinking that Toyota\u2019s hybrid-focused EV approach is proving to be a dud.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, much suggests that the latest Tesla rally has more to do with excitement over next month\u2019s Robotaxi unveiling. TSLA may have rallied after reporting better-than-expected delivery numbers for the prior quarter, but during Q2 2024, deliveries declined for the second quarter in a row.\n\nOn the other hand, Toyota has continued to grab a larger share of the U.S. electrified vehicle market. Last quarter, Toyota\u2019s hybrid, plug-in hybrid, EV and fuel-cell EV sales rose 63% year-over-year. What\u2019s the potential take-away from this?\n\nThese latest numbers provide more proof that the unbeaten path Toyota is taking to capitalize on the auto industry\u2019s \u201cgreen pivot\u201d still stands to prove successful. Instead of incumbent Toyota getting left in the dust by EV early-movers like Tesla, the early-movers may be at risk of losing ground to the latecomers.\n\nRunning on Empty for Now, but Not for Long\n\nIt may not just be stateside that Toyota beats expectations and proves the skeptics wrong. I wouldn\u2019t totally write off Toyota\u2019s prospects in other regions of the world. Masahiro Inoue, the new President of Toyota\u2019s Daihatsu subsidiary, has big plans to capitalize on high demand for small, affordable vehicles in emerging markets.\n\nThis strategy could help counter market share and sales declines in Asia. It may also help to regain ground lost in other regions of the world, where Chinese exports of EVs and gas-powered vehicles have flourished.\n\nTM stock is running on empty for now, but perhaps not for long. Shares trade for just 10.5 times forward earnings. TSLA has a forward multiple that\u2019s nearly 10 times that amount. While Tesla may be at risk of a severe price correction, it may take just a small amount of improved results to drive a massive rerating for Toyota stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Has there been any high-profile stock more volatile than Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) lately?\n\nFollowing a burst of investor optimism on the back of the company's latest delivery figures, the bears took over on Wednesday. A disquieting media report was responsible for the rapid mood change; this drove Tesla's share price down by more than 8% across the Hump Day trading session.\n\nA major product introduction apparently postponed\n\nBefore market open, Bloomberg published an article stating that Tesla will postpone the unveiling of its highly anticipated robotaxi. Citing unnamed \"people familiar with the decision,\" this is being done so the robotaxi team can rework certain elements of the vehicle and build more prototypes.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk had set the date of the robotaxi introduction for Thursday, Aug. 8. According to Bloomberg's sources, that will be pushed back by around two months.\n\nPreviously, investors were understandably excited about the robotaxi. Such a craft can open gushing new revenue streams for Tesla if managed effectively. Any delay is thus cause for concern.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) maker has not yet officially commented on the Bloomberg report.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings coming up soon\n\nWhile the robotaxi news certainly affected sentiment on Tesla stock, the major event to watch this month will be the company's second-quarter earnings. These are slated to be released on Tuesday, July 23 and will provide a clearer picture as to whether the company is showing true improvement in its operations and fundamentals -- or at least not showing significant erosion.\n\nOn average, analysts tracking Tesla stock are expecting a slight (2%) year-over-year decline in revenue to just over $24 billion. The bottom-line slump should be more dramatic, as those prognosticators are modeling a collective $0.61 per share for profitability. The year-ago figure was $0.91.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "'Warren Buffett Indicator' Sounds Alarm: Stock Market Levels Now Surpass Dot-Com Bubble, Great Financial Crisis\n\nFew investors have more market experience than Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) CEO Warren Buffett, who's seen his fair share of over-extended bull markets. After the Dot-Com Bubble crash in 2000, Buffett noted that comparing the market capitalization of stocks to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the best indicator of whether equities are overvalued or undervalued at current prices.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today? How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\n\nTrouble Brewing? The indicator, dubbed as the \u2018Warren Buffett Indicator' is calculated by looking at the ratio of the total market index compared to the GDP of the U.S. The total market index is tracked by the Wilshire 5000, which is a market-cap-weighted index tracking all U.S. publicly traded companies, comprised of more than 3,000 companies.\n\nJUST IN \ud83d\udea8: Warren Buffett Indicator hits 195%, the highest level in history, surpassing the Dot Com bubble, the Global Financial Crisis, and the 2022 Bear Market pic.twitter.com/SAE5MbHTlY\n\n\u2014 Barchart (@Barchart) July 9, 2024\n\nThe Numbers: Currently, the Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio sits around 195% according to Barchart, higher than the ratio preceding the dot-com bubble crash as well as the Great Financial Crisis in 2007-2008. In 2000, when internet stocks like Pets.com reached historically speculative levels, the Buffett indicator was around 140%. In 2007, ahead of the subprime mortgage crisis that wreaked havoc on the economy for years, the ratio was around 110%.\n\nTrending:This city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast \u2014 No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade.\n\nSo: In today's market, higher interest rates have done little to dampen the valuations of large tech companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) or NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), each trading with forward price-to-earnings rations above 50, well higher than the historical average for S&P 500 companies according to Macrotrends.\n\nBut, projections for earnings growth remains strong, indicating that while companies may look overvalued today, those multiples could come down to earth as earnings continue to grow. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, recently shared a chart on X showing that forward earnings expectations have steadily increased throughout the last few years, potentially helping explain why investors are willing to pay high premiums for stocks at current prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Why are stocks up so much this year?\" \ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\udd0e pic.twitter.com/BjfyPmimMs\n\n\u2014 Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) July 8, 2024\n\nWill the \u2018Buffett Indicator' predict another market crash due to high valuations compared to current GDP numbers? It will depend on if earnings continue to grow, thus driving GDP higher and bringing the Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio closer to its historical averages.\n\nRead Next:\n\nSun Belt's booming real estate market prepares for millions of new inhabitants \u2014 Here\u2019s how to find the region's best deals!

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Thursday as Wall Street was slapped with profit-taking even as inflation showed signs of cooling, with focus now turning to the second quarter earnings season.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,641.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat at 20,444.25 points by 19:03 ET (23:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,123.0 points.\n\nSoft CPI data ramps up Sept rate cut bets\n\nConsumer price index inflation read softer than expected for June, which saw investors ramp up bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates from September.\n\nHeadline CPI grew a slower-than-expected 3% year-on-year in June, while core CPI grew 3.3%, also less than expected.\n\nThe reading saw traders pricing in an over 85% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, a sharp jump from the 65% chance seen a day ago, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nBut the softer inflation, coupled with other middling readings on the U.S. economy in recent weeks sparked some concerns that growth was cooling.\n\nWall St sinks as tech faces profit-taking\n\nBut despite increased optimism over interest rate cuts, Wall Street indexes retreated from record highs on Thursday, hit chiefly by outsized losses in technology shares.\n\nThe losses came as investors collected a measure of recent profits in the sector, which had steadily risen in recent weeks on hype over artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 0.8% in aftermarket trade following a 5.6% slump on Thursday.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2% after tumbling 8.5% after a report said the firm\u2019s unveiling of autonomous taxis will be delayed to October from August.\n\nTech was the biggest weight on Wall Street on Thursday, after driving a stellar stock rally over the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% to finish at 5,584.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite slid 1.9% to 18,288.62 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% 39,753.75 points.\n\nQ2 earnings season begins with banks\n\nMarket focus was now squarely on the second-quarter earnings season, which is set to begin in earnest with a slew of key bank earnings on Friday.\n\nJPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo &Company (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) are set to report earnings through the day. Next week, majors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are set to report earnings on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFocus will largely be on whether corporate earnings were impacted by high interest rates and sticky inflation, which were seen causing some cooling in the U.S. economy in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady as Wall St falls after CPI data; Q2 earnings awaited\n\nBoeing nearing deal to sell 777X jets to Korean Air, sources say\n\nGlobal EV sales up 13% in June, down 7% in Europe, Rho Motion says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This summer is set to be a record breaker \u2013 with multiple heatwaves already impacting millions of people across the U.S. \u2013 even though we are still at the start of July. The weather has been so extreme that, tragically, people have passed away due to the heat this year.\n\nThe heat will naturally cause a spike in demand for energy-centric companies as more people use air conditioners in order to cool down, which is why today, I\u2019ll be talking about three energy companies you should invest in. The influx in demand comes at a crucial stage for all of these companies. If you want to crank up the magnitude of your returns, consider scooping up the shares of these three energy companies.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is primarily an EV company but has recently started to expand far beyond just vehicles. It is developing the \u201cTesla Bot,\u201d an AI-powered robot. Additionally, it has also rapidly expanded Tesla Energy. TSLA\u2019s energy division has seen rapid growth recently, making it an intriguing energy play for investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of quarterly revenue growth, TSLA has seen a reduction of -8.7% YoY, with a reduction of -55.1% in earnings YoY. The profit margin is sitting at 14.37%, with a lower operating margin of 5.50%. This reduction is drastic, but investors are bullish for multiple reasons, and this reduction is likely already priced in.\n\nTSLA has seen rapid growth in its valuation over the last few weeks; it is up over 50% over the last month, with investors being bullish on different concepts such as Robotaxi. However, it is important to note the impact of its energy segment, with Morgan Stanley increasing its price target for TSLA primarily based on the sector. This is for good reason; in Q2 2024, it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage, which is a record for the company, but pails in comparison to what is expected soon. This came as the company missed vehicle delivery targets, making it an important catalyst for investors to consider and weigh.\n\nExxon Mobile (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) is a premier crude oil and natural gas explorer and extractor. While it is based in the U.S., it operates all over the world, with many of its investments being international. Earnings are coming on July 26th, and as analysts are expecting lower earnings, the stock has slipped over the last month.\n\nIt\u2019s currently trading at a price of $113+ and is up almost 1% over the last month. The company has reported troubling earnings lately, by missing estimates in three of the last four quarters. Quarterly revenue is down 3.5% over the last year, with earnings down 28.1% over the same period. This is due to volatility in global energy prices, with has significantly impacted the margins XOM has.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there are reasons to be bullish, especially for the long run. Due to expectations sliding before earnings are released, a miss will already be priced in \u2013 to a certain extent. Additionally, a new director bought $2 million worth of XOM, which is a significant bullish move and carries a heavy impact. Additionally, investments in international locations for the purpose of oil/natural gas explorations indicate the company\u2019s commitment to increasing the stream of supply it has.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a leading clean energy company specializing in renewable power generation, operating wind, solar, and natural gas facilities, and providing electricity through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light.\n\nNEE stock is currently trading at ~$75, with a market cap of about $154 billion.

        "content": "Among the myriad workplace issues and worker strife at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Germany, one of the most contentious subjects for management may be that of missing mugs.\n\nIn a heated staff meeting otherwise filled with safety and pay concerns, Tesla plant manager Andre Thierig was troubled by the tens of thousands of coffee mugs that he said have gone missing from the factory, according to German state-owned broadcaster DW.\n\n\u201cWe've bought 65,000 coffee mugs since we started production here. 65.000! Statistically speaking, each of you already has five Ikea coffee cups at home,\u201d Thierig told Tesla factory workers, DW reported.\n\nThe plant manager said he was fed up and promised to take away cutlery from the break room if the thefts did not stop. Meanwhile, employees laughed and applauded the seemingly trivial issue during a tense meeting, DW reported.\n\n\"I'm really tired of approving orders to buy more coffee cups,\" Thierig said.\n\nThe coffee cup calamity comes as Tesla\u2019s German factory in Gr\u00fcnheide, southeast of Berlin, has faced many workplace and safety issues. The problems have gotten so bad that Jannes Bojert, the secretary of the IG Metall union that represents many of the Tesla workers, said a strike is not out of the question, although it is a \u201clast resort,\u201d DW reported.\n\nAfter several delays to its opening, the Gigafactory began operating in 2022 and has faced an abundance of headaches since then.\n\nThe plant has been plagued by safety issues, with German magazine Stern reporting last year that the Tesla factory had many more reported safety problems than average and three times more safety issues than a similar German Audi plant. Tesla later rejected claims made by the media and the IG Metall union that its safety provisions were inadequate, Reuters reported.\n\nAfter Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed plans to cut 10% of employees worldwide, the roughly 12,000 workers at the German Gigafactory are now concerned about their job security as well.\n\nThe Gigafactory has also been criticized by environmentalists for clear-cutting trees to create and expand the plant, as well as its effect on local water sources. Arsonists in March left the Tesla factory\u2014and 60,000 nearby residents\u2014without power after setting alight a high-voltage power mast near the plant.\n\nThe attack on the factory prompted a visit from Musk himself. It's doubtful that the case of the missing mugs will make the same waves.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What goes up must come down, and there are a lot of stocks that look vulnerable to a plunge right now. With the market at an all-time high, many stocks have seen their share price double or even triple in the last 12 months. Yet more than a few of these high-fliers look as if they\u2019re teetering on the precipice and could topple over on the slightest bad news.\n\nInvestors need to be careful as we enter the year\u2019s second half. Many analysts are warning of choppy waters ahead for the market. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) just warned of a stock market correction, forecasting a decline of 10% or more in the current third quarter. Should the predictions prove true with a market pullback, certain stocks look more vulnerable than others to a fall.\n\nSo, let\u2019s examine three such stocks poised for a dramatic plunge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) A Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs Bitcoin (BTC-USD) goes, so too goes cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Its earnings and stock rose in this year\u2019s Q1 as the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time high in March. But, it\u2019s likely to be a different story when Coinbase Global reports its Q2 results on August 1. While COIN stock is up 39% on the year, cracks are starting to emerge.\n\nIn the last month, COIN stock has declined 13%. The drop in the company\u2019s share price has come as the entire cryptocurrency sector has sunk. Ever since the Bitcoin halving event occurred in April, it reduced the available supply of the largest digital token by 50%. In one recent day of trading, the entire cryptocurrency market plunged in a 24-hour period, erasing $170 billion in market value.\n\nTherefore, the current environment does not bode well for Coinbase Global, which relies on cryptocurrency trading and deposits. The upcoming Q2 print could be an ugly one.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe current rally that has sent Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock up 45% since the end of June has been impressive. But it\u2019s not likely to last.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) maker is due to issue its Q2 print on July 23. And, it is likely to disappoint. Recent data concerning the company shows some worrisome trends. First, Tesla\u2019s Q2 deliveries were 5% lower than a year earlier. The stock has largely rallied because the latest delivery figures weren\u2019t worse than expected.\n\nSecond, it has just been reported that, for the first time, Tesla\u2019s share of the U.S. EV market has fallen below 50%. Data from Cox Automotive, a leading auto industry researcher, shows that Tesla now accounts for 49.7% of EV sales in the U.S., down from 59.3% a year ago. While Tesla is still the largest EV seller in the U.S., the company is losing ground to competitors such as Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F).\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the Q2 results show a continued erosion of Tesla\u2019s finances and market position, then the stock is likely to fall back into the red.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) have enjoyed a blistering run over the last year. But that run might be coming to an end. CVNA stock has gained 275% in the past 12 months, including a 163% year-to-date (YTD) gain.\n\nThe stock really took off after the used car retailer reported record financial results and turned a profit during this year\u2019s first quarter. The company announced EPS of 23 cents when Wall Street had been expecting a loss of 74 cents.\n\nThe strong print was attributed to efficiency gains in its operations and the reconditioning of second-hand vehicles. While the Q1 print and the stock\u2019s run over the last year have been exceptional, it\u2019s unlikely to last. This is because the shortage of new vehicles that occurred post-pandemic is now largely complete, and sales of used vehicles are declining while inventories grow on dealer lots.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to remember that Carvana has been here before. Despite the huge rally over the last year, CVNA stock is currently trading 64% below its all-time high reached in 2021. The decline occurred after bankruptcy concerns emerged at the company in 2022, decimating the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares are climbing at a frenetic pace, but it\u2019s becoming harder to argue the case for the bulls.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Archegos\u2019 Bill Hwang Convicted of Fraud, Market Manipulation Biden Aides to Meet Senators After Pelosi Remarks Deal Blow NATO Singles Out China Over Its Support for Russia in Ukraine Modi\u2019s Embrace of Putin Irks Biden Team Pushing Support for Kyiv\n\nThe last time there was a run like this, the rally was supported by revenues expanding at a double-digit clip. Things seem a lot gloomier now: The mood around electric cars is subdued, Tesla\u2019s sales are shrinking and its profits sagging.\n\nTesla has soared 44% over an 11-day winning streak that\u2019s the longest since June 2023. The stock now trades at 90 times forward earnings, a level that was last seen in early 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors say the surge is down to traders looking past Tesla\u2019s EV credentials and betting that Elon Musk can transform it into an artificial intelligence powerhouse. The idea is that when Musk finally unveils Tesla\u2019s keenly anticipated self-driving technology \u2014 the so-called robotaxi \u2014 on Aug. 8, it will solidify the company\u2019s position as a leading AI player.\n\n\u201cInvestors have been looking for that one breakthrough, real-world application of AI,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. \u201cAnd now we have someone who has been working on AI for years saying \u2018hey, I have got that killer application.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet, some numbers fly in the face of the current buzz around the stock: earnings are set to drop by 21% in 2024 and revenue growth is seen decelerating to just 2.2%.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a faith-based stock now, not one whose valuations are in any way tied to current earnings power, and every day the stock rallies the bar for the event just gets higher,\u201d Colas added.\n\nThe frenetic rally, which prompted bond billionaire Bill Gross this week to compare Tesla to meme stocks, picked up steam after the company\u2019s July 2 sales update suggested the worst of the EV slowdown may be over. But the surge has since taken on a wilder momentum.\n\nTesla is now the fifth-most expensively priced stock in the S&P 500 Index on a price-to-earnings basis, far surpassing the rest of the megacap technology cohort.\n\nOne risk is that the crowning success for Tesla in AI relies on it solving one of the most complex problems the technology has yet tackled \u2014 creating cars that drive themselves more safely than humans can. By and large, analysts and experts believe a real-world mass adoption of such technology is likely decades away.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla has \u201calways traded on hopes and dreams,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cIf you\u2019re not thinking about the future, the fact that this company is worth almost as much as the rest of the auto industry combined doesn\u2019t make sense. But if you think Elon Musk and Tesla are going to change the world, so what if you\u2019re paying 100 times earnings?\u201d\n\nEven with the dizzyingly high PE ratio, the share price of about $263 is a long way from the peak of about $410 touched in November 2021. That\u2019s because while Tesla\u2019s stock is staging a spectacular turnaround, its earnings are getting smaller. In 2021, when the stock rose 50%, annual profit jumped nearly seven-fold.\n\nNone of this makes it any easier to predict whether the rally is about to break. However, trading in the options market suggest investors remain optimistic.\n\n\u201cTesla options market positioning over the next three months has become extremely bullish,\u201d said Vishal Vivek, an equity trading strategist at Citigroup. Options imply traders are positioning for a more than 9% move in either direction when the company reports second-quarter results on July 23, the strategist added.\n\nTraders are bidding up the price of Tesla calls relative to puts, which shows added desire to chase the rally further, coupled with more muted demand for hedges in case the stock slumps.\n\nStill, not everyone is feeling brave enough to pile on.\n\nFor David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which holds the company\u2019s shares, the uncertainty around what Musk may present on Aug. 8 makes the risk \u201ctoo high right now to be investing new money into Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe eye-watering wave of buying is also a cause of some unease for other market participants, concerned that the tide may turn.\n\n\u201cThe biggest risk to Tesla shares is this level of volatility,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading. \u201cUsually, when you have this type of volatility, it works in both directions, so that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApple Inc. has avoided the threat of fines from European Union regulators by agreeing to open up its mobile wallet technology to other providers free of charge for a decade. Rivian is banking on the anti-Tesla crowd for VW partnership. The startup persuaded Elon-phobic car buyers to drop $70,000 on its EVs. Now it just needs to make money. Investors are growing increasingly concerned that US technology megacaps are spending too much on artificial intelligence, according Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists. India\u2019s Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. reported profit that topped analysts\u2019 estimates, signaling corporations are resuming spending on projects to take advantage of technologies such as artificial intelligence. Helsing, a startup developing artificial intelligence software for defense, has raised \u20ac450 million ($487 million) in venture capital funding that it plans to use to expand its presence in European nations bordering Russia.\n\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna, Michael Msika and Thyagu Adinarayan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom At SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs How Digital Money Really Works How Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What do you consider your buy-and-hold stocks? Some investors focus on growth, others lean towards value, and some even bet heavily on trending meme stocks \u2014 but which strategy is optimal?\n\nAs with everything in investing, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all rule for selecting your buy-and-hold stocks. However, for most retail investors with a long-term horizon, certain characteristics should form the backbone of your search. You\u2019ll notice recurring themes if you research these companies deeply enough. Broadly speaking, these potential buy-and-hold stocks combine a proven operational track record with substantial growth, robust financial health, and clear upside potential, making long-term capital appreciation a clear likelihood.\n\nAt the same time, some of these remain speculative plays compared to pure-value investments; this increases the chance of rapid growth and gains while their inherent risk is buffered by the stability of other buy-and-hold stocks, ultimately creating a well-rounded portfolio for the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSay what you will about Elon Musk, but there\u2019s no denying that investors who counted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) among their portfolio\u2019s buy-and-hold stocks had a stellar performance over the years. Just ask the legions of short sellers who bet otherwise and lost billions. Tesla\u2019s next bull run may just be getting started following Musk\u2019s pay package approval, which cements his focus on the firm and is already bearing fruit.\n\nThis shift is already evident just weeks after the decision, with Musk redirecting his AI focus back to Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory is constructing a massive GPU warehouse to house over 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, aiming to centralize AI development under Tesla. This follows Tesla\u2019s announcement of a $3 billion to $4 billion investment in AI hardware, signaling Musk and Tesla\u2019s commitment to becoming leaders in AI. Enhanced AI capabilities will significantly contribute to advancing Tesla\u2019s \u201cMarch of 9s,\u201d addressing the final major obstacle to achieving full self-driving car technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s robotaxi event on August 8 may prove the final catalyst catapulting Tesla from the (comparatively) lower price range it\u2019s traded at for the past year \u2014 meaning investors looking to buy and hold stocks like Tesla should act soon.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) may not have the flashiest operational model, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its buy-and-hold stock status \u2014 just the opposite, in fact. Visa\u2019s reliable sales streams, operational model, and willingness to adapt to new trends and markets are just some of the reasons Visa stock returned more than 400% over the past decade, doubling the S&P 500\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa owns about 20% of the global cashless payment processing market today, but that doesn\u2019t mean management is content with its current dominance. The opposite is true as Visa is making massive inroads toward new client lists while adopting new technology.\n\nSpecifically, Visa is bringing digital wallets (already popular among consumers) to enterprise and corporate clients to help streamline their spending. Corporate credit is already the largest chunk of global credit utilization, and digital wallet opportunities promise to increase its size further and reward VIsa\u2019s efforts.\n\nMarkel Group (MKL) Markel website homepage MRK stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarkel Group (NYSE:MKL), primarily known as an insurance company, might initially seem like an unconventional pick among buy-and-hold stocks given the sector\u2019s typically tight margins, despite benefiting short-term benefits from bond yields due to their substantial cash reserves. However, there is much more to Markel Group than meets the eye.\n\nOften dubbed the \u201cbaby Berkshire Hathaway\u201d (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), Markel Group, under the leadership of CEO Thomas Gayner, is somewhat modeled after Warren Buffett\u2019s approach at Berkshire. Gayner runs Markel as an insurance company and a large holding company that uses \u201cunderwriting profits to invest in equity, through both publicly traded stocks and ownership stakes in private companies.\u201d\n\nThis strategy paid off handsomely, with Markel achieving a 360% return over the past 20 years, edging out the S&P 500\u2019s 326% gain during the same period.\n\nDespite its seemingly high share price, much of the bearish sentiment around Markel focuses on its core insurance underwriting business, overlooking Gayner\u2019s innovative and successful investment approach. If you consider Gayner\u2019s historical performance and believe in his strategy\u2019s sustainability, Markel could be the biggest opportunity in decades if it goes the way of Berkshire.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ).

After a few rough quarters, compounded by wider market unease and a crippling short report that ultimately proved overblown, Block\u2019s most recent earnings report points to renewed strength.\n\nSpecifically, Block\u2019s gross profit improved by more than 20% to hit $2.09 billion, with much of that coming from its Cash App segment, which saw profit climb 25% year-over-year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 20% or better profitability growth, while sales also jumped 20%.\n\nMoreover, like Visa, Block is focusing on the future of finance \u2014 with a big emphasis on its crypto exchange and new blockchain ventures. Earlier this year, Block released its physical hardware crypto wallet, BitKey, to help diversify its customer base beyond those comfortable enough to hold coins in Cash App. Perhaps noting increased consumer concerns following the FTX debacle, Block is rapidly positioning itself as an all-weather crypto player to differentiate itself in the long term.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock finally broke free from its sub-$25 trading range, and many investors are noticing. But, for those paying attention, Palantir always counted itself among the ranks of quality buy-and-hold stocks, even if per-share pricing volatility made short-term trading tough.\n\nPalantir\u2019s biggest strength today is rapid diversification beyond government contracting; government contracts offer decent money and long-term sales, and staking your operational future on just a few clients \u2014 even governmental \u2014 is risky. But Palantir is seeing success compound across its corporate client list, creating a snowball effect as it delivers value to private firms as diverse as Tampa General Hospital, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), AARP, and even Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN).\n\nPalantir\u2019s operational model creates a certain amount of entrenchment and high switching costs; in other words, once a company relies on what Palantir offers, they\u2019re unlikely to move to a competitor. A wider range of corporate clients both diversifies and extends Palantir\u2019s sales streams, compounding Palantir\u2019s status among buy-and-hold stocks.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nFew stocks capture as wide a swath of the sustainable and green energy sectors as Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), making it a top buy and hold stock for sustainability-minded investors.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners holds a diverse portfolio of smaller renewable energy companies worldwide, focusing on long-term value rather than short-term gains. That trait makes it stand out among even the most forward-thinking buy-and-hold stocks. Brookfield\u2019s portfolio includes hydroelectric power, wind, utility-scale solar, and energy distribution solutions. This diversity helps investors to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies in specific sectors while aligning with the broader sustainability movement.\n\nManagement aims for a 12% to 15% total return by enhancing existing assets and securing market deals, creating a long-term compounding effect for buy-and-hold investors. Since Brookfield Renewable\u2019s parent company often deals with distressed debt investments, the current economic climate means plenty of new opportunities for management to set itself up for long-term momentum.\n\nSmaller firms struggling to raise capital or manage debt may find themselves attractive merger and acquisition targets for Brookfield, a trend we\u2019re already seeing accelerate.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prime choice for long-term buy-and-hold stocks, combining smart financial management, significant long-term growth potential, and innovative leadership that continues to push boundaries despite its size \u2014 a distinction not as evident in companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategic positioning in the AI sector may be the next catalyst to propel shares higher. While skepticism about more ambitious AI claims is understandable, the technology undeniably challenges traditional search engines and introduces new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft\u2019s existing software suite. Microsoft\u2019s hefty investment in OpenAI, the leading AI firm, secures it a front-row seat and early entrant advantage in developing the next major technological breakthrough.\n\nToday is reminiscent of the early 2000s when search engine technology was on the horizon, but consumers didn\u2019t realize its enormous potential and profitability. Among public companies, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this future potential, making it a top buy-and-hold stock for a forward-thinking investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in MKL.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "It is becoming clear that 2024 is a very different year than the last year. Although we\u2019re still in the middle of a bull market, it is more of a broad-based rally, higher this time than it was in 2023.\n\nBack then, the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for virtually all of the market\u2019s gains. This year, although most of those companies are still performing well \u2014 and some like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue to do very well \u2014 the seven tech giants are not having the same impact.\n\nWell, on the S&P 500 they are, because it is a market capitalization-weighted index. Six of the Magnificent Seven are worth $1 trillion or more (only laggard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not). That means their movements affect the index more than they do a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is also why the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date and the Dow is up a measly 4%. Yet this offers investors an opportunity. It suggests undervalued Dow stocks may be more prevalent than those on the popular benchmark index.\n\nSo let\u2019s dive into the three companies below that may be some of the best undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment bank in transition. Weighed down by acquisitions in wealth management and installment lending that it thought would diversify its operations, today the financial giant is reorganizing its efforts to concentrate on investment banking, trading, and investment management. It will continue divesting consumer-facing businesses.\n\nGoldman took big writedowns on its home improvement lender GreenSky, which it sold last October. It also scrapped its co-branded credit cards with General Motors (NYSE:GM) while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) terminated its Goldman Sachs card.\n\nThe turnaround effort is working. First-quarter profit exceeded analyst expectations as the investment banking division benefited from increases in underwriting and dealmaking. Last year was a mixed one for mergers and acquisitions. While dealmaking hit a decade low, some of the biggest acquisitions ever took place, including Exxon Mobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources. Goldman Sachs was the lead advisor on the $60 billion transaction.\n\nThe investment banker\u2019s stock is up 50% over the past year and Wall Street expects earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years. Trading at just a fraction to those projected growth rates, Goldman Sachs stock is one of the leading undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) has destroyed value for investors for years. Over the past decade, the owner of Post-It Notes and Scotch-brand tape has a total return of just 23% compared to a 190% return by the Dow.\n\nIts malaise culminated in May of this year when this former Dividend King slashed its dividend by more than half. Facing mounting lawsuits over faulty products (made by a company it acquired) and environmental pollution allegations, 3M was forced to conserve cash. But it also spun off its consumer products business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) to return some value to shareholders and began settling the lawsuits against it.\n\nToday, 3M is a much healthier company financially and the markets approve. Shares are up 9% in 2024 which turned the conglomerate into an undervalued Dow stock worth buying. 3M goes for 12 times earnings estimates and a deeply discounted 11x free cash flow (FCF). With a lower dividend payment, 3M can now support the payout. MMM stock deserves renewed consideration by investors.\n\nDow (DOW) DOW Chemical sign outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is fun to write: chemical stock Dow (NYSE:DOW) is an undervalued Dow stock. Shares trade at 12 times earnings estimates, a fraction of sales and 14x FCF. Dow stock, though, is down 5% this year and off 2% for the last 12 months. Shares remain 27% below the all-time high they hit in 2021.\n\nThe tide is turning for the chemicals company. Demand recovered in the first quarter even though sales were down 9% year-over-year. However, they were up 1% sequentially. Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling told investors, \u201cWe captured improving demand, maintained pricing, and benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs.\u201d As a result, volumes grew and margins expanded.\n\nBecause chemicals are a commodity and their price tends to move in tandem with Brent crude oil prices, Dow should benefit from Brent prices north of $84 a barrel. That is 5% above the price one year ago. The Energy Information Administration forecasts oil to trade around $89 a barrel in the back half of 2024. It does not expect that to change much next year as it forecasts Brent crude at $88 a barrel.\n\nThe higher prices should help Dow improve its capacity utilization. And with lower natural gas prices in the mix now and going forward, the chemicals stock should also benefit as it lowers its feedstock costs. That points to improving profitability and should have investors putting DOW stock on their buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and XOM stock.

        "title": "Tesla's US EV market share dips below 50% in Q2 as Ford, Kia, BMW see growth",
        "content": "As EV sales continue to grow in the US, albeit at a slower pace than expected, Tesla\u2019s share of the market dipped below a key level as improved competitor EV offerings hit showroom floors.\n\nCox Automotive's latest EV sales report found that Tesla\u2019s share of US EV sales fell below 50% for the first time, to 49.7%. This comes as Cox estimates overall EV sales grew to approximately 8% of the total market, up from the 7.2% seen in Q2 last year, in what it calls a \u201crecord-breaking\u201d quarter.\n\n\u201cDespite Tesla\u2019s declining sales, with its EV sales share now below 50% for the first time, the overall competitive landscape for electric vehicles is intensifying,\u201d Stephanie Valdez Streaty, industry insights director at Cox Automotive, said in the report.\n\nLooking over Cox\u2019s dataset starting in 2019, Tesla\u2019s market share hit a high of 82.5% in Q3 of 2019 and has been steadily declining ever since. The steepest drop has occurred in recent quarters, starting in Q4 2021, when Tesla\u2019s market share stood at 77.5%. It fell to 50.2% in less than two years (Q2 2023) as new brands and EVs from legacy automakers hit the market.\n\nTesla's slide in market shares coincides with a dip in Q2 deliveries. Tesla said it delivered 443,956 vehicles during the second quarter, higher than the 386,810 vehicles globally delivered in the first quarter but lower than the approximate 466,140 delivered a year ago.\n\nWith Tesla now sitting at 49.7% of the market, Cox found that Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Ford Lightning EV pickup, and E-Transit cargo vans have put it in second place with a 7.2% share. Kia, its sister brand Hyundai, and BMW rounded out the top five.\n\nDigging deeper into the fastest-growing brands in Q2, GM\u2019s Cadillac took top honors with EV sales growth of over 440%, powered by its LYRIQ midsize EV SUV. Though Cadillac\u2019s LYRIQ saw its initial rollout delayed as GM worked out kinks in its Ultium EV platform, sales momentum has been growing since the start of the year. Toyota has seen its lone EV \u2014 the bZ4X \u2014 grow sales to over 7,000 units in Q2 (from 2,000 a year ago), though reportedly with big discounts.\n\n\u201cThis increased competition is leading to continued price pressure, gradually boosting EV adoption, Cox\u2019s Valdez Streaty said. \u201cAutomakers that deliver the right product at the right price and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in EV adoption.\u201d\n\nGreater affordability could be spurring sales at Ford, Kia, and Hyundai. Kia's moderately priced EV6 crossover, EV9 large SUV, and Niro subcompact are reaching larger segments of the market, along with Hyundai's similarly priced Ioniq 5 crossover and Ioniq 6 sedan.\n\nStory continues\n\nLuxury brands like BMW and Cadillac are likely excelling in the customer service arena, Valdez Streaty noted, with higher-income buyers valuing dealer experience alongside product mix in their buying decisions. BMW EVs like the BMW iX SUV, i4 coupe, and i7 luxury full-size sedan have buoyed sales.\n\nConversely, BMW rival Mercedes, which leaned heavily into luxury, high-priced EVs, has seen EV sales fall in Q2 (down 22.3%), as its offerings at lofty prices have not hit home with consumers. Mercedes has now pivoted back to gas-powered vehicles and no longer sees itself going fully electric by 2030.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "Investing.com - In interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Steve Eisman, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, expressed his belief in the continued dominance of US megacap technology shares for years to come. He predicts this trend will be driven by the increasing accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) through consumer electronics.\n\nEisman, known for his successful \"Big Short\" bet against subprime mortgages before the global financial crisis, suggests that consumers' desire for new AI applications on smartphones and personal computers will trigger the \"biggest refresh cycle in history.\" This wave of upgraded device purchases will likely benefit tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, click here to save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nDespite Nvidia's high valuation, Eisman is not concerned. He points out that the company's earnings have tripled, making it a sound investment. Eisman has previously disclosed that he owns a substantial amount of Nvidia shares.\n\nEisman also shared his views on the broader economy, stating that although it's slowing down, the situation is stable. He sees no fundamental reason to short stocks significantly.\n\nReflecting on his past experiences, Eisman said, \"I predicted the end of the world once \u2014 it was pretty awful for everybody. I have no interest in predicting it again and there's no data to show that it's going to happen.\"\n\nRegarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Eisman believes there are times to short the company when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, he concedes that this becomes challenging when investors focus on Tesla's self-driving car and AI ambitions rather than its fundamentals. Eisman clarified that while he doesn't short for his clients, he occasionally does so on a personal basis.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSteve Eisman: Big tech dominance to continue, predicts Trump victory\n\nExclusive-Anson Funds pushing Five9 to explore a sale, sources say\n\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq tumbles despite soft CPI data, Nvidia falls 5.6%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) -Tesla is delaying the launch of robotaxi by about two months to October as the design team was told to rework some elements of the car, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the decision.\n\nShares of Tesla, which is betting on self-driving vehicles over less-expensive cars, fell more than 6% following the news, ending 11 straight sessions of gains that had pushed the stock up 44%.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nMusk had announced the unveiling of robotaxi on Aug. 8, after Reuters reported on April 5 that Tesla had canceled its long-promised inexpensive car and would continue developing self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Tesla has been playing this game for nearly a decade of promising 'next year, next year'. And I've seen no indication that Tesla...is on track for a meaningful deployment of the kind of automated driving system that Tesla has consistently promised,\" said University of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith, with expertise in autonomous vehicle law.\n\nExcept for announcing an unveiling date, Musk has given minimal details about robotaxi so far. He has only said that some vehicles will be owned and operated by Tesla, while others will be owned by individuals but rented out on Tesla's network.\n\nAnalysts and industry experts have said the race to develop autonomous driving systems and robotaxis will be arduous and take years as the technology faces engineering and regulatory hurdles.\n\n\"I think the (launch) event will be a disappointment as we were probably gonna get a CyberTaxi, not a RoboTaxi. Another hyperbolic exaggeration will likely be exposed. Nobody's going to be able to knit socks on their way to work or nap while the vehicle brings you to gramma's,\" Craig Irwin, senior research analyst at Roth MKM, said.\n\nMusk has been focusing on artificial intelligence, autonomous driving software, robotaxis and the humanoid robot named Optimus to combat a slowdown in EV sales, which generate more than 80% of Tesla's quarterly revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe said in the company's first-quarter earnings conference call in April that Tesla would introduce \"new models\" by early 2025 using its current platforms and production lines.\n\nDuring the call, he had outlined ambitious visions for diversifying Tesla's business into artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and operating a fleet of millions of autonomous vehicles - all based on software and hardware products the automaker has not yet fully developed.\n\nA source told Reuters that the billionaire visited Beijing in April on an unannounced visit to discuss the rollout of its full self-driving software and other data-transfer permissions.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia, Akash Sriram and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "content": "According to Bloomberg News on Thursday, electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will delay its planned robotaxi unveiling until October from August.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform X in April this year, Musk originally earmarked August 8 as the date Tesla would unveil its robotaxi. \"Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,\" he posted at the time.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company has now pushed back the date to allow its teams working on the project more time to build more vehicle prototypes,\n\nOptimism about the upcoming event has contributed to Tesla's strong share price rise over the last couple of weeks. However, Tesla stock price closed 8.4% lower following the news on Thursday, its biggest drop since March 4. It is now trading below the $245 mark. The news has also resulted in a boost to the share prices of Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER).\n\nIn a recent note to clients, analysts at Wedbush said \"the key for Tesla's stock looking ahead is the Street recognizing that Tesla is the most undervalued AI play in the market in our view with a historical Robotaxi Day ahead for Musk and Tesla on August 8th that will lay the yellow brick road to FSD and an autonomous future.\"\n\nThey added that Tesla's long-standing commitment to full self-driving, which was first mentioned in connection with robotaxis in 2019, is now becoming a reality.\n\nThe firm concluded: \"In a nutshell, the worst is in the rear-view mirror for Tesla as we believe the EV demand story is starting to return to the disruptive tech stalwart ahead of a historical Robotaxi Day on August 8th with the bears now heading back into hibernation mode and their caves.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla closes down 8.4% on report it will delay robotaxi unveiling\n\nExclusive-Anson Funds pushing Five9 to explore a sale, sources say\n\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq tumbles despite soft CPI data, Nvidia falls 5.6%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Flashing Danger Signs",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been the hottest sector in the stock market. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, it has been a race to develop the best and smartest generative AI platforms. Bloomberg Intelligence issued a report that potentially valued the generative AI industry at $1.3 trillion by 2032.\u00a0The AI hardware sector has exploded in value with every major tech company scrambling to buy high-powered GPUs. Semiconductor stocks have led the massive Nasdaq and S&P 500 rally over the past year. Over the past twelve months, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has gained more than 54%. Yet there could now be newly risky AI stocks.\n\nMany of these AI stocks have become overvalued and diverge from their fundamentals. At their current values, it\u2019s hard to justify chasing them after rallying for over a year. These three AI stocks flash danger signs and should be avoided at their current multiples.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYears ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the king of the chip industry. However, a drop in PC demand and being replaced as the chip provider for Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Macbook computers sent Intel into a downward spiral. While other chip stocks have flourished, shares of INTC are down by more than 30% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSome believed that Intel would be boosted after a deal with the US government. The agreement saw Intel receive $8.5 billion in funding to advance its AI chip technology. Despite this, Intel continues to lose ground in its core CPU business. Chip-rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) are eating away at Intel\u2019s market share after creating CPUs with superior performance and speed.\n\nAs a result, Intel is showing a negative revenue growth CAGR over the past five years. They are one of the only chip companies with negative growth in recent years. Comparatively, AMD has a five-year revenue CAGR of 30%, and ARM has a three-year CAGR of 17%. Intel is still trading at nearly 30x forward earnings, even with a five-year net income CAGR of -28%. The stock is too richly valued for its declining growth as it continues falling behind its peers and into a category of risky AI stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNo stock has been as front and center for the AI revolution as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). I outlined my views on Nvidia a couple of weeks ago, and thus far, my thesis for calling Nvidia\u2019s peak has been playing out. Shares of NVDA are up by nearly 200% over the past year of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia\u2019s recent 10-for-one stock split not only continued the stock\u2019s snowball but also made shares more accessible to retail investors. Those left out of the stock\u2019s historic one-year rally FOMO\u2019d into the stock at the top. Nvidia also faces the threat of homegrown GPUs from companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cheaper domestic offerings in China. Through its Made in 2025 policy, China plans to produce 70% of its chips domestically by the year 2025.\n\nThere is no denying that the company\u2019s recent growth has been impressive. Analysts have a current average price target of $119.32 and the stock even received a downgrade from a rating of Buy to Neutral by New Street Research. Nvidia will not continue to grow its revenue at a five-year CAGR of nearly 50%. With shares trading at 40x sales, any decline in revenue growth will result in the stock becoming increasingly overvalued. Nvidia is not the only way to gain exposure to AI.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot many people think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as an AI company, yet. What was once the most popular stock on the market has struggled in 2024, only recently bringing their year-to-date returns above water. After gaining nearly 30% in the first week of July, the stock has returned 1.2% in 2024 to shareholders.\n\nMuch of Tesla\u2019s long-term potential revolves around AI-based initiatives like their Robotaxi and Optimus robots. Tesla Bulls also believes in the future of their FSD technology as well as public listings of Elon Musk\u2019s other companies like SpaceX. But most, if not all, of these initiatives are a long way off from being a reality and some may never even come to fruition. Tesla vehicles are the best-selling EVs on the planet yet the market is pricing Tesla as more than just an automaker.\n\nEven if Tesla were a full AI company, the stock now trades at a sky-high valuation. At 101x forward earnings, Tesla trades at double Nvidia\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio. There is a future where Tesla is a leader in AI technology and software. Until we see any of these play out and hit the market, Tesla has to be considered an automaker more than an AI leader and thus one of the risky AI stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Dividend stocks have long been investor favorites. Not only do dividends provide a reliable stream of income but they also increase a portfolio\u2019s returns over time. They get even more exciting if they\u2019re undervalued dividend stocks.\n\nSince 1930, dividend stocks outperformed all other classes of stocks. The Hartford Funds found that over the last 95 years, stocks on the S&P 500 that initiated and raised their dividends have never had a losing decade. Through world wars and global pandemics, income-generating stocks were the best investments. No other stock can say the same.\n\nAnd it stands to reason. Dividend stocks to buy are successful businesses, and having gone through numerous business and economic cycles, have come through the trials intact. With capable management and a conservative outlook, they steered their companies well and shared their success \u2014 and profits \u2014 with shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three undervalued dividend stocks to buy in July. Despite the bull market and regardless of their performance, they now represent some of the best investments available.\n\nFord (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nEveryone focuses on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) when it comes to electric vehicles, but Ford (NYSE:F) is the sleeper play in the industry. Second-quarter U.S. sales inched up 0.8% and are 3.6% higher over the first half of 2024, but virtually all of the growth came from hybrid vehicles and EVs.\n\nHybrid sales surged 55.6% in the quarter, a record 53,822 vehicles, powered by the light-duty Maverick. The model accounts for almost 44% of total hybrid volume for the first six months of the year. Fully 59% of all Maverick buyers are considered \u201cconquest\u201d customers, or those who were considering buying other brands. They are trading in their compact cars and crossovers in favor of the truck\u2019s flexibility and adaptability.\n\nFord president and CEO Jim Farley told analysts earlier this year, \u201cIt\u2019s one of our fastest-growing vehicles.\u201d Sales are growing so fast Farley thinks Ford may run into a supply problem.\n\nYet F-150 hybrid pickups are also driving off the lots at a brisk pace with sales up 38% in the second quarter. The Escape was also rising 35% for the period.\n\nHaving been burned by its all-in bet on battery EVs, Ford quickly pivoted to hybrids and is reaping the benefits. Ford stock is up 7% in 2024 but trades at less than 7 times next year\u2019s earnings. With its dividend yielding an attractive 5.3% annually, the automaker is one of the undervalued dividend stocks to buy in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nBenchmark Electronics (BHE) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSmall-cap powerhouse Benchmark Electronics (NYSE:BHE) is on a roll this year, up 41% and stands 51% higher over the last 12 months. The semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer is an under-the-radar play on artificial intelligence. It provides product design, engineering, technology and manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and also serves the aerospace, defense and medical industries.\n\nThe proliferation of AI across the semiconductor industry but also throughout the other markets it serves, created a sales explosion for Benchmark. Semiconductor sales, its largest market, enjoyed a 12% increase in revenue but was dwarfed by a 35% surge in aerospace sales. Adjusted profits grew 8% to 55 cents per share.\n\nAlthough it initiated its first quarterly dividend in 2018, at 15 cents per share, it is slowly increasing the payout and its starting yield is a respectable 1.7% annually. It sports a free cash flow (FCF) payout ratio of just 24%, suggesting there is sufficient room for further growth in the future.\n\nUniversal (UVV) image of hands holding handful of processed tobacco\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hidden gem is Universal (NYSE:UVV), the world\u2019s largest supplier of tobacco leaf. It counts as customers all the major cigarette manufacturers including Altria (NYSE:MO), British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) but also supplies China Tobacco International, the world\u2019s largest cigarette maker.\n\nThat is key to Universal\u2019s future growth trajectory because although smoking is on a secular decline in the U.S., it continues to grow in China. Statista estimates the market there will reach \u201ca staggering $282.9 billion\u201d this year and continue growing at 1.6% annually through 2029.\n\nUniversal has a 54-year history of raising its dividend, making it a Dividend King. It has increased the payout at a near-5% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the past decade and the dividend yields a juicy 6.8% annually.\n\nYet recognizing the declining industry here at home, Universal is diversifying its business. It moved into the plant-based ingredients and food products business, and though the segment is still small, it is enjoying expanding opportunities. President and CEO George Freeman said Universal \u201centered several new partnerships to supply innovative products that capitalize on our newly developed capabilities and portfolio across our three ingredients companies.\u201d\n\nCardinal Health (CAH) Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMedical supplies and drug distributor Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) is an industry behemoth, though just the third largest supplier. It had about $190 billion in U.S. drug sales last year, fully one-quarter of the total market. Along with Cencora (NYSE:COR) and McKesson (NYSE:MCK), the trio supply 90% of the market.\n\nCardinal serves nearly 90% of all U.S. hospitals, more than 60,000 U.S. pharmacies and over 10,000 specialty physician offices and clinics. It also provides more than 3.4 million patients with more than 46,000 home healthcare products.\n\nWhile inflation and supply chain constraints hurt segment sales and profits in fiscal 2023, inflation has eased since then and the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates before the end of the year. So although it will face similar headwinds for a while yet, they should decrease going forward. Beyond that, Cardinal should be able to raise prices and benefit from an improving economy.\n\nCardinal also pays a dividend that it has increased for 27 consecutive years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat. The payout yields 2.1% a year.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas industry middleman Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is admittedly not a stock for everyone. Although it has a very attractive business model that ensures steady revenue flows, its organization as a master limited partnership (MLP) complicates an investment.\n\nMLPs are an investment class holding immense long-term income and profit potential but there are complex tax issues investors should consider before buying in.\u00a0 Because MLPs are required by law to distribute 90% or more of their profits to investors as dividends, they introduce more complicated tax considerations. But if it is an investment you can make, Enterprise Products Partners is one to consider. Those dividends yield a very healthy 7.3%.\n\nThe storage and pipeline transportation owner makes money no matter which way the oil and gas markets go. Operating on long-term fixed contracts, Enterprise Products Partners gets paid whether its customers take the product or not.\n\nWith oil and gas having long-term tailwinds behind it, Enterprise Products is among the undervalued dividend stocks to buy today.\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second-largest defense contractor is RTX (NYSE:RTX), formerly known as Raytheon but it changed its name after merging with United Technologies. It manufactures numerous defense systems, though missile systems are the workhorse of its business.\n\nRTX produces the Patriot missile system, Stinger and Javelin missiles, high-speed, anti-radiation missiles (HARMS) and national surface-to-air missile systems (NASAMS). It ended 2023 with a record backlog of orders totaling $196 billion. That grew to $202 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe war in Ukraine fuels a lot of the demand for RTX weapons systems. During the quarter it booked $282 million for NASAMS for Ukraine but also booked $1.6 billion for Patriot systems for Germany, $818 million for Patriot-guided enhance missiles (GEM-T) for NATO and another $874 million for various international GEM-T orders.\n\nRTX pays a dividend of $2.46 that yields 2.6% annually. It has paid a dividend every year since 1936 and has raised it for 30 consecutive years, so it should be considered among undervalued dividend stocks.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nComing full circle, Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) is the next dividend stock to buy as it has become the premier EV manufacturer. Although Tesla may sell more EVs than Toyota, the Japanese automaker correctly read the market well before anyone else and went all-in on the hybrid market. It is the best electric vehicle manufacturer today without exception.\n\nToyota saw a dramatic 20% surge in first-quarter sales volume. For the first half of 2024, EV sales took off even more, surging 68% and representing over 38% of total sales. It sold more than 454,000 electrified vehicles in the first six months of the year (it does make BEVs too). Overall, Toyota remains the world\u2019s biggest automobile manufacturer. The carmaker also noted its Lexus brand recorded its best-ever first half in its 35-year history.\n\nDespite Toyota stock being up 12% year-to-date and 25% for the last 12 months, shares trade at just 8 times trailing earnings, 9 times estimates and at a fraction of its sales. Wall Street expects earnings to maintain their strong 16% CAGR for the next five years. Its dividend also yields an attractive 2.7% a year making Toyota the top undervalueddividend stock to buy in July.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MO, CAH and RTX stock.

        "content": "The current state of the U.S. economy is somewhat optimistic yet still filled with uncertainties and risks, making it an excellent moment to uncover overvalued stocks to sell. On one hand, cautious optimism is supported by the Federal Reserve\u2019s projected rate cut, which might lead to more accommodating financial conditions later in the year.\n\nHowever, the GDPNow model by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has predicted a very low real GDP growth of 1.5% for the second quarter of 2024. This is a small drop from prior predictions, reflecting a more constrained economic expansion than previously anticipated. Additionally, with pandemic reserves running low and prices remaining high, everyone must reconsider their spending habits.\n\nThis scenario calls for reassessing the valuation of these three overvalued stocks to sell, which appear to be overextended and will struggle to maintain their high prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOvervalued Stocks to Sell: Carvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA) automobile dealership vending machine. Carvana is an online-only used car dealer.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA) epitomizes the volatility risks tied to overvalued stocks. First, it plummeted to the lowest levels during the pandemic and then rose rapidly as the market shifted toward a tech-focused approach.\n\nImpressively, it skyrocketed by an astonishing 1,000% in 2023, and the rate hasn\u2019t tapered off this year, with a robust surge of 144%. Despite these gains, the company narrowly avoided bankruptcy last year by\u00a0restructuring its debt. However, it continues to grapple with a humongous debt load of $5.3 billion, highlighting the seriousness of its financial challenges.\n\nAdditionally, the company has never been able to consistently make money, not even during one of the greatest economic periods in history, characterized by high consumer spending. Additionally, its trailing year price-to-earnings (PE) ratio exceeds 75x, which, of course, is an unsustainable level.\n\nThese factors are quite worrying and put into question its resilience and capacity to continue growing in the future.\n\nTelsa (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt will be interesting to see how luxury sectors, especially electric vehicles, adjust as we sift through the shifting economic tides. Although Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) enjoys a first-mover advantage with its advanced technology and extensive supercharger network, the high price of its stock has affected consumer purchasing decisions.\n\nCurrently, the stock trades at $262 and has a forward PE ratio of 103x, around seven times more than the sector median. This significant premium could sway consumers away from high-cost items.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla shares perked up after it reported producing 410,831 vehicles and handing over the keys for 443,956 in the second quarter. Yet, even with these impressive numbers, the production has dipped by 14.35%, and deliveries have slid by 4.76% compared to last year.\n\nThat performance impacted the financials, as Tesla\u2019s Q1 snapshot shows an 8.5% decrease in revenue year-over-year (YOY). The downturn points to broader challenges, suggesting sustaining growth could be tougher than anticipated.\n\nBoeing (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is facing some serious headwinds, with its stock value taking a sharp 29% dip this year. The drop reflects growing investor concerns, primarily fueled by ongoing safety issues. The Alaska Airlines 737-9 incident earlier this year led to the grounding of this model and sparked intense Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspections, revealing deeper quality control problems that are slowing production and delaying key certifications.\n\nThe impact has been brutal financially. Boeing\u2019s Q1 2024 financials reflect a disturbing net loss of $355 million, with revenue down $1.35 billion. Moreover, the company\u2019s forward PE ratio of 421x is more than 20-fold above the industry average and overly bullish, given the company\u2019s risks and volatility. It suggests a no-win situation where investors can suffer major setbacks.\n\nLastly, Boeing\u2019s guilty plea for deceiving authorities about the 737 MAX disasters weighs heavily on its shoulders. This criminal conviction carries severe sanctions and hinders Boeing\u2019s road to recovery, casting serious concerns over its ethical position.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Reasons Investors Should Not Hope for a Comeback in Nio Stock",
        "content": "Government incentives and shifts in consumer preferences have guided the momentous rise in NIO (NYSE:NIO) stock over the past several years. Nio\u2019s revenue exceeded $7.8 billion for FY2023, but it\u2019s losing its spark.\n\nA beleaguered economy in China coupled with intense competition have made it hard for the smaller EV maker to not just grow sales significantly, but it has also been difficult to improve profitability and margins. NIO stock has dropped 55% in the past year, and the outlook is unfavorable.\n\nCompetitive Risks Remain Despite Delivery Record\n\nIn the beginning of June, there was a lot of investor noise about NIO\u2019s May deliveries. According to a press statement, NIO delivered 20,544 vehicles that month, which represented a large year-over-year increase of 233.8%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Chinese EV maker also noted, \u201cthe deliveries consisted of 12,164 premium smart electric SUVs, and 8,380 premium smart electric sedans.\u201d\n\nAs of the end of May, NIO\u2019s cumulative deliveries figure stands at 515,811. NIO\u2019s SUVs, which include the ES6, ES7, and ES8 models, appear to be the carmaker\u2019s most popular vehicles.\n\nA year\u2019s worth of data point to the fact that NIO\u2019s SUV deliveries have, by and large, stayed ahead of sedan deliveries.\n\nDespite these impressive numbers, investors should not get too sidetracked here. The largest players in the Chinese market are still BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), all of which command a larger market share and are intent in growing it.\n\nConsumer electronics giant Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACY) is a recent entrant into the market that should make NIO uncomfortable.\n\nXiaomi began delivering its electric SU7 sedan in April with, 7000 deliveries, and May figures jumped 22% sequentially to 8,630 delivered vehicles.\n\nThe reality is that\u2019s not too far from where Nio\u2019s monthly deliveries are, and it is quite possible Xiaomi catches up especially as the company substantially expands production.\n\nNio\u2019s Avoidance of \u201cPrice Wars\u201d Could Hurt It\n\nThe intense competition going on in China\u2019s EV market has resulted in a hotly contested bout of price warring.\n\nIn a May article, Hong Kong-based newspaper the South China Morning Post provided context, asserting, \u201cBYD, the world\u2019s largest EV builder, fired the first salvo in the price war in February, slashing the prices of nearly all of its cars by 5 to 20 percent to accelerate a transition from petrol vehicles to electric cars on the mainland.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nio has, thus far, refused to engage in the ongoing price wars. In particular, CEO and founder William Li said to the press, \u201cWe will keep prices stable.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s good to stop here and note, Nio does largely play in the upper-end segment of the car market with prices that are above 300,000 yuan or ~$41,250.\n\nNot being willing to cut prices makes sense from a business standpoint for NIO, but as other large EV makers with well-built and sleek vehicles cut prices, NIO could face even more competitive pressure and perhaps even lose out on medium- and long-term growth.\n\nTariffs Could Hurt Nio Stock\n\nTensions between China and the United States have been brewing since the Trump Administration began a trade war many years ago. The current Biden administration has largely kept that geopolitical posture intact.\n\nDespite all the rhetoric about the need to safeguard the climate, in May, the administration announced a new array of tariffs on different kinds of Chinese goods, most notably Chinese-made solar cells and electric vehicles.\n\nIn particular, the White House imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs. The European Union appears to be following suit here, introducing provisional tariffs of up to 38% tariffs on Chinese EVs.\n\nNio has regarded the EU as an important international market and said back in May that the EV maker would pursue its European expansion strategy despite tariff risks.\n\nNio could be most at risk here because its vehicles compete with BMW\u2019s X5 and Audi\u2019s Q7 in terms of price range, while BYD and other EV makers are making cars that would still be cheaper in price even with the tariffs in place.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) and positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "History Says These 3 AI Stocks Could Be Big Winners in the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The stock market's rally shows no signs that it will be ending anytime soon. Investors remain bullish on artificial intelligence (AI), and with the possibility that the Fed will cut interest rates later this year, there could still be catalysts that drive stock prices higher in the months ahead.\n\nIf you're looking for AI-related stocks that could do well in the latter half of the year, consider Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). These companies have historically done well during second halves, and they could be good buys right now.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia is an easy pick for investors these days simply because the company is at the forefront of just about anything related to AI. The company's powerful GPUs put it in an excellent position to keep benefiting from rising AI-related expenditures. And it's still innovating. Earlier this year, Nvidia unveiled its new Blackwell chips, which will be its best and most efficient yet for training AI models.\n\nThe company generated nearly $40 billion in free cash flow over its past four reported quarters, and it has plenty of resources at its disposal to continue investing in its business and enhancing its products and services even further. That's why many analysts and investors remain bullish on the company, even though its market cap now tops $3.3 trillion.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia has done well in the latter part of the year. Here's a look at its second-half returns over the past 10 years.\n\nAverage 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 33.1% 17.1% (3.6%) 47% 37.5% 43.3% (43.7%) 33.9% 127.1% 63.9% 8.1%\n\nSource: YCharts.\n\nThere have been some big Q3 and Q4 moves for Nvidia in the past, but I wouldn't hold out hope for another scorching performance in the latter half of 2024 simply because the stock's valuation is already high. But with many catalysts still out there, this is an easy AI stock to justify buying and holding.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, or AMD, isn't nearly as popular as Nvidia, but it could make for an underrated AI investment. The company was a bit late to the AI chip game, but its new hardware entries are solid. Tech giants including Microsoft and Meta Platforms plan to make use of these lower-priced alternatives to Nvidia's chips.\n\nSome companies may also want to buy AMD chips simply to reduce their dependence on a single supplier. The proof will eventually be in the results, which so far have been a bit underwhelming. During the first quarter, AMD's revenue rose by just 2% year over year to $5.5 billion. But if demand for its AI chips proves to be strong, the second half could indeed be a good one for AMD. Here's how its stock has done in the latter halves of previous years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAverage 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 30.2% 29.4% (15.3%) 53.2% 74.3% 51% 23.2% (17.6%) 120.6% 19.6% (36.3%)\n\nAMD averages a return of more than 30% in the second half, which is only slightly lower than Nvidia's gains. Investors who want to diversify their semiconductor positions beyond Nvidia or who are concerned about its high valuation may want to pick up AMD, which certainly has the potential to post some strong results in upcoming quarters.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla shares are up just 3% so far this year, and that's with the help of a recent rally. The company is a leading electric vehicle (EV) maker, and automation is a big part of its business, but it has also been working on robotics and other AI technologies. CEO Elon Musk dreams big, so to label Tesla as just an automotive stock would miss the big picture.\n\nFor now, however, conditions in the EV market are going to heavily influence how the stock performs. Both macroeconomic and company-specific headwinds have been weighing on Tesla, at least in the near term. But it recently reported better-than-expected delivery numbers for the second quarter, which has helped ignite some bullishness around the stock again. That may suggest that its financial results for Q2, due to be reported later this month, will be better than feared. In Q1 2024, the company's revenue declined by 9% to $21.3 billion and its operating income plummeted by 56% to less than $1.2 billion.\n\nBut if its upcoming earnings show improvement and Tesla's robotaxi event scheduled for August proves to be a positive catalyst, investors could have multiple reasons to feel bullish about the stock. And consider Tesla's track record for the back half of the year:\n\nAverage 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 28.5% (5.1%) (45.1%) 55.5% 226.8% 87.2% (3%) (13.9%) 0.7% (10.5%) (7.4%)\n\nSource: yCharts.\n\nTesla isn't nearly as consistent as AMD or Nvidia. It's had some tough years. But it also shows that given the proper catalysts, Tesla is has the potential for large swings in value that could make the second half a winner for investors.\n\nFor AI investors and Musk fans, the stock's reduced valuation could present a timely opportunity to buy it to hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Rivian Stock Alert: VW Partnership Masks Deeper EV Market Woes",
        "content": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is in the middle of a tremendous run higher. A partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) will infuse billions into the electric vehicle automaker and give it an ownership stake in the company.\n\nThe EV industry itself is showing life, with many automakers reporting robust deliveries for the second quarter. Many are reading this as the reported death of electric cars is greatly exaggerated.\n\nYet Rivian itself isn\u2019t really benefiting, at least not with its electric SUVs. The VW deal is for Rvian\u2019s software and its own second-quarter deliveries growth was modest at best. The EV maker has said it wants to return to its original dual-track strategy but one of those tracks may be more valuable than the other and EVs just might not be it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA New Lease on Life?\n\nThe big news that sent Rivian stock off to the races, of course, was the partnership with Volkswagen. The German automaker is investing $2 billion into a joint venture with Rivian as cash and loans. It is establishing a $1 billion equity stake in the EV maker now, and will invest an additional $2 billion into Rivian stock over the next two years.\n\nIn exchange, Rivian will develop next generation software-defined vehicle (SDV) platforms to be used by both company\u2019s EVs. The cash influx will certainly allow Rivian to continue operating for years to come.\n\nAlthough I have previously cautioned against buying RIVN stock, I also warned against shorting its shares. I recently wrote, \u201cYet because Rivian has $6.8 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, I wouldn\u2019t short the stock. The SUV maker is not going out of business tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAnd that cash balance was before the VW deal. The EV maker has sufficient liquidity and it will be around for years.\n\nSwimming Against the Tide\n\nThe issue for Rivian is there remains a demand problem for EVs. After Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ignited a price war by cutting prices on its Model 3 and Model Y, other automakers followed suit, dramatically cutting prices. It caused the hoped-for bounce in sales, but that is not sustainable.\n\nTesla had to resort to additional incentives for buyers to purchase its EVs. It offered low-interest financing and lower cost lease terms, and it still saw deliveries drop 5% year-over-year. It was better than the falloff Wall Street was expecting, but it shows just how weak the market is.\n\nSimilarly, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) had to significantly cut prices on its luxury vehicles to move them. While deliveries surged 70% year-over-year the high-end EV maker still has a substantial backlog of unsold vehicles sitting on dealer lots.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, where Tesla is profitable and can afford to see its margins narrow by cutting prices and introducing more incentives, Lucid and Rivian are not. They are already losing tens of thousands of dollars on every car produced and price cuts will only worsen the situation.\n\nHedging Your Bets\n\nRivian delivered 13,790 EVs in the second quarter, only 1.5% more than it delivered in the first quarter. They were actually down 1.3% from the year ago figure. While it was more than the 13,000 to 13,300 EVs Rivian forecast, the slowdown was not completely unexpected as the EV maker closed its manufacturing plant for a period for upgrades.\n\nThe automaker maintains it will produce 57,000 vehicles this year and will achieve gross profitability on every vehicle sold by the fourth quarter. This will happen because of cost-savings arising from the plant upgrade. It lost nearly $39,000 on each SUV sold in the second quarter.\n\nPart of the VW partnership could include joint production at Rivian\u2019s plant. Investors Business Daily reports a German news outlet says VW\u2019s U.S. EV, the Scout, could be produced there.\n\nInvestors, though, have no reason to jump in now and buy the stock. They should wait to see if Rivian\u2019s plans really come to fruition.\n\nIt may continue to be the real value in Rivian stock lies in its vehicle software rather than its EVs. As that would fundamentally change the nature of its business, staying on the sidelines is the best approach to RIVN stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla stock is firmly back in the Magnificent Seven\u2014even as its EV market share slides",
        "content": "Tesla\u2019s competition is fiercer than ever. That has done little, however, to quell a massive rally in the company's stock price that has erased year-to-date losses and quieted for now questions of whether it still deserves to be part of the Magnificent Seven\u2014a movie-inspired term that describes the tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia are the others) that account for the lion's share of the stock market's gains in recent years.\n\nWhen Tesla shares dipped as low as $138.80 in April, however, Tesla barely clung to its place on the list of America's top 10 largest companies. Pundits like CNBC's Jim Cramer had already declared that the company had vacated its seat among some of the country's most powerful and fastest-growing companies.\n\nBoosted by Q2 deliveries that exceeded low expectations, however, Tesla\u2019s massive rally continued Wednesday as shares traded at their highest level since September, closing the day at $263.26. Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is now approaching $850 billion. That makes Tesla the eighth-largest U.S. company, though it still sits well-behind the $1.3 trillion market cap of Meta, the next-smallest member of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs Fortune\u2019s Christiaan Hetzner noted earlier this week, Tesla bulls may see the firm as an artificial intelligence company, but it still needs to prove it can sell cars for now\u2014a proposition that might be in doubt given a New York Times report, citing Cox Automotive, that Tesla no longer controls a majority of the American EV market.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an equities strategist at Morningstar, told Fortune that he never believed focusing on Tesla\u2019s EV market share was a good idea. As overall demand for electric vehicles climbs, he noted, Tesla\u2019s market share should fall even if the company continues to grow.\n\n\u201cI think the more important number is, what are their deliveries and what's their percent of the total auto market, including internal combustion engines?\u201d Goldstein said.\n\nTesla's deliveries beat expectations\n\nAt the beginning of the month, Tesla announced it had delivered almost 444,000 vehicles in Q2, just under a 5% drop from last year. As Hetzner noted last week, analysts had estimated that drop would be around 9%.\n\nThat number impressed Goldstein as did the record numbers from Tesla\u2019s energy storage business. The company said it deployed 9.4 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage, its highest quarterly number yet and more than double the amount reported in Q1. Even small changes in expectations for high-growth stocks, Goldstein said, can heavily impact share prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat shows that Tesla can still grow,\u201d Goldstein said. \u00a0\"It shows that maybe the worst is behind Tesla, and that they are turning things around.\u201d\n\nAwaiting news on robo-taxis and affordable vehicles\n\nInvestors may also be looking forward to Aug. 8, when Tesla is scheduled to reveal its Cybercab, the robo-taxi model expected to lack a steering wheel and pedals. Goldstein is curious if the unveiling features a concrete timeline or instead offers few details.\n\nIn the more immediate future, Goldstein wants to hear more about Tesla\u2019s progress on producing a new, more affordable vehicle when the company hosts its next earnings call on July 23. Musk has said production could start as soon as 2025, which Goldstein said would enable deliveries to start growing again by 2026.\n\nHe thinks the market will react positively if that timeline remains intact.\n\n\u201cIf they don't commit to it again or give us any updates,\u201d he said, \u201cwe could see the stock falter.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The walls are closing in on Tesla: EV makers just took a bite out of its market share, and investor Bill Gross says it\u2019s a meme stock now",
        "content": "Tesla\u2019s market share is plummeting, and at least one seasoned investor says it looks more like a meme stock than a member of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s electric car company, which has long dominated the U.S. EV market, made up less than 50% of U.S. EV sales for the first time ever in the second quarter, according to a soon-to-be-released report by research firm Cox Automotive. The EV maker\u2019s U.S. sales fell 6.3% in the quarter, Cox estimated, even as overall EV sales in the country jumped 11.3% year over year.\n\nThe company\u2019s lagging performance is partly due to increasing competition from legacy carmakers, according to the report. In recent years General Motors and Hyundai-Kia have both released long-range electric vehicles that can travel 300 miles on a single charge.\n\nWhile a decade ago Tesla was one of the only options for EV buyers, the carmaker has had to cut its prices several times over the past year to compete with new EVs released at prices that rival those of gas-powered cars. In the coming months, GM is set to launch an electric version of the Chevy Equinox at about $35,000 before taking into account a $7,500 federal tax credit. Also in the works is a $25,000 electric Jeep that Stellantic CEO Carlos Tavares said in May would be coming to the U.S. \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s share of U.S. EV sales has fallen, the company\u2019s stock price has rebounded after starting the year as the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500. Tesla shares are up just over 7% year to date, but are still down about 2% year over year. In just the past five trading days, the company\u2019s shares have shot up more than 15% after the company last week reported a smaller drop in sales for the second quarter than analysts expected.\n\nThe company\u2019s miraculous stock performance in light of lagging sales has led bond king Bill Gross to claim Tesla is the new GameStop.\n\n\u201cTesla acting like a meme stock\u2014sagging fundamentals, straight up price action,\u201d the Pimco founder posted on X Tuesday. \u201cBut then there seems to be a new meme stock every other day now. Most are pump and dump.\u201d\n\nSome Tesla bulls, including Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, have claimed Tesla shares could continue to increase because it\u2019s more of an AI and robotics company than a car company. Still, those high expectations will either be fulfilled or crushed with Musk\u2019s promised robo-taxi announcement in August.\n\nFor now, despite its stock price, Tesla faces increased competition and an uncertain future, according to Cox Automotive\u2019s industry insights director Stephanie Valdez Streaty.\n\n\u201cWhile Tesla\u2019s sales continue to decline, with its share of EV sales now below 50% for the first time, the overall electric vehicle competitive landscape intensifies further. This is leading to continued price pressure, helping push EV adoption slowly higher,\u201d Valdez Streaty said in a statement. \u201cAutomakers that deliver the right product, at the right price, and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in adoption.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Momentum Stocks That Could Still Have More Room to Run",
        "content": "In a stock market that\u2019s somewhat lacking in volatility, value investors are sure to find other things to be anxious about. Indeed, momentum is growing behind a wide range of names, especially those in tech with artificial intelligence (AI) plans and products under development.\n\nFor some value-conscious folks, the magnitude of momentum driven by an emerging technological trend may be enough to keep them glued to the bleachers. Momentum may be scary for value-conscious crowds, as volatility is for short-term traders. Yet, investors could miss out by not jumping into the game despite the higher admission prices.\n\nMany of the market\u2019s leading momentum plays in tech are being driven not just by upbeat sentiment but improving fundamentals. Let\u2019 delve into three high flyers with solid legs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location with doors open)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) continues to ride high, as the stock is up over 400% in the past year. The best part is that retail play, which had its heyday over 15 years ago, still looks more like a value play at less than 23 times trailing P/E.\n\nTruly, management has had phenomenal turnaround. But sometimes, it\u2019s changes in consumer behavior and tastes that are responsible for sudden and sharp sales surges. It can be challenging to predict when a mature market leader (like Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) will implode and when a firm fashionable in a prior decade, like Abercrombie & Fitch, will come back from a lengthy hibernation.\n\nThough ANF stock looks like both a value and momentum stock, latecomers to ANF stock should be wary of the next phase of fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch is in today. But will it stay in next year? It\u2019s tough to say right now.\n\nHowever, there is still plenty of upside for the $9.1 billion mid-cap if it can stay stylish for a number of years as it did in the mid-2000s. Perhaps there\u2019s more to see from ANF\u2019s long-awaited encore as management does its best to keep customers (like those in the Gen Z cohort) coming back to its stores.\n\nCadence Design Systems (CDNS) A Cadence corporate office building has a sign with the company logo out front\n\nSource: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) is one of the red-hot AI winners. Indeed, the stock has been on a blistering run, up nearly 100% in the past two years. However, the run has been dwarfed by the likes of Nvidia and other hardware-focused design firms.\n\nIndeed, Cadence Design Systems stand behind the curtain of the AI boom. And while it may not get as much credit as the performers on the stage, it still deserves a round of applause for playing its vital part. For those unfamiliar with Cadence, it\u2019s a chip design software developer whose role will only get more important as the semiconductor process shrinks and efficient design becomes harder to achieve without a bit of help from AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late June, analysts at Baird praised chip design companies like Cadence as having \u201ccompetitive moats.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. The strong AI-driven growth prospects and solid economic positioning warrant the hefty 82.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been one of the hottest stocks over the past few weeks, rocketing more than 50% in the past month and 20% in just this past week. The opportunity to buy TSLA stock on the multi-year dip came and went rather quickly.\n\nWith the company\u2019s robotaxi event less than a month away, it\u2019s not hard to imagine many folks looking for it to act as a catalyst that could help power new all-time highs. The big question is whether August 8 (the date of Tesla\u2019s looming robotaxi event) will result in a sell-the-news scenario or a continuation of the massive TSLA stock melt-down.\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven members have already broken out in a big way this year. It may be Tesla\u2019s turn. Tesla and SpaceX\u2019s top boss, Elon Musk, attempts to remind us all that Tesla is an AI company, not just a mere auto company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley raised its valuation for Tesla's energy storage business, expecting a global surge in demand for power driven by the artificial-intelligence boom, and the company's ability to grow its market share in the segment.\n\nThe brokerage lifted the value of the unit at $50 per share of its $310 price target, up from its previous estimate of $36 apiece, while reducing its forecast for Tesla's 2030 auto sales.\n\nIt estimates that the profit generated from a fully utilized megafactory, which manufactures large-storage batteries, is equal to that from selling 1 million Tesla vehicles.\n\n\"It's no wonder that investors are starting to consider the real possibility that Tesla Energy may be worth more than Tesla Auto,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said.\n\nTesla shares have surged nearly 44% in the past 10 sessions, their longest streak in more than a year, after a dour start to the year.\n\nThe daily trading turnover for Tesla shares overtook AI darling Nvidia last week for the first time in six months, per LSEG data.\n\nOppenheimer said in a note on Tuesday it expects to see Tesla's energy storage sales to surpass $3 billion in the current quarter, but added that \"the value of its full-self driving /AI platform is the key to whether shares will continue moving higher or begin to moderate again.\"\n\nIn April, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla would likely launch full-self driving software this year, which would be a big profit generator.\n\nTesla deployed 9.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in the second quarter of 2024, more than double of that in the January-March period.\n\nIts products include the Powerwall home power backup system, and Megapack, meant for large-scale commercial projects and utilities.\n\nEnergy storage and generation accounted for 6% of Tesla's 2023 revenue, and the rest came from the auto segment, according to LSEG data.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) industry continues to evolve rapidly, with significant trends shaping its future in 2024. Despite some fluctuations in consumer demand, the global market for EVs remains robust. Key trends include a steady increase in EV sales, driven by technological advancements and supportive regulatory frameworks to reduce emissions. This backdrop forms my list of three undervalued EV stocks to buy.\n\nMoreover, competition among manufacturers intensifies, leading to price cuts and improved consumer affordability. This trend is particularly evident in China, where domestic companies leverage an integrated supply chain to offer competitively priced models\u200b.\n\nFor those interested in investment opportunities, the current market dynamics suggest several undervalued EV stocks to consider. I\u2019ve compiled a list of three companies that I feel will be the leaders of tomorrow. These companies trade at attractive valuations and could be long-term winners for patient investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) has seen a significant sequential decline in revenue and profits from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. While this drop is attributed to seasonality factors around the Chinese New Year holiday, a 30.6% quarterly decrease in revenue and a 47.33% fall in net income are still quite steep. The year-over-year growth figures of 3.97% for revenue and 10.62% for net profits are more positive but not exceptionally strong.\n\nStill, despite this short-term weakness, BYDD will remain a dominant force in the EV space amid recent developments, making it one of the top undervalued EV stocks to buy.\n\nThe company signed a deal to open a $1 billion EV factory in Turkey. The new factory, which will have an annual capacity of 150,000 electric cars and an R&D center, is part of BYD\u2019s international expansion strategy and strengthens its presence in Europe.\n\nBYD also aims to sell affordable EVs in Europe, such as the Seagull, estimated to cost around 20,000 euros each. Due to its scale and ability to undercut and outscore its more expensive competitors, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), it may remain the largest EV manufacturer.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has shown resilience, steady delivery growth and strong financials. The company focuses on expanding its model lineup and technological advancements.\n\nLI could be considered one of those undervalued EV stocks for a few reasons. Li Auto did report year-over-year growth in Q1 2024, with revenues increasing 36.4% and gross profit rising 38% compared to Q1 2023. The company also maintained a healthy gross margin of 20.6%. Additionally, management provided relatively upbeat guidance for Q2 2024, forecasting 21-27% year-over-year delivery growth and a 4-9% revenue increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13x and a forward P/E of 20x, Li Auto\u2019s valuation multiples are quite low for a company growing revenues and profits rapidly. Many fast-growing companies trade at significantly higher P/E ratios. The price-to-sales ratio of 1.10 also suggests the stock is cheap relative to its top line.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), known for its luxury electric vehicles, focuses on increasing manufacturing efficiency and expanding market reach.\n\nThere are a few reasons LCID is among the undervalued EV stocks for investors. Lucid\u2019s advanced EV technology, luxury branding and backing from the Saudi Public Investment Fund position it well to capture a meaningful share of the premium EV market. The company\u2019s revenue growth forecast of 70.62% over the next five years indicates that analysts expect strong top-line expansion as Lucid scales up production and sales.\n\nLucid\u2019s market cap of $7.29 billion is still a fraction of that of Tesla, the EV industry leader. If Lucid can execute its growth strategy and capture even a small portion of Tesla\u2019s market share, its upside potential could be significant.\n\nThe company has $3.99 billion in cash and equivalents, resulting in a net cash position of $1.91 billion or 83 cents per share. This cash cushion should help Lucid fund its expansion plans and weather potential challenges as it ramps up operations, which positions it attractively for the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Cheapest Electric Car for 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a comprehensive report detailing the 15 Cheapest Electric Cars & SUVs for 2024. In this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at the electric vehicle market and the cheapest electric car for 2024.\n\nOverview of the Electric Vehicle Market\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is playing a vital role in the global transition to sustainable transportation. Rising consumer interest in eco-friendly transportation options has led to a surge in demand for electric vehicles. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) EV sales have been growing rapidly, reaching nearly 14 million units in 2023, 95% of which were in China, the US, and Europe. In the US, sales of electric cars increased by over 40% in 2023 to reach a sales share of about 10% of the total vehicle market. The share of electric cars in global vehicle sales has also increased significantly, rising from around 4% in 2020 to 18% in 2023. This momentum is expected to continue through 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, more than 3 million electric cars were sold, representing an increase of about 25% compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nCar manufacturers around the world are shifting their product focus and investment towards electric vehicles. This strategic shift is driven by the growth in EV sales. General Motors Company\u2019s (NYSE:GM) EV sales in the US surged in the second quarter of 2024, with deliveries reaching 21,930 units. This marks a 40% increase year-over-year and a 34% rise from the previous quarter. In the first half of 2024, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) delivered a record total of 38,355 electric vehicles. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) also saw impressive EV sales growth, with deliveries jumping 61% in Q2 to 23,957 units. The car manufacturer's EV sales for the first half of 2024 totaled 44,180 vehicles.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), one of the most valuable electric car companies in the world, delivered approximately 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 14% increase from the previous quarter. Despite being down nearly 5% from the same period in 2023, this figure exceeded most analysts' expectations.\n\nIn one of our previous articles about the largest automotive markets in the world, we discussed that China is heavily investing in EV production and Chinese manufacturers are emerging as major global players. These companies are disrupting the automotive market, both domestically and internationally, by offering affordable and technologically advanced EVs. However, on July 4, Bloomberg reported that the European Union has imposed additional tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese electric vehicles, on top of the existing 10% duty. This move is aimed at protecting the EU's domestic automotive industry, which the bloc claims is facing unfair competition from Chinese EVs that benefit from government subsidies. The tariffs will currently be provisional while the EU continues its investigation into China's support for its EV manufacturers. This decision is seen as a major blow to China's electric vehicle exports, as the EU is a crucial overseas market for the country's EV industry. The tariffs could lead to higher prices for EVs in the European market, potentially impacting affordability for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn July 8, Reuters reported that China\u2019s BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) rival and the largest EV producer in the world, has agreed to build a car factory in Turkey. The company will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will have an annual capacity of 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. Additionally, BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594) intends to establish a research and development center at the site focused on sustainable mobility technologies. It is important to note that Turkey is in a customs union with the European Union, which allows vehicles manufactured in Turkey to be exported to the EU without incurring tariffs.\n\nRivian: The Next Big Player in the EV Market?\n\nRivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is an American electric vehicle manufacturer and automotive technology company. The company develops and builds technologically advanced and innovative products and accessories with the goal of accelerating the global transition to zero-emission transportation. RIVN is one of the best EV stocks to buy for the long term.\n\nIn March, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) introduced its new midsize platform, which underpins R2 and R3 product lines. The R2 is a five-seat SUV that features a distinctive Rivian design and practical features like a powered rear glass hatch and flat-folding seats for cargo and camping. The R3 is a midsize crossover that promises strong performance, off-road capability, and ample passenger and storage space. R3X is a performance variant of R3, boasting enhanced capabilities for both on-road and off-road driving. The company has focused on cost-efficient manufacturing and design to price the R2 starting at around $45,000. R3 will be priced below R2, making these new models more accessible to a wider customer base. Built on Rivian\u2019s all-new midsize platform, R2 and R3 have been engineered to provide exceptional performance, range, and cost efficiency. This platform incorporates innovative design elements that consolidate and eliminate components. The use of high-pressure die castings, a structural battery pack that also serves as the floor, and simplified closure systems are some of the key features that contribute to enhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn its Q1 2024 earnings report, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported that the company exceeded its first-quarter delivery targets and successfully completed a major plant retooling upgrade. During the first quarter, the electric vehicle manufacturer produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588 units to customers. The company also announced the transition to a new zonal network architecture, which significantly reduced the number of electronic control units in its vehicles by approximately 60%, resulting in substantial cost savings. RIVN is making steady progress and the completion of the plant retooling upgrade positions the company to enhance production efficiency and meet growing customer demand for its innovative electric vehicles.\n\nOn June 25, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Volkswagen AG (ETR:VOW3) announced their intention to form a joint venture to develop advanced electrical architecture and software for their future electric vehicles. German automaker Volkswagen AG (ETR:VOW3), one of the biggest car manufacturers by revenue, will invest up to $5 billion in US electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). The partnership aims to combine the companies' complementary strengths to accelerate software development and reduce costs. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) will contribute its expertise in zonal hardware design and integrated technology, which will serve as the foundation for the joint venture's software-defined vehicle (SDV) platform. This investment and collaboration is expected to help Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) reduce costs related to vehicle components and materials. However, both automakers aim to achieve greater cost efficiencies in their EV programs by leveraging Rivian's innovative zonal electrical architecture and software expertise to enhance the technological capabilities of future electric vehicles. Both companies plan to launch EVs benefiting from this joint venture in the coming years. RJ Scaringe, CEO of Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), told Reuters that the investment will provide Rivian with the financial resources it needs to bring its more affordable and compact R2 SUV models to market in early 2026, as well as fund the development of its upcoming R3 crossover vehicles.\n\nInvestments in EV technology and manufacturing are expected to drive significant growth in the EV market. This joint venture underscores the industry's push towards more advanced, software-centric electric vehicle architectures.\n\nNow that we have discussed what\u2019s going on in the EV market, let\u2019s take a look at the cheapest electric cars & SUVs for 2024. This is the Cheapest Electric Car for 2024\n\nA row of electric cars being charged simultaneously at a public charging station.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe compiled a list of the 15 cheapest electric cars & SUVs for 2024. To collect data for our list of the cheapest electric vehicles available, we analyzed rankings of the cheapest electric vehicles on Car and Driver, InsideEVs, U.S. News & World Report, and TrueCar Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUE). We shortlisted electric cars and SUVs that were featured in at least two of these four rankings. We then ranked the 15 cheapest electric cars & SUVs based on their Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). This methodology allowed us to objectively determine the 15 cheapest electric cars and SUVs for 2024.\n\nThe Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for each vehicle was obtained directly from the manufacturer's official website. Please note that MSRP is subject to change over time. The prices listed reflect the data available on the collection date of July 4, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "3 Lawsuit-Laden Stocks to Dump Before Problems Multiply",
        "content": "A pending or ongoing lawsuit isn\u2019t always a reliable indicator of stocks to sell, but, in many cases, investors should take litigation as a sign to dig beneath the surface.\n\nI\u2019d first caution retail investors not to take pending litigation as a sure sign of failure or risk; tons of legal firms push frivolous lawsuits in a bid to maximize their own income. Even if the litigant\u2019s motives aren\u2019t nefarious, law firms bring suits against companies for other reasons beyond just a payout; for example, last year, a group of nuns suedSmith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWBI) for \u201cwrongdoing related to the marketing and sale of AR-15-style assault weapons.\u201d Likewise, Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) face near-constant lawsuits from minority shareholders \u2014 often with flimsy premises and thin evidence.\n\nStill, these stocks to sell combine the worst of both worlds: They\u2019re facing ongoing lawsuits, and in each of the three cases, the stock itself is a stinker.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoodRx (GDRX) Magnifying glass looking at the GoodRx logo on the company Website\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) is facing a fresh lawsuit claiming the company misrepresented Kroger\u2019s (NYSE:KR) total contributions to its revenue. Specifically, the suit claims that GoodRx didn\u2019t inform investors that \u201cKroger accounted for less than 5% of the pharmacies accepting GoodRx discounts [but] was responsible for nearly 25% of GoodRx\u2019s total prescription transactions revenue.\u201d This misalignment exposes GoodRx to undue risk and, while management can run their operations as they choose, exposing shareholders to this level of systemic risk isn\u2019t good business. In some ways, I\u2019d call this a frivolous lawsuit \u2014 with merit, yes, but ultimately not enough to count it among the ranks of stocks to sell.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only problem GoodRx faced in recent years.\n\nMore concerning to shareholders and customers alike is GoodRx\u2019s 2023 $1.5 million civil penalty assessed by the Federal Trade Commission for \u201cunauthorized disclosures of consumers\u2019 personal health information to Meta (NASDAQ:META), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and other companies.\u201d Taken in conjunction with the most recent lawsuit, GoodRx seems to consistently pull the wool over shareholders\u2019 eyes, Likewise, its past practice of actively \u201ccash[ing] in on consumers\u2019 extremely sensitive and personally identifiable health information\u201d is a clear violation of consumer trust, ultimately making GoodRx too risky for most portfolios and a strong candidate among stocks to sell.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) constantly faces lawsuits, the most well-known of which is the \u201cearplug lawsuit\u201d that found the company liable and compelled to pay a $6 billion personal injury settlement to affected parties. Beyond the pure payout, 3M is facing a $370 million legal defense bill \u2014 ultimately operating a money pit that\u2019s going to see shareholder value diverted toward legal costs rather than company growth, dividends, or buybacks.\n\nThat isn\u2019t all, of course. 3M also owes $10 billion to residents affected by the company\u2019s leeching \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water supplies. Payments toward this massive settlement begin next quarter and, as with the earplug suit, represent a company forced to focus on legal wrangling over operational expansion and dedicate capital toward payouts rather than benefiting shareholders.\n\nSurprisingly, 3M remained largely unaffected by the suits this year as shares have climbed 10% since January. This is due, in part, to an uncertainty principle: ongoing lawsuits have uncertain outcomes and create unknown risks for investors, whereas settlements and adjudicated suits have clearly defined costs that are more easily modeled. Still, with a slew of lawsuits in the rearview but likely more ahead, 3M is certainly a top contender among stocks to sell.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) isn\u2019t facing a lawsuit itself, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its risk and status among stocks to sell. Last month, investors filed suit against meme stock mega-star Keith Gill, who was originally a face of the movement that propelled GameStop to its massive highs and has recently reemerged as a major player. The litigants dissolved the suit earlier this month. Still, bad news of this type surrounding GameStop doesn\u2019t bode well for its future, particularly as the company itself remains on shaky ground with limited prospects beyond short-term meme stock status.\n\nThe company\u2019s cashing in on its recent bounce with a massively dilutive share offering is just one of many examples of management taking advantage of their unique position in the market; their position is understandable \u2014 may as well make hay while the sun shines \u2014 but also shows a clear disregard for the legions of current and future bagholders propping up the stock.\n\nI don\u2019t even need to get into GameStop\u2019s imminent operational concerns, which include job cuts amid slackening sales.

        "title": "Tesla's energy business is growing \u2014 and it could be company's next big earnings driver",
        "content": "When it comes to valuing and analyzing Tesla (TSLA) stock, Wall Street analysts \u2014 at least the bullish ones \u2014 say the company is more than an automaker. And one area of outsized growth for Tesla beyond its car business could be energy.\n\nIn its second quarter production and delivery report, Tesla said that it deployed 9.4 GWh (gigawatt hours) of battery energy storage, its highest quarterly amount ever, and more than double the amount of battery storage the company deployed in the first quarter. Fuel for growth? A Tesla Megapack energy storage unit. (Tesla.com) (Tesla)\n\nTesla\u2019s energy storage business, part of Tesla Energy, includes installations as small as Powerwall batteries for the home to massive Megapack storage facilities meant for utilities and municipalities to store large amounts of energy for deployment at peak energy usage times.\n\nWhile a Powerwall typically holds around 12.2 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, or enough to power a small home for a day, one Megapack installation can hold 3.9 megawatt-hours of energy, enough to power 3,600 homes for one hour, Tesla said.\n\nThough Tesla only booked $1.6 billion in revenue from its energy storage business in the first quarter, the company reported a healthy $403 million in gross profit from the business, good for a gross margin of 24.6%.\n\nTesla\u2019s overall gross profit was $3.7 billion in Q1, with a gross margin of 17.4%, which was down from 19.3% a year ago. The drop in gross margin was due to Tesla\u2019s EV price cuts, which were meant to spur demand and have been eating into profits over the past year.\n\nHere's why energy could be another catalyst for Tesla stock.\n\nTesla\u2019s auto business, which represents the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s revenue and profits, is now actually weighing on Tesla\u2019s overall gross margin, notwithstanding the positive effects of the growing profits and operational efficiency of its energy storage business.\n\nBut with Tesla doubling storage deployments in Q2 versus Q1, the effect on the company's bottom line could be substantial \u2014 and Wall Street is of course noticing the growth, and profit appeal, of Tesla\u2019s energy storage business.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas dubbed Tesla\u2019s Q2 energy deployment storage figure a \u201cshow stealer,\u201d noting the 9.4 GWh deployed was double the firm\u2019s forecast.\n\n\u201cWe believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the US electric grid accelerated by the AI boom,\u201d Jonas wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nMorgan Stanley has a $310 price target on Tesla.\n\nJonas believes generative AI spending and resulting buildouts will spur a \u201cmultigenerational increase in energy demand,\u201d electricity generation, and data center investment, and Tesla\u2019s energy storage business is poised to benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Jonas said clients have been asking Morgan Stanley more and more about the investment bank\u2019s Tesla Energy long-term business outlook, as well as its predictions for the Optimus robot unit, with an eye toward whether these two initiatives will be catalysts for Tesla beyond Q2.\n\nMuch of the \"why you should buy the stock\" story for Tesla has been centered on the launch of a lower-priced EV \u2014 and the reveal of its highly anticipated robotaxi on Aug. 8.\n\nBut it may be Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings report, coming in less than two weeks, that could provide investors with a nice upside surprise if the energy storage business reports another strong quarter of profitable growth.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Tesla, Li Auto, Nio and XPeng",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 10, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla Inc. TSLA, Li Auto Inc. LI, Nio Inc. NIO and XPeng Inc. XPEV.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nWhat Tesla's Recent Rally Implies for the Broader Market\n\nThe ongoing impressive rally of Wall Street is predominantly fueled by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths and the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d The latest example is Tesla Inc.. The stock price of the global giant in the electric vehicle (EV) space has appreciated more than 37% in the past nine trading sessions.\n\nThe recent rally started after Tesla announced that it delivered 443,956 units in second-quarter 2024, beating the consensus estimate of 439,302. Total production in the same quarter came in at 410,831. The stock price of Tesla fell 40% from the beginning of the year in mid-April after its first-quarter delivery of 386,810 units fell well below the consensus estimate of 449,080, marking its first year-over-year quarterly decline in deliveries since 2020.\n\nHowever, following the recent rally, the stock is in positive territory year to date. At this stage, the question is, will just a delivery beat in the second quarter induce such a big rally?\n\nHeadwinds Persist\n\nAlthough deliveries surged 14.8% sequentially, it is still down 4.8% year over year. Tesla is facing massive competition in its largest market, China. Its Chinese peers Li Auto Inc., Nio Inc. and XPeng Inc. delivered record EVs last quarter. Moreover, Tesla\u2019s aging lineup is a major concern.\n\nFollowing pathetic first-quarter deliveries, the EV behemoth announced that it will retrench 10% of its global workforce. The global EV space is quickly getting saturated. Apart from Chinese EV makers, Indian giants like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra are extensively serving the indigenous market as well as internationally.\n\nShrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. To stimulate sales, it has offered various discounts and incentives, such as zero-interest loans for Model 3 and Model Y purchases in China.\n\nLast month, CEO Elon Musk warned that deliveries and sales will remain tepid for the time being as the industry goes through a transitionary period. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling EV market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt present, Tesla\u2019s average price target of brokerage firms represents a downside risk of 28.8% from the last closing price of $252.94. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $22.86 to $310.\n\nNear-Term Tailwinds\n\nNevertheless, all is not bad for Tesla. The EV giant\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and AI is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture. The successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China is another positive.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. Tesla said that it deployed 9.4 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in the second quarter, reflecting its highest quarterly performance to date. This shows that Tesla is not just a simple EV manufacturer.\n\nAt present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate shows that Tesla\u2019s full-year 2024 earnings will plummet 20.5% year over year. However, earnings estimates for the current year have improved over the last 30 days.\n\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRally Says Bulls Will Roar\n\nThe Tesla rally clearly indicates that buy-on-the-dip should be the moto for Wall Street investors this year (read: Catch These 5 Big Fishes at Next Dips for Long-Term Gains).\n\nAny dip should be considered as a good buying opportunity. Just a single positive catalyst, such as a quarterly delivery beat by Tesla will lead to a spike in stock prices.\n\nThe bull run is expected to continue in the second half supported by a resilient U.S. economy, a declining inflation rate and solid earnings results. Wall Street participants have turned optimistic on interest rate cuts by the Fed following the recently released soft economic readings.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool currently shows a 77.1% probability of a Fed fund rate cut by 25 basis points in September. This probability was around 62% just a week ago. Moreover, the interest rate derivative tool also shows a 73.4% probability of two rate cuts by the end of 2024.\n\nA lower interest rate regime will boost economic growth, speeding up investments by businesses. Several companies depend on cheap sources of credit as the full potential of their business is realized over a long period.\n\nA low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate thereby increasing the net present value of investment in stocks. Additionally, the global supply-chain system has been restoring slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system\u2019s bypassing of China.\n\nWall Street has plenty of liquidity. At the beginning of 2024, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5% (read: Best Investment Strategy for 2024: Buy on the Dip).\n\nA systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Baidu\u2019s shares jumped by the most in more than a year and bullish options bets surged to a record on signs of growing popularity for its Apollo Go robotaxi in China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner Asia\u2019s Richest Banker Gets Caught in Adani-Hindenburg Crossfire\n\nThe stock rose as much as 13% in Hong Kong, following an 8.5% advance in the US on Tuesday. More than 48,000 calls changed hands, six times more than the 20-day average and double the number of bearish puts.\n\nChina\u2019s internet search leader is investing in generative AI and autonomous driving to diversify its business as the nation\u2019s economic growth slows and impacts advertisements. Traders are betting that robotaxis will get another push after the capital Beijing announced this week that it\u2019ll support them for ride hailing and car rental fleets.\n\n\u201cAutonomous driving will turn into a key trade in the coming three months, aided by Tesla\u2019s launch of its robotaxi next month,\u201d Guotai Junan International analyst Li Muhua wrote in a note. \u201cBaidu\u2019s Apollo Go is expected to break even in Wuhan in 2024 and be profitable in 2025 with an increase in its fleet in the city.\u201d\n\nTesla Inc. was recently granted approval to test its advanced driver-assistance system on some Shanghai streets, according to a person familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported last month. China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in late November it would allow pilot road tests for selected self-driving cars in designated areas.\n\nMore Tests\n\nApollo Go has started manned tests in 11 Chinese cities and is conducting unmanned auto driving tests in Beijing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shenzhen and Shanghai, Li wrote in the note, adding that operating costs will drop significantly. Baidu said in May Apollo Go should turn profitable by 2025.\n\nBaidu needs the lift, with its stock still down more than 17% this year, compared with a 2.5% gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. After reporting slowing revenue in the latest quarter, Baidu shares fell to their lowest price since November 2022 earlier this month.\n\nAs the stock sank, the cost of hedging against further declines also dropped. The measure known as skew is now near a three-year low, following a similar trend for options on the American Depositary Receipts. In the US, bullish options volume surged on Tuesday to its highest level since March 2021, with two opening block trades of calls betting on a 25% jump from the previous close changing hands at the ask, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBaidu is one of the leading autonomous driving system providers,\u201d said Phil S. Lee, head of Asia-Pacific research at Mirae Asset Global Investments in Hong Kong. \u201cIts key advantage is that it\u2019s open to many brands.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Somphote Ahunai, whose net worth topped $4.8 billion two years ago, is no longer a billionaire after a series of unwieldy efforts to diversify one of Thailand\u2019s biggest renewable-power producers into a Tesla-like transport specialist.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android S&P 500 Holds Gains as Fed Bets Steady on Powell: Markets Wrap The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner\n\nShares of Energy Absolute Pcl posted a record monthly drop of 51% in June, slashing Somphote\u2019s fortune to less than $600 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Even after a 11% rebound this month following Somphote\u2019s furious defense of the company\u2019s financial health, the stock has still lost about 70% of its value this year, the biggest decline among almost 1,400 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.\n\nThe tumble comes after several years of Somphote\u2019s efforts to replicate parts of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc.: an integrated business with electricity generation, battery production, car manufacturing and charging-point installation. Somphote also invested in assembly of electric trains, ferries and buses \u2014 borrowing heavily to fund his dreams.\n\n\u201cAll the efforts and bets on the EV industry are in serious doubt with ongoing price wars and oversupply,\u201d said Tiwa Shintadapong, president of Investors Association of Thailand. \u201cEnergy Absolute\u2019s earnings slump and negative cash flow have really diminished confidence among investors.\u201d\n\nSomphote, 57, called urgent press conferences on consecutive days last week to clarify the company\u2019s condition and try to calm shareholders and creditors. He defended Energy Absolute\u2019s aggressive push into battery production and transportation, while saying that the company has sufficient cash flow to service its 37 billion baht ($1 billion) debt.\n\nEnergy Absolute, founded as a palm oil and biodiesel specialist, spent billions to build production facilities for batteries as well as buses, ferries and trains under the Mine brand, as the Thai government joined the global push for emission cuts.\n\n\u201cEVs and the battery business are tougher than we anticipated, but we still have strong belief in their future,\u201d he said at one of the press conferences, where he urged investors who \u201care questioning the company\u2019s survival\u201d to look at fundamentals and market potential. Somphote\u2019s stake in the company dropped to slightly over 30% from about 40% after the stock\u2019s slide forced a foreign bank to sell some of his pledged shares to repay loans, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst-quarter profit slumped by 62% from a year earlier due in part to an end to government subsidies for electricity output at one of its solar power plants. EV sales in the three months through March also fell on lower demand for its electric buses.\n\nCash flow will swing into a surplus this year as most large investments on electric buses and trucks have been finished, according to Somphote.\n\nEnergy Absolute recorded a free-cash-flow shortfall of 7.3 billion baht in 2023, up from 1.7 billion baht a year earlier, even as net income was little changed at 7.6 billion baht, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, the power division \u2014 which has generating capacity of 664 megawatts \u2014 remains strong, with annual cash flow of at least 4 billion baht through 2026, Suksit Wongwanich, Kasikorn Securities Co. analyst, wrote in a note published July 4. Its EV business. though, still faces challenges with rising competition, he said.\n\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi and Lee Miller.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla's stock (TSLA) closed up about 4% on Tuesday, securing its tenth straight day of gains.\n\nThe positive moves mean Tesla has erased all of its year-to-date losses, with the stock up about 5% since the start of the year. Shares have also surged about 75% since hitting 52-week lows in April.\n\nAnalysts have credited the company's second quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers, which beat Wall Street expectations, along with momentum surrounding Tesla's artificial intelligence businesses.\n\n\"All of a sudden, the market is valuing the growth potential for Tesla,\" Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance. \"Q1 deliveries surprised to the downside so the market was assuming a lower growth rate, and that's why we've seen the large rally.\"\n\nTesla is set to report its next quarterly results on July 23 after the market close. It's teased the development of more affordable electric vehicles, which investors see as another key catalyst for growth.\n\nBut Goldstein said the company will have to lay out a \"solid, concrete timeline\" when it comes to the rollout of those cars, which the company previously said could happen as soon as 2025.\n\n\"We need to see that being met or pushed up earlier so that [Wall Street] can assume Tesla will see a second wave of deliveries growth starting in 2026,\" he said. \"As long as that narrative remains intact, I think that the stock will be OK. But if that's pushed out or if management sounds more uncertain that that's going to happen, then I think we could see the stock falter.\"\n\nOutside of earnings and deliveries, investors will also be on the lookout for another growth opportunity: robotaxis. The company is set to unveil its much-anticipated robotaxi on Aug. 8.\n\nTesla's stock plummeted in the first half of the year after its fourth quarter financial report missed on both the top and bottom lines. A 9% year-over-year drop in first quarter vehicle deliveries sent shares even lower as investors questioned the EV maker's sky-high valuation and demand still left in the US.\n\nSoon after the delivery miss, the company slashed more than 10% of its staff. At the time, analysts categorized the layoffs as an \"ominous signal\" for what's to come.\n\nCompetition abroad from Chinese EV makers including Lucid (LCID), Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO), and XPeng (XPEV) has also served as a significant overhang, fueling a price war that's forced Tesla to aggressively cut prices in order to compete.\n\nStory continues\n\nShort sellers have piled into the name as a result \u2014 but they've now been crushed by its recent rally.\n\n\"Short sellers have been up and down in this name over the past couple years. It was the No. 1 short in the market. Now it's No. 4 behind ... Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" S3 Partners' Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"But this is like the OG short. Everyone is still in it.\" Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk listens to a question as he speaks at the SATELLITE Conference and Exhibition in Washington, March 9, 2020.

        "title": "Early Adopters Pay the Price as EV Truck Values Tumble",
        "content": "Some early adopters of electric vehicle trucks who bought on secondary markets during the EV mania in recent years have been hammered by price collapses.\n\nUsing Bring A Trailer data, we analyzed auctions of four EV trucks: a GMC Hummer EV, a Ford F-150 Lightning EV, a Rivian R1T, and a Tesla Cybertruck. All of these trucks have seen sizeable price declines on the auction website.\n\nLet's start with the GMC Hummer EV, which was heavily hyped and initially sold for a staggering $275k on the auction website in April 2022. Fast forward to today, and used Hummer EVs are now selling on the same site for around $100k, aligning near GMC's listed MSRP.\n\nEven though a Ford F-150 EV has not sold or been listed on Bing A Trailer in about a year, the price collapse from around the $120k mark in the summer of 2022 to about $60k in the summer of 2023 is breathtaking. It's just a devastating price collapse for early adopters who paid a hefty premium on secondary markets. MSRP for Lightnings ranges from $55k to $93k, depending on trim.\n\nIt is more of the same for the Rivian folks who purchased the R1Ts on the secondary market after the initial launch. Prices have plunged by about 50% from the spring of 2022 to the present day. MSRP for Rivian R1T is around $70k.\n\nThe big question is what happens with used Tesla Cybertruck prices. Since March, one auction has been completed at $160k, with one selling last month for about $100k. Tesla does have a penalty for owners selling their trucks in the first year. MSRP for the Foundation Series of the Cybertruck is around $100k.\n\nThe takeaway here is clear: don't buy into the hype.\n\nBy\u00a0 Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nGeorgia's Complex Relationship with NATO Labour Looks to Balance Oil and Gas Revenue With Green Energy Expansion 5 Issues That Will Dominate the NATO Summit\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Can Tesla ETFs Maintain New-Found Winning Momentum?",
        "content": "Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla Inc. TSLA have suffered a lot in recent times due to margin pressure, stiff competition and the overall drag in its business growth. However, luck is turning in Tesla\u2019s favor, with its stock surging 44.7% past month (as of Jul 5, 2024). Shares are now hovering around a six-month high.\n\nDespite this huge jump in stock price, Tesla shares have fallen 6.7% in the past year. TSLA even became one of the worst-performing stocks of the S&P 500 in the initial phase of this year. However, a rebound story seems to be awaiting due to a host of reasons. The recent performance now leads to the question of whether it is time to buy Tesla.\n\nLet\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nTesla Sets New Q2 Delivery Record\n\nIn early July, Tesla announced better-than-expected deliveries for the second quarter of 2024. The numbers point to improved demand that may help ease concerns around excess inventory for its flagship Model 3/Y (read: Tap Tesla's Better-Than-Expected Q2 Deliveries With These ETFs).\n\nThis leading electric carmaker delivered 443,956 (422,405 Model 3/Y and 21,551 other models) cars worldwide in the second quarter of 2024. Though it is down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter, delivery numbers were better than the 436,000 that analysts had expected.\n\nThe annual drop in sales reflects the increased competition in the electric vehicles market. The sales of electric vehicles were at a slower pace, which resulted in investors demanding each car sold be more profitable than before. Tesla produced 410,831 (386,576 Model 3/Y and 24,255 other models) vehicles during the quarter.\n\nTesla\u2019s Foray Into AI Regime\n\nTesla has been reforming itself from a car company to a technology and robotics company, mainly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving technology. Tesla is betting big on driverless software and artificial intelligence in an attempt to revive sales.\n\nIt is slated to introduce \u201crobotaxis\u201d \u2014 a driverless car without a steering wheel or pedals on Aug 8. The next-generation vehicle is widely thought to be key to the electric automaker\u2019s survival, especially as competition heats up in the EV space.\n\nIn late April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company will spend about $10 billion this year on training and inference AI. Tesla's emphasis on AI and autonomous driving is seen as potentially transformative amid the current AI buzz.\n\nTesla Awaiting Improved Profit Margins?\n\nAnalysts like Morningstar Inc.'s Seth Goldstein predict improved profit margins for Tesla, thanks to lower production and raw material costs, as quoted on Bloomberg. He expects the company to \u201creturn to profit growth\u201d next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla is expected to record 35.08% growth next year versus 24.50% expected growth from the Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry and 9.31% growth expected from the S&P 500. Over the next five years, Tesla\u2019s growth rate is expected to be 21.60% versus the underlying industry\u2019s growth rate of 15.40%.\n\nEV Space Gaining Gradual Momentum\n\nElectric car sales remained robust in the first quarter of 2024, having grown by 25% year over year. Since 2021, first-quarter electric car sales have typically made up 15-20% of the total global annual sales, per IEA.\n\nThe major share of the first-quarter sales growth this year came from China. Chinese EV sales are expected to grow by almost 25% in 2024, followed by the United States\u2019 20% growth, according to an IEA report.\n\nNotably, the key growth in relative terms occurred in the first quarter outside the major EV markets, where sales rose by over 50%, indicating a rapid transition to electromobility in countries worldwide.\n\nIEA now forecasts 2024 EV sales to log a year-over-year increase of 20%. And EVs are likely to command more than one-fifth share of total car sales.\n\nAny Wall of Worry?\n\nPolitical shifts, including potential policy changes under Trump administration (if he wins the November election), add uncertainty to the EV market as Trump promotes fossil fuel. And Cybertruck, Tesla\u2019s first new consumer model in years, has been slow to gain momentum.\n\nThe Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Price Return Index reflects a challenging year for EV stocks. EV manufacturers face huge challenges related to funding crisis. Some analysts and fund managers point to the need for industry consolidation and improved profitability before the sector stabilizes, per the Bloomberg article.\n\nBut then, Trump is famous for tariff wars against China. If he wins, he is expected to levy massive tariffs on the Chinese EV players, which should better position Tesla.\n\nWhat Do Technical Indicators Say?\n\nIn fact, Tesla recently saw its 14 Day SMA (Simple Moving Average) going above its 50 Day SMA, suggesting short-term bullishness. The Tesla stock is also seeing a positive reading in its Parabolic SAR, further confirming its short-term bullishness.\n\nBut over the long term, one should be careful as the relative strength index of the Tesla stock is hovering around 80. The value is considered overbought. Overall, it looks like Tesla is a good short-term play but it will take more time to present Tesla as a good long-term bet. Tesla currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Tesla Is Now Biggest-Ever Weighting in ARKK After 80% Stock Gain",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The big rebound in Tesla Inc. shares over the past few months has pushed the electric-vehicle maker to its highest-ever weighting in Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship $6.2 billion exchange-traded fund.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers Biden\u2019s Biggest Donors Left Powerless to Sway Him to End Bid Stocks Hold Near Peak as Powell Sticks to Script: Markets Wrap\n\nTesla now represents 15.4% of the ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) after rallying more than 80% from its 2024 low set in April, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That\u2019s even after the fund trimmed its positions in the Elon Musk-led company in recent weeks.\n\nThe weighting amounts to the strongest conviction in the stock in the 10-year history of the disruptive tech fund, according to an analysis by Strategas Securities. Tesla has long been among Wood\u2019s high-conviction holdings, and reclaimed the top position in ARKK in April to unseat Coinbase Global Inc. The ETF\u2019s second-largest position, Roku Inc., comprises about 9.1% of the fund. Coinbase is third at around 8.5%.\n\n\u201cThe price appreciation aspect is definitely a huge catalyst,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. \u201cUsually they kept a cap of around 10% to 11%, but they are letting it run for now.\u201d\n\nThe ARK Innovation ETF hasn\u2019t bought Tesla shares in recent months, although it did sell a couple of times in July, based on daily updates the firm sends to clients. The ETF has dropped about 12% this year while Tesla has climbed around 5%.\n\nThe carmaker\u2019s shares were on track to rise for a 10th straight session on Tuesday, the longest winning streak since June last year. The rally got a boost this month from quarterly deliveries that beat the average analyst estimate.\n\nArk Investment Management, the parent fund company, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWood has been among Tesla\u2019s ardent supporters, having shot to fame during the height of the pandemic for her bold price calls on the company. Retail traders embraced her views, pushing the company\u2019s assets above $60 billion at their peak in early 2021.\n\nDemand has since dimmed. Ark\u2019s six actively managed ETFs combined now have about $11 billion in assets. As a cohort, the funds have seen a net $3.4 billion outflow this year, led by a $2 billion exodus from ARKK.\n\nStill, Wood\u2019s confidence in Tesla remains steadfast. In June, she updated her forecast for Tesla\u2019s stock to $2,600 by 2029, with a bull case of approximately $3,100. Tesla shares are trading at around $260 on Tuesday in New York.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 10 exchange-traded funds that have Tesla making up 10% or more of their entire portfolio, three are Wood\u2019s. This includes the $1.5 billion ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the $839 million ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ).\n\nOthers include the $1.5 billion Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS) and the $730 million First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund (QCLN).\n\n--With assistance from Vildana Hajric.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era How Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "S&P 500 Hits Record Highs, Eyes 6th Straight Gain As Powell Keeps Bears At Bay; Tesla Targets 10th Consecutive Win, Bank Stocks Rally: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?\n\nThe S&P 500 index climbed to new all-time highs, rising 0.3% during Tuesday\u2019s session, aiming for a potential sixth consecutive positive close and remaining resilient after Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2018s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nPowell used both hawkish tones \u2013 stating that it is not yet appropriate to cut rates until greater confidence on the 2% target is achieved \u2013 and dovish tones, noting recent progress and warning that a weakening labor market could be a significant factor for a rate cut.\n\nMarkets are looking ahead with confidence to the upcoming June inflation report, due this Thursday, which could solidify the already high expectations for a rate cut in September.\n\nFinancials were the top-performing sector on Tuesday, after Reuters reported that the Federal Reserve is considering revising a key rule that could save the nation's\u00a0largest banks billions in capital.\n\nInvestors also anticipate the upcoming banking sector earnings report with three major banks \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) \u2013 set to announce results on Friday.\n\nCommodities were broadly softer, likely impacted by the second consecutive surge of a broader U.S. dollar basket and rising Treasury yields. Natural gas rose again by over 1% following supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) rose 1.8% to $57,800.\n\nElsewhere, French stocks, as tracked by the iShares MSCI France Index Fund (NYSE:EWQ), tumbled 1.6%, reflecting negative investor sentiment after left-wing parties\u2019 election gain.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Dow Jones 39,474.27 0.3% S&P 500 5,590.71 0.3% Nasdaq 100 20,465.04 0.1% Russell 2000 2,040.20 0.0%\n\nUpdated at 1:05 PM ET\n\nAccording to\u00a0Benzinga Pro\u00a0data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.3% higher to $557.01.

        "title": "Tesla Short Sellers Are Getting Burned",
        "content": "One month ago, when momentum-chasing market pundits and other fair-weather experts were quick to throw Tesla out of the Mag7 and forecast that the stock would keep on sinking indefinitely even as the AI bubble took the Big 5 - MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL and META - into the stratosphere, we observed that \"TSLA remains one of the most shorted names in the hedge fund space and is one of the biggest mutual fund underweights\"\n\nThe implication, of course, was that a face-ripping short squeeze was imminent - and sure enough, just three weeks later we have seen the biggest meltup in TSLA history, the stock surging nearly 50% in just over a week.\n\nWe were once again about a month ahead of the curve, and now Bloomberg has caught up, writing that hedge funds had piled into short bets against Tesla right before the electric vehicle maker unveiled a set of numbers that triggered a hefty share-price rally.\n\nBloomberg notes that about 18% of the 500-plus hedge funds tracked by data provider Hazeltree, had a short position on Tesla at the end of June, the highest percentage in more than a year. That compares with just under 15% at the end of March. Of course, anyone who tracked our Twitter feed or had access to our premium subscription, was well aware of this and the imminent squeeze that would soon follow.\n\nThe next part is obvious: having ignored the inevitable meltup, Bloomberg now scrambles to catch up and writes that the massive pile up of short bets \"now threaten to saddle the hedge funds behind them with losses.\" Which is also wrong: the losses have already been booked and most funds were forced to close their shorts in the recent panic meltup. In fact, if anything, now that the squeeze is common knowledge thanks to Bloomberg pointing out what our readers know a month ago, it's time to close the long and go short again, even if the fundamentals suggest that there is more potential upside.\n\nTesla is likely to see its profit margins improve, helped by lower production and raw material costs, according to Morningstar Inc.\u2019s Seth Goldstein, one of the top three analysts covering the stock in a Bloomberg ranking that tracks price recommendations.\n\nThe company will likely \u201creturn to profit growth\u201d next year, he said in a note to clients. But how Tesla handles the market\u2019s intensifying focus on affordable EVs will be key, he added.\n\nNot only that, but with the stock price surging 50% in just a few days, one can make the argument that most if not all good news for the foreseeable future was promptly priced in. Meanwhile, there is a growing sense of uncertainty around how to treat the wider EV market, amid a sea of conflicting dynamics. The industry benefits from generous tax credits. Yet it\u2019s also contending with significant hurdles in the form of tariff wars and even identity politics, with some consumers rejecting EVs as a form of \u201cwoke\u201d transport.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump has said that if he becomes president again after November\u2019s election, he\u2019ll undo existing laws supporting battery-powered vehicles, calling them \u201ccrazy.\u201d That said, Trump is a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, according to Elon Musk, who recently told staff to brace for major job cuts, with sales roles among those affected. And the Cybertruck, Tesla\u2019s first new consumer model in years, has been slow to ramp up.\n\nFor that reason, some hedge fund managers have decided the stock is off bounds altogether. Tesla is \u201cvery difficult for us to position,\u201d said Fabio Pecce, chief investment officer at Ambienta where he oversees $700 million, including managing the Ambienta x Alpha hedge fund.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s not clear whether investors are dealing with \u201ca top company with a great management team\u201d or whether it\u2019s \u201ca challenged franchise with deficient corporate governance,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Trump wins, it is truly going to be very positive\u201d for Tesla, though \u201cobviously not amazing for EVs and renewables in general,\u201d he said. That\u2019s because Trump is expected to impose \u201cmassive tariffs towards the Chinese players,\u201d which would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d to Tesla, Pecce said; this is also wrong since there is virtually no Chinese EV penetration in the US, and if anything it would force even more dumping of Chinese EVs in Europe which is also a huge market for Tesla.\n\nWhile TSLA managedto go green for the year last week after a painful slump which nearly wiped out half the stock value since 2023, other EV companies have fared worse: the Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Price Return Index, whose members include BYD, Tesla and Rivian, is down about 22% so far in 2024. At the same time, the metals and minerals needed to produce batteries are at the mercy of wildly volatile commodities markets, with speculators regularly trying to make a quick buck on shifts in supply and demand. Price volatility means some battery manufacturers are having to adjust to a market in which their profit margins have been getting badly squeezed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, more traditional automakers are finding themselves under pressure from shareholders to slow down their capital expenditure on EVs, with recent examples including Porsche. Polestar Automotive, a high-end EV manufacturer, has lost almost 95% of its value since being spun out of Volvo Car AB two years ago. Fisker, another luxury EV maker, saw its value wiped out starting last year and has since filed for a second Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nSoren Aandahl, founder and CIO of Texas-based Blue Orca Capital, said \u201cvaluations in the EV space are so beat up\u201d that he\u2019s now avoiding shorting the sector. It\u2019s no longer an obvious contrarian bet, because those tend to do best if investors enter \u201cwhen things are a little bit higher,\u201d he said. But at this point, \u201ca lot of the air\u2019s already come out of the balloon\u201d and we certainly agree: the time to go long TSLA was a month ago. Now much of the immediate good news has been priced in.\n\nBut Eirik Hogner, deputy portfolio manager at $2.7 billion hedge fund Clean Energy Transition, suggests there may be more pain to come for the wider EV industry. There are still \u201cway too many\u201d startups that remain \u201csub-scale\u201d and with gross margins that are simply \u201ctoo low,\u201d he said. As a result, the supply-demand dynamic of the EV market \u201cis still very negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, I think you need to see more bankruptcies\u201d before the market starts to look healthier, Hogner said.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nNew Technology Could Revolutionize Solar Power Texas Energy Industry Starts Restoring Operations After Beryl BP Shares Plummet on $2 Billion Impairment Warning\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For many of the global problems today, the solution will arrive via air mobility in the near future.\u00a0Too much traffic?\u00a0Flying cars!\u00a0Overloaded airports and other overworked transportation infrastructure?\u00a0Facilities to handle passengers\u00a0and cargo at alternate sites like heliports.\u00a0Meeting the demands of the burgeoning consumer class\u00a0across the world? Air mobility brings\u00a0in goods and services ranging from healthcare products to flying taxis.\u00a0As always for investors, the challenge is to buy into those urban air mobility stocks that will soar the highest!\n\nThere is a wide range of choices that range from mega-caps to micro-caps.\u00a0Fortunately for investors, there are ways to achieve\u00a0positions across the air mobility\u00a0industry.\u00a0This investment can also result in a single holding that is positioned in many areas of air mobility.\n\nIn addition, there is certain to be consolidation in the air mobile industry.\u00a0That is the nature of the transportation\u00a0sector, especially aviation.\u00a0The more appealing an air mobile stock to an investor today the more attractive the company is to a buyer in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nFor shareholders of Boeing (NYSE: BA), checking out the news lately has been a painful experience. The stock price is down almost 30% for the year.\u00a0But Boeing has taken important steps to recover.\u00a0The first was realizing what needed to be fixed to restore its brand by focusing on the quality of the product.\u00a0Boeing is doing that, which is bullish news.\n\nA major part of that is acquiring Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) in an all-stock deal. A vital supplier to Boeing, it builds the fuselage\u00a0for the Boeing 737 passenger jet, among other crucial components.\u00a0Aerospace consultant\u00a0 Dr. Mike Heil, who headed the Ohio Aerospace Institute, told InvestorPlace\u00a0that, \u201cBoeing made a big mistake when they outsourced aerostructure\u00a0manufacturing to Spirit AeroSystems.\u00a0Engineering, design and manufacturing must be closely linked to produce a superior airplane. By purchasing Spirit, Boeing improves those links and gains direct line authority and control of\u00a0 aerospace manufacturing for their airplanes.\u201d\n\nWall Street approves of the Spirit AeroSystems\u00a0acquisition as Boeing stock is up recently.\u00a0Boeing is active across the air mobility\u00a0industry from flying taxis to rockets for space travel. Management is taking the right steps to bring the company back to the front of urban air mobility stocks so long-term investors should be rewarded.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt times, it seems like things are never easy with an Elon Musk company.\u00a0Based on the trajectory of Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, it should be worth the extra patience for the urban air mobility gains to appear in the stock price as Musk just claimed Tesla will have a flying car by 2025. Who wouldn\u2019t have wanted to have\u00a0invested in the early stages of Tesla when it IPOed for $17 a share in 2010?\n\nUrban air mobility will add more value to Tesla.\u00a0SpaceX, the space company Musk founded, was just valued at $210 billion, making it the most valuable aerospace company. Urban air mobility through a flying car will fill the range of transportation for Musk in a form that no one has\u00a0ever accomplished.\n\nThere is Boring, his tunneling company, for underground travel. Tesla is the most valuable motor vehicle company.\u00a0SpaceX dominates space commerce.\u00a0A flying car will fill out the product line for Musk.\u00a0Based on his recent record pay package, his shareholders more than approve of his vision and execution. Wall Street appreciates it too as it already adds a hefty premium for Tesla. That should increase even more when Tesla becomes viewed among valuable urban air mobility stocks, too.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a major domestic airline, United\u00a0Airlines (NYSE:UAL) offers several ways to invest in air mobility.\u00a0It operates in every inhabited\u00a0continent so there is investment in passenger travel and cargo transportation worldwide.\u00a0United is a major buyer of airplanes so what is good for United is good for Boeing and other aerospace manufacturers.\n\nIt is also at the tip of the flying taxi segment of air mobility. Here, United is partnering up with\u00a0Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR).\u00a0A flying taxi company, Archer announced a deal last year with United to provide service from Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare\u00a0Airport to a downtown heliport in the Medical District of Chicago.\u00a0Archer recently announced plans for a network in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nFor 2024, United stock is up by almost 15%.\u00a0In the last month, it received three analyst upgrades. Its new policy of being more transparent has also been met with approval. There is also high institutional ownership with a low short float.\u00a0That combination indicates that hedge funds, pension groups and other institutional investors are bullish on United.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "BYD Has Its Eyes Set On Conquering Europe",
        "content": "BYD Has Its Eyes Set On Conquering Europe\n\nOn Monday, BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) signed a deal to open a $1 billion electric-vehicle factory in Turkey, directly threatening the dominance of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) in several European markets.\n\nBYD Is Boosting Its Presence In Europe\n\nAlthough BYD has already been selling its EVs in Europe since 2021, most of its sales are still in China, but the Tesla killer is aggressively expanding its footrpint outside its home market. This will be its second facility in Europe, with the first currently undergoing construction in Hungary. Its facility in Turkey will be located in Manisa province, allowing BYD to avoid 40% tariffs in the country. In addition, Turkey has a customs trade deal with the European Union, which hit BYD with provisional tariffs\u00a0for\u00a0imported Chinese electric vehicles last week, adding a 17.4% charge to the existing 10% rate for vehicles that were not manufactured within the EU.\n\nAccording to Investor\u2019s Business Daily, the annual capacity of BYD\u2019s facility in Turkey will be 150,000 EV, and it will also include a research and development division.\n\nBYD Continues To Expand Its Global Footprint\n\nLast Thursday, BYD opened its first EV plant in Southeast Asia or more precisely, in Thailand. Its first facility outside Asia will be in Brazil, as BYD took over old plant of\u00a0Ford Motor(NYSE: F) and started revamping it into an EV facility earlier this year. In June, Bloomberg reported BYD is also finalizing talks for a plant in Mexico, which is expected to create about 10,000 jobs. In this aspect, BYD is following the footsteps of Tesla, taking a leaf from its Gigafactory book.\n\nWhile Tesla reported a second consecutive fall in deliveries, BYD posted record June and second-quarter sales. Tesla did beat estimates as the global sales drop of 4% was lower than what Wall street analysts expected, but BYD\u00a0posted record second quarter sales of\u00a0986,720 EVs,\u00a0which translates to an increase of 57%. In June alone, BYD reported a 35% YoY growth as it sold 341,658 EVs. These robust figures are the result of affordable pricing as BYD led a price war during the first quarter with which it hurt its rivals, Tesla included.\n\nPutting BYD's agressive approach aside, challenges and competitive threats\u00a0remain.\n\nHowever, even BYD has challenges ahead with much smaller rivals and startups intensifying their efforts. One example is Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) that also reproted record June and second quarter sales last week. Last month, Nio revealed its affordable EV brand, Onvo.\u00a0\u00a0Also, Nio will be bringing an affordable EV to Europe next year.\u00a0\u00a0With Nio, along with other startups, planning to launch more affordable EVs in the coming months, the competitive threat is intensifying both for Tesla and BYD, whose margins have been hurt by price wars which they both used to boost demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy With the Best Q2 Delivery Figures",
        "content": "These electric vehicle (EV) stocks picks had some of the best deliveries this quarter.\n\nDue to the current economic downturn, a lot of people aren\u2019t exactly lining up to snag the latest EV model. As such, EV makers have resorted to slashing prices to deal with declining demand. That has triggered a price war while straining the profitability margins for companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the E.U. has imposed tariffs on Chinese EV exports to fend off competition from Chinese manufacturers, which the rest of the industry believes has an unfair advantage of being heavily state-subsidized.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThose are just some of the highlights of the current state of play for the EV industry.\n\nIn short, the EV market is ultra-competitive right now. Only the companies that innovate the best and sell the most will thrive. And if you\u2019re looking to bet on EV stock, those are the companies to watch.\n\nHere are the EV stocks with the best Q2 deliveries, which look pretty promising.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese company Nio (NYSE:NIO) had one of the strongest deliveries this quarter. The Shanghai-headquartered company delivered a total of 21,209 vehicles in June. That was a record 98% surge compared to the same month in 2023. This total included 11,581 premium smart electric SUVs and 9,628 premium smart electric sedans.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, NIO delivered 57,373 vehicles, which marked another year-on-year growth of 143.9%. It built this growth on its first quarter delivery. During the time, it marked a 134.6% increase in April compared to the year prior. Shares of the company notched around 10% in July on the news.\n\nThis strong performance illustrates Nio\u2019s aggressive inroads into both the domestic and international EV market and why it\u2019s been described as the ultimate threat to auto companies in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nShareholders are waiting to see if second-quarter results will be anything like its deliveries. In the meantime, it\u2019s clear Nio is on a winning streak.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 this quarter, topping analysts\u2019 expectations. With 13,790 vehicles delivered, the company is up 9% from a year ago.\n\nAnd though production dipped from the same period last year, when the company delivered 13,992 vehicles, deliveries jumped from the previous year\u2019s 12,640 vehicles.\n\nThe California-based firm reaffirmed its annual production goal of 57,000 vehicles for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian shares rose by 7%, closing July 2\u2019s session at $14.89 \u2014 its highest level since mid-Feb. The company\u2019s stock has received a drubbing this year amid wider industry challenges. But it\u2019s also thanks to being overshadowed by bigger industry names such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nRivian investors will get a clearer picture of the company\u2019s performance when Q2 financial results come out on August 6. Until then, this good news should keep them happy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile other auto manufacturers companies are slowing down EV production this year due to low demand, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is staying on track with its production schedule of over 200,000 EVs this year.\n\nThis month, the company reported 21,930 deliveries of EVs in the second quarter \u2014 a 34% increase over the first quarter and a 40% from 2023. That can be attributed to the strong performance of its electric Hummer, which added a 76% increase in sales over the previous quarter. In addition, the Cadillac LYRIQ, an electric SUV, also performed well, with sales rising by 26% from the first to the second quarter.\n\nGeneral Motors also saw retail EV registrations rise 17% year-to-date \u2014 significantly outpacing the retail industry\u2019s 10% gain.\n\nTo offer consumers more choices and strengthen its inroads into the niche, the company plans to roll out 10 EV nameplates. With these developments, General Motors\u2019 stock price could shoot further. Shares are up 30% this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "3 Toxic Stocks to Sell Before They Plunge to New Lows",
        "content": "Investing in individual stocks is not for the faint of heart, and can result in substantial losses for prospective investors. As Q3 2024 kicks off, now is a great time to consider the top toxic stocks to sell.\n\nWhile some stocks promise sustainable returns, others pose significant risks that can erode your investment capital. The stocks, despite their potential for recovery, are more likely to drag your portfolio down and do more harm than good. This is due to a combination of factors, including poor financial health, unfavorable market conditions, and limited long-term growth prospects.\n\nIt can often be difficult to identify these factors, and investors often find out too late. Additionally, dead cat bounces can often trick investors into believing that the fundamentals of the company have changed. Therefore, the ability to cut your losses is extremely important to safeguard your portfolio from further implosion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the top 3 toxic stocks to sell before they plunge even further from current levels!\n\nLuminar Technologies (LAZR) Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around it\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com\n\nLuminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) emerged as a beacon of hope in the autonomous vehicle sector. However, many high-flying, unprofitable EV startups were crushed by inflation and higher interest rates over the last 24 months. Luminar is a prime example and recent developments have painted a much grimmer picture.\n\nLuminar is a prominent player in the lidar sensor market for autonomous vehicles. Despite initial hype and promising partnerships from companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the company\u2019s stock has been on a downward trajectory. This is no surprise with the softened demand for EVs in the last year. Moreover, the company\u2019s financial performance is concerning, raising further questions about its liquidity. Luminar cut 20% of its workforce in May to preserve cash as the slow adoption rate hurts its ability to become profitable.\n\nAdditionally, the market it operates in is not only slowing down, but it is highly competitive. It faces steep competition from established lidar manufacturers with deep pockets like Ouster (NASDAQ:OUST). With mounting losses and a dwindling cash reserve, LAZR is one of the top toxic stocks to sell in 2024.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront. Peloton layoffs\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) was a darling during the pandemic era, with its high-end exercise equipment during stay-at-home orders. However, the post-pandemic reality has been harsh for Peloton, leading to a drastic fall from grace.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeloton skyrocketed during the pandemic-induced lockdowns and has since plummeted as gyms and the global economy re-opened. Its business model, which relies heavily on subscription-based fees, is facing significant headwinds. As more affordable alternatives emerged, Peloton\u2019s subscriber growth has slowed down considerably. Moreover, its operating losses are growing and its path to profitability will be an uphill battle. In Q3 FY24, revenue decreased 4% year over year to $718 million. Loss from operations was $167.3 million, with paid fitness subscriptions up zero percent from the year prior.\n\nThe once optimistic projections of sustained growth have been replaced by a more sobering reality of shrinking revenue and losses. Additionally, its recent attempts to cut costs and restructure operations might not pay off. Given these challenges, PTON stock is a poster child for toxic stocks to sell before its value erodes further.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO ES6 electric SUV semi-autonomous car on display near Chinese automobile manufacturer NIO software development office in Silicon Valley. Chinese EV companies like NIO are in the news.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO), often touted as the \u201cTesla of China\u201d, was once a prominent player in the electric vehicle (EV) market. However, despite its early promise and initial success, the company\u2019s limited long-term growth prospects make the stock a strong sell in 2024.\n\nNio faces numerous challenges, including intense competition from both domestic and international rivals. The company\u2019s global ambitions are extremely delusional, especially considering its tiny market share of less than 2% in China. Companies like Tesla and BYD are eating its lunch, and the gap continues to grow even wider. Demand for EVs has softened tremendously in the last 12 months, and small companies like Nio are still battling with operational challenges.\n\nIts risky business model, including battery-swapping technology, is not ideal. This technology is extremely expensive and will likely never see global adoption. Furthermore, the company\u2019s mounting losses raise questions about its ability to become GAAP profitable. In the first quarter of 2024, its vehicle deliveries also saw year-over-year and sequential declines. With losses set to continue, investors might have better odds at the roulette table.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock might be rallying, but electric vehicle maker still looks like a bad long-term investment idea. A fuse has been lit underneath Tesla stock. Since July 1, the company\u2019s share price has risen 27%, erasing its previous losses on the year.\n\nTrading above $250 per share, TSLA stock appears to have momentum behind it right now and could move higher in the short-term.\n\nHowever, despite the current rally, Tesla stock remains down 10% over the last 12 months and is nearly 40% below its all-time high reached in November 2021 when the pandemic rally peaked.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the ongoing problems at Tesla, it is unlikely that the current rally in its shares is sustainable or likely to propel the stock to new heights.\n\nNot as Bad as Feared\n\nThe catalyst for the current run higher in Tesla stock has been the company\u2019s second quarter delivery numbers, which serve as an approximation for sales.\n\nInvestors are bidding up Tesla stock because the Q2 delivery numbers beat Wall Street forecasts. However, analysts had set a very low bar for Tesla given its recent poor financial results.\n\nMake no mistake, the latest delivery numbers from the automaker were still bad. They just weren\u2019t as bad as feared.\n\nTesla\u2019s latest deliveries totaled 443,956 vehicles in the second quarter, with total production of 410,831 vehicles. Analysts on Wall Street had expected deliveries of 439,000, according to data from FactSet.\n\nDespite beating analyst forecasts, Tesla\u2019s Q2 deliveries were down 4.8% from 466,140 vehicles a year earlier and demonstrated a continued sales decline at the company.\n\nIn comparison, rival automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) reported its best quarterly sales in nearly four years for the second quarter, boosted by a 40% increase in sales of its electric vehicles.\n\nMake-or-Break Quarter\n\nTesla is scheduled to announce its second-quarter financial results on July 23. The print is shaping up to be a make-or-break moment for the company and its stock.\n\nThe previous quarterly results from the company were a complete train wreck and the main reason that Tesla had, until now, been among the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index this year.\n\nFor the first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 and management warned that its \u201cvolume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\u201d\n\nWhile the company has announced a host of new initiatives in recent months, ranging from robots to supercomputers, none of the plans seem to have firm timelines or are guaranteed to help the company\u2019s top and bottom lines. They also distract Tesla from its core business of making electric vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSell Tesla Stock\n\nAdd in the recent drama surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s exorbitant and unjustified $56 billion pay package and there\u2019s no good reason to take a position in TSLA stock.\n\nThe company\u2019s electric vehicle sales continue to decline while competitors such as General Motors surpass them. The upcoming quarter could be an ugly one that ends the recent rally in the company\u2019s shares.\n\nPlans to shift into new ventures look like moon shots at best. For all of these reasons, Tesla stock is not a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Almost all investors have mistakenly held onto a stock, hoping it\u2019ll bounce back, only to watch it plummet further. Regardless, they still often bounce back in the long run if you go after profitable companies. It doesn\u2019t matter what valuation you buy profitable and quality businesses, as they will reward you in the long run.\n\nHowever, not all stocks have the same underlying business. Some stocks are perpetually diluting their shareholders and do not have any profits. Instead, these businesses are likely to keep bleeding cash until they file for bankruptcy. They\u2019ll look cheap on the surface, but you should steer as far as possible from these stocks. If not, you\u2019ll likely enter a cycle of reverse stock splits and dilution.\n\nHere are seven stocks to sell to avoid that pitfall:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of a futuristic-looking silver airplane.\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) operates commercial spacecraft designed to fly private astronauts and researchers to space. The company\u2019s inability to turn a profit and history of overpromising and underdelivering have me seriously concerned about its long-term viability.\n\nManagement touted increasing the flight frequency of their mothership, VMS Eve, to support three space missions per week. They project this could generate $450 million in annualized revenue with their first two Delta spaceships. However, I struggle to see the market demand to fill 770 seats per year at $600,000 or more a ticket. Space tourism remains a very niche market with a limited pool of ultra-wealthy clientele.\n\nMeanwhile, deep-pocketed competitors like Blue Origin and SpaceX are rapidly advancing their own space tourism capabilities. This rivalry threatens to siphon away Virgin Galactic\u2019s already small addressable market. The company also continues battling regulator scrutiny and technical delays that have decimated investor confidence. The stock is down 83% year-to-date.\n\nVirgin Galactic feels like a company far too ahead of its time. It is burning cash on an exceedingly expensive business model with dubious consumer demand. I don\u2019t think it can reach profitability before the coffers run dry.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is a plant-based meat substitute company that has been struggling to find its footing in an increasingly competitive market. In my opinion, the company\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings paint a bleak picture for the future of Beyond Meat.\n\nDespite reporting revenue of $75.6 million, which narrowly beat expectations, the company\u2019s gross margin of 4.9% is a far cry from the 6.7% it reported in Q1 2023. This decline in profitability is particularly concerning given the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to bring production in-house and consolidate its network. I\u2019m not sure how a company can turn profitable with margins like this.\n\nStory continues Stocks to sell before bankruptcy: BYND margins\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s operating expenses at $57.1 million includes a $7.5 million accrual for consumer class action settlements. While the company has managed to reduce its operating expenses by $6.8 million year-over-year, it\u2019s clear that Beyond Meat is still struggling to control costs.\n\nAs a result, Beyond Meat reported a staggering loss from operations of $53.5 million in Q1 2024, only a slight improvement from the $57.7 million loss it reported in the same period last year. This ongoing bleeding of cash is unsustainable.\n\niHeartMedia (IHRT) A close-up of the iHeart Radio (IHRT) logo out front of a brick office building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\niHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT) is a media and entertainment company. If trends don\u2019t improve dramatically, it could be headed for bankruptcy.\n\niHeart missed revenue guidance, posting a concerning 1.5% decline to $799 million in Q1. Profitability remains elusive, with analysts projecting another year of losses.\n\nNone of this is instilling any confidence on Wall Street. Guggenheim slashed their price target by 40%, and the stock has plummeted 74% over the past year to trade near all-time lows. The technicals scream oversold, too, but in this case, I think it\u2019s deserved pessimism rather than an attractive discount. iHeart\u2019s core radio broadcasting model is in secular decline as advertising dollars shift to streaming, so I\u2019m not very hopeful about a rebound here.\n\nExela Technologies (XELA) Business robotic process automation and technology concept with gears system or workflow and consultant team working on computer in office in background, automated ERP management, CRM or financial. BPA, XELA stock\n\nSource: NicoElNino / Shutterstock.com\n\nExela Technologies (NASDAQ:XELA) provides business process automation solutions. In Q1 2024, Exela\u2019s revenue declined by 5.4% YOY to $258.8 million. The core Information and Transaction Processing Solutions segment was hit particularly hard, with revenue plunging 9% due to the loss of a substantial $27 million contract.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more alarming is that Exela is struggling to turn a profit despite operating in the high-growth, high-margin business process automation space. The company reported a net loss of $25.6 million for the quarter. Liquidity also appears to be a major issue, with unrestricted cash dwindling to a mere $10 million after making an interest payment. Management even admitted they are scrambling to \u201cexpand liquidity\u201d as rising taxes erode their dwindling net operating losses.\n\nThe fact that Exela is flailing in such a lucrative industry is a giant red flag. With the stock already down 51% over the past year, I believe this downward spiral is far from over.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) has an extensive EV charging network. Revenue declined 17.7% YOY to a paltry $107 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? The company blamed deal delays on construction setbacks, but I suspect there are deeper issues at play. ChargePoint\u2019s inventory spiked 13% as they grapple with sluggish demand in a fiercely competitive market. Rivals are chomping at the bit, and even the company admits Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) opening its Supercharger network is a looming threat.\n\nCash burn remains alarming, and profitability is a distant dream. The CEO also jumped ship. Some argue ChargePoint expanded too quickly to dominate this space. I\u2019d agree with that since margins are not going to turn positive unless the company sacrifices its top line.\n\nI\u2019m steering clear of this stock, especially as dilution is accelerating. CHPT dilution chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith shares down almost 80% in the past year alone, I see no compelling reason to bottom-fish here.\n\nRedfin Corporation (RDFN) Redfin sign posted in front of a house for sale; Redfin (RDFN) is a real estate brokerage whose business model is based on sellers paying Redfin a small fee\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRedfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) is a real estate brokerage company that operates an online real estate marketplace. Despite their best efforts, I believe Redfin is facing an uphill battle that could push them towards financial ruin. In the first quarter of 2024, the company reported a substantial adjusted EBITDA loss of $28 million. While this was slightly better than their guidance, it\u2019s still a concerning sign of their ongoing struggles.\n\nWhat\u2019s more troubling is that this loss comes after Redfin has already implemented significant cost-cutting measures. They\u2019ve restructured their brokerage in an attempt to gain market share, but even with a slight uptick to 0.77% in Q1 2024, it\u2019s unclear if this will be enough to right the ship. The harsh reality is that rising mortgage rates are putting immense pressure on Redfin\u2019s business model.\n\nIn my view, their goal of achieving a full-year adjusted EBITDA profit seems increasingly out of reach. The housing market is on shaky ground, and Redfin\u2019s previous $23 million net loss in Q4 2023 doesn\u2019t inspire confidence. While the company is touting the growth potential of its rental marketplace and lending business, I fear these initiatives will be too little, too late.\n\nTerran Orbital (LLAP) A photo of a satellite over earth.\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nTerran Orbital (NYSE:LLAP) manufactures small satellites for commercial and government customers. The company has faced significant challenges recently, and I believe its stock is a strong sell candidate before its situation potentially deteriorates further.\n\nIn Q1, they finally held an earnings call after not doing so in Q4. Terran Orbital\u2019s revenue declined 3.4% YOY to just $27.2 million, substantially missing analyst estimates by over $14 million. The company\u2019s net loss of 27 cents per share was also much worse than the consensus forecast.\n\nMoreover, there has been slow progress on Terran\u2019s $2.4 billion Rivada Space Networks contract.\n\nRich Smith from The Motley Foolcalled it \u201ca tale of two stocks.\u201d He also pointed out that \u201c\u2026 Rivada is an alleged space company that no one seems to have heard of, and that according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, may have annual revenues of less than $5 million\u2026 but is somehow promising to pay Terran Orbital $2.4 billion to build it 300 satellites.\u201d\n\nAny delays or issues with this Rivada project could be devastating. This is the only thing keeping bulls optimistic right now.\n\nTerran Orbital\u2019s cash burn remains elevated, and I question whether its modest workforce expansion and automation investments will be enough to significantly improve efficiency. With just under 50 satellites slated for delivery in 2024, production will need to ramp up dramatically to meet targets.\n\nFurthermore, Lockheed recently abandoned its acquisition offer amid Terran\u2019s ongoing strategic review.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 9, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Tesla TSLA and Palantir PLTR.\n\nQ2 Earnings Season to Kick Off as These Leaders Surge\n\nThey say to never short a dull market.\n\nThe stock market has been eerily calm over the past few weeks as we head into the thick of the summer season. The month of June was the quietest month for stocks in nearly five years, with the S&P 500 failing to drop even half a percent on a (daily) closing basis.\n\nIn fact, we haven\u2019t had a 1% decline (or greater) in the S&P 500 since April 30th.\n\nAs we know, things don\u2019t normally stay that peaceful in the market for long. Complacency has begun to set in as the second-quarter earnings season kicks off. The Q2 reporting slate will get underway this week with several of the megabanks highlighting the schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s another busy week ahead with more inflation data due out to supplement the earnings results. The June CPI inflation report will be released on Thursday morning, followed by the PPI data on Friday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also testify before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s jobs report, market participants are now pricing in a roughly 77% chance of a rate cut at the September meeting. The FOMC is widely expected to hold firm later this month.\n\nStocks have enjoyed a stellar run in 2024, expanding on last year\u2019s start to this new bull market. Tech stocks continue to lead the way, with the Nasdaq advancing more than 22% through the end of last week. The S&P 500 earned a very respectable 16.7% over the same time frame.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stock Performance\n\nDespite the seemingly strong start to the year, individual stock performance has been a mixed bag to say the least. The major indexes have masked some underlying weakness, with breadth measures retreating over the past several months. Just 46% of stocks on the NYSE are trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, well below the 86% we saw at the start of the year.\n\nDepending on how we look at it, this can either be bullish or bearish. We don\u2019t really like to see the major indexes hitting all-time highs with low participation, as it highlights the fact that only a small percentage of stocks are propping them up. On the other hand, weak breadth leaves room for improvement going forward as oversold pockets of the market have the potential to come back to life.\n\nThe weak breadth hasn\u2019t stopped market leaders from outperforming. Just last week, five of the Magnificent 7 members touched new all-time highs \u2013 and that didn\u2019t include Nvidia! It appears that the growth story for these companies is still very much in play.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe one outlier in terms of Magnificent 7 performance throughout this bull market has undoubtedly been Tesla. The stock was down more than 40% on the year by late April, but TSLA shares have come roaring back after stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries along with upbeat sentiment surrounding the company\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and AI ambitions.\n\nNotably, Tesla went from a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) over the same time frame, reflecting the bullish change in earnings estimate revisions. Tesla is now positive on the year after the latest rip-roaring rally sent the stock 44% higher over the past month, regaining key technical levels in the process.\n\nIntelligence Stock Stages Breakout Ahead of Q2 Results\n\nOutside of the Magnificent 7 stocks, intelligence software provider Palantir broke out last week to a fresh 52-week closing high. The company builds and deploys platforms to assist in counterterrorism operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and internationally.\n\nPalantir has surpassed the earnings mark in each of the past six quarters. Analysts are expecting the Denver-based company to report second-quarter earnings in early August of $0.08/share, which would mark a 60% improvement relative to the year-ago period. Palantir has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.17%.\n\nPLTR shares have been volatile but are widely outperforming the market this year. The stock appears to be completing a cup-with-handle breakout pattern on above-average volume.\n\nMake sure to keep an eye on this intelligence leader as well as the continued success of the Magnificent 7 group as we officially kick off the Q2 earnings season.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Most top CEOs aren't giving to either Trump or Biden",
        "content": "CEOs are largely keeping their money away from presidential politics in 2024.\n\nThe heads of 98 of America's 100 biggest companies have chosen not to financially support either of the major party's standard-bearers so far, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis of the latest federal campaign finance filings tracking donations through early June.\n\nThese top bosses have personally given only about $88,000 to presidential candidates, and most of that money went to Donald Trump's primary rivals who are no longer in the race.\n\nNot a single one of these executives has given a disclosed donation to Trump \u2014 confirming a similar recent analysis by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\n\nBut the data also shows a paltry level of support for Joe Biden as well, with just two major CEOs giving to the president, according to the latest data, which runs through the beginning of June.\n\nThose executives are Sarah London of healthcare company Centene (CNC) and Timothy Sweeney of Liberty Mutual Insurance Group. Representatives from Centene and Liberty Mutual didn't respond to requests for comment from Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut these executives aren't avoiding national politics altogether. By a whopping 19 to 1 margin, they are instead putting their dollars behind an array of candidates for Congress.\n\nThe analysis is based on campaign finance filings of the CEOs of America's 100 largest companies by revenue as measured by Fortune. These bosses collectively manage more than 16 million employees and run companies worth nearly $26 trillion.\n\nA decline in CEO engagement in presidential politics\n\nThe trend so far in this election cycle appears to be a continuation of a decline in top CEO engagement in the presidential elections, a trend that has coincided with Donald Trump's appearance on the political scene.\n\nWay back in 2012, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, a whopping 27 Fortune 100 CEOs gave to Republican nominee Mitt Romney while five gave to then-President Barack Obama.\n\nBy 2020, that figure had dropped to just six CEOs willing to give. Four gave to Biden, with two sending checks to Trump.\n\nThis time around, both Trump and Biden do have their business world backers. Figures like Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman and venture capitalist David Sacks are prominently supporting Trump. Meanwhile, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is a prominent supporter of Biden.\n\nBut those charged with overseeing the largest companies in the world appear to be staying away, at least financially.\n\nA slim majority of this group \u2014 51 out of the 100 analyzed by Yahoo Finance \u2014 are avoiding any personal entanglement with the 2024 race.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey, so far at least, have not made a single penny in disclosed donations to any candidate for president, any congressional race, or any group promoting a specific political issue.\n\nThat group includes some of the biggest names in corporate America, from the CEOs of Apple (AAPL) and Walmart (WMT) to Citigroup (C) and Walt Disney (DIS).\n\nWell-connected Americans of course have a wide variety of ways to engage in the 2024 race that won't show up in government campaign finance data.\n\nCEOs can give to \"dark money\" groups that aren't required to disclose their donors. These CEOs also often give to their company's in-house political action committees, which can then turn around and give money to candidates (although data shows those company committees are less inclined to donate this time around as well.)\n\nCEOs also have the ability to be intricately involved in the political conversation without opening their wallets. Perhaps no top CEO has been as closely involved in the race as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who constantly weighs in with posts critical of Biden while he reportedly speaks to Trump several times a month.\n\n\"I am not donating money to either candidate for US President,\" Musk said in a recent post. The data shows he has gone further than that. Musk, at least through this spring, appears not to have given a dime to any 2024 federal political candidate.\n\nWhere the CEO money is going\n\nThe middling support for the top of the 2024 ticket contrasts with about $1.7 million headed into the coffers of congressional candidates from these executives so far, according to the analysis.\n\nThe money that these CEOs are giving is highly focused in the race for Congress, where control of both chambers is up in the air and a wide array of industry issues can be impacted by lawmaker actions.\n\nResearch in 2022 from Harvard Business School found approximately 70% of top executives at S&P 500 companies identify as Republicans. As such, the donations so far this election season tend to skew Republican but are far from universal.\n\nModerate Democrats show up often. Sen. Jon Tester is locked in a tight reelection campaign in Montana and is a frequent recipient.\n\nLikewise for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic party to become an independent and then ultimately decided not to seek reelection in 2024 after a short campaign. President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump during a Presidential Debate at CNN Studios in Atlanta on June 27. (Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nPowerful lawmakers with a direct say over industry concerns also often received donations, whether or not they face contested races.\n\nDemocratic Senator Maria Cantwell received donations from numerous executives, even as she is expected to cruise to reelection in Washington state. Cantwell is the chair of the Senate's influential Commerce Committee.\n\nLikewise for Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. She shows up on numerous executive donation lists as she runs in what is widely expected to be a safe seat for Republicans.\n\nThe CEOs also gave over $350,000 to a variety of issue-specific groups mostly related to the sector where they do business.\n\nOil executives often gave to the American Petroleum Institute, which represents their interests in Washington, as just one example.\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott, and Chris Christie also received support from four members of this elite group before Trump defeated them in the primary season.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla Stock\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Comeback: What the Latest Q2 Data Means for Investors",
        "content": "Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) journey in 2024 has been anything but smooth. We\u2019ve got factory shutdowns, shipping woes, and some serious competition nipping at Tesla\u2019s heels, especially in China. Yet, Elon Musk\u2019s unwavering commitment to expanding Tesla\u2019s EV lineup has kept the company on track. The recent release of Tesla\u2019s Q2 production and delivery report has everyone talking. While the numbers show a decline compared to last year, they still managed to beat analysts\u2019 expectations, giving the stock a much-needed boost.\n\nPersonally, I am bullish on Tesla stock. While the company faces significant challenges, its ability to beat delivery expectations in a tough environment, coupled with its strong brand and leadership in EV technology, suggests potential for continued growth.\n\nQ2 Delivery and Production Highlights\n\nTesla managed to produce around 411,000 vehicles in the second quarter, which is impressive considering the challenges the firm has faced recently. Tesla delivered more cars than it produced, with approximately 444,000 vehicles going to customers\u2019 driveways. This marks a 4.8% year-over-year decline in deliveries and a 14% drop in production compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nAs expected, the Model 3 and Model Y were the stars of the show, accounting for the lion\u2019s share of production at 386,576 units and deliveries at 422,405 units. The Model S, Model X, and the much-hyped Cybertruck made up the rest, with 24,255 units produced and 21,551 units delivered.\n\nAnalysts had expected Tesla to deliver around 439,302 vehicles, so the company\u2019s performance was a welcome surprise. This news sent Tesla\u2019s stock soaring 10% to $231.26 despite being down about 7% for the year.\n\nIn just three trading days, from July 1st to July 3rd, Tesla\u2019s stock surged by a jaw-dropping 23%. That\u2019s right, nearly a quarter of the company\u2019s value was added in just 72 hours, and the stock has gone up a bit more in the past few days.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive is that this surge has completely erased Tesla\u2019s year-to-date losses. The stock is now up 1.8% for the year, a far cry from where it was just two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that even with this recent dip, Tesla is still trading at a significant premium compared to other automakers. Its P/E ratio of 64.3x is miles above the likes of General Motors (NYSE:GM) (5.7x) and Ford (NYSE:F) (13.3x), indicating that a lot of growth is already baked into the stock price. The coming quarters will be crucial in determining whether Tesla can maintain this momentum and justify its lofty valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s Challenges and Strategic Responses\n\nTesla is feeling the heat from competition, especially in China. BYD (OTC:BYDDF), their biggest rival, sold around 426,000 pure electric vehicles in Q2, which is just shy of Tesla\u2019s 443,956 deliveries\u2014a gap of only 17,956 units. And it\u2019s not just BYD; other Chinese automakers like Geely (OTC:GELYF) are also stepping up their game, with Geely\u2019s sales jumping 41% in the first half of 2024.\n\nIn response, Tesla has been aggressively cutting prices since early 2023, which has helped maintain sales volume but also squeezed profit margins. Its Automotive gross margin dropped to 18.5% in Q1 2024 from 21.1% in Q1 2023. Tesla also faced significant challenges earlier this year, including an arson attack at their German factory and shipping disruptions due to the Red Sea riot, contributing to a 14% year-over-year decline in Q2 production.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Tesla isn\u2019t just playing defense. Elon Musk has plans to accelerate the mass production of affordable EVs, potentially launching in the first half of 2025. This could be a game-changer for reaching a broader market. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s energy storage business is thriving, with Q1 revenue hitting a record $1.64 billion and energy deployments reaching 4.1 GWh.\n\nTesla is also heavily investing in AI and robotics, nearly doubling their AI training capacity. Musk is so confident in their Optimus humanoid robots that he thinks they could boost Tesla\u2019s market value to $25 trillion (its market cap is currently around $800 billion).\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Tesla and Its Investors?\n\nA few key events are coming up that could significantly impact Tesla\u2019s future. First, the Q2 earnings report on July 23rd will give us a detailed look at their financial performance. Analysts expect revenue to reach $23.83 billion. They also predict earnings per share (EPS) of $0.60, with a range of $0.41 to $0.87. This represents a significant improvement from the previous quarter\u2019s EPS of $0.45. If Tesla\u2019s revenue growth turns positive in Q3, it would mark a major recovery milestone.\n\nThen there\u2019s Robotaxi Day on August 8th, which could be a big deal for Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving ambitions. Nonetheless, analysts have mixed views on Tesla\u2019s stock. Dan Ives from Wedbush is optimistic, raising his price target to $300, believing the worst is behind Tesla and that upcoming innovations like the Robotaxi could drive growth.\n\nOn the other hand, Colin Langan from Wells Fargo is cautious, recommending selling Tesla shares due to concerns about declining delivery growth and the impact of price cuts on margins. His price target is a conservative $120. Guggenheim analysts also raised their price target to $134 but maintained a Sell rating, noting Tesla\u2019s impressive energy storage deployments as a key factor.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAccording to the latest analyst ratings, Tesla stock has a consensus Hold rating. Out of 35 analysts covering the stock, 13 rate it a Buy, 14 a Hold, and eight a Sell. The average TSLA stock price target of $184.41 implies downside potential of around 27.1% from the current price.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, Tesla\u2019s Q2 delivery report was a mixed bag. While the company beat estimates, deliveries still dropped year-over-year. The market reacted positively, but analysts are divided on the stock\u2019s future. Some believe the worst is over for the company, while others remain cautious about the competitive pressures and potential margin squeezes.\n\nDespite these challenges, I\u2019m bullish on Tesla stock. The company\u2019s resilience, commitment to expanding its EV lineup, and exciting potential in AI and energy storage make it a compelling investment. The upcoming Q2 earnings report on July 23 and Robotaxi Day on August 8 could provide more clarity and potentially drive the stock higher. As always, do your homework and invest wisely.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Judge who nixed Musk's pay package hears arguments on massive fee request from plaintiff lawyers",
        "content": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) \u2014 A Delaware judge heard arguments Monday over a massive and unprecedented fee request by lawyers who successfully argued that a massive and unprecedented pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk was illegal and should be voided.\n\nAttorneys for a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package are asking Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick to award them legal fees in the form of stock in the electric vehicle company valued at more than $7 billion at current trading prices. The 2018 compensation package for Musk that was rescinded by the judge was potentially worth more than $55 billion.\n\nAfter a full day of expert-witness testimony and arguments by attorneys, McCormick gave no indication on when she would rule on the fee request.\n\nThe fee amount sought by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys dwarfs the current record $688 million in legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron.\n\nAttorneys for the Tesla shareholder argue that their work resulted in the \u201cmassive\u201d benefit of returning shares to Tesla that otherwise would have gone to Musk and diluted the stock held by other Tesla investors. They value that benefit at $51.4 billion, using the difference between the stock price at the time of McCormick\u2019s January ruling and the strike price of some 304 million stock options granted to Musk.\n\nAttorney Greg Varallo told McCormick that he and his fellow plaintiff lawyers were simply asking for \u201ca slice of the value pie we created.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did battle with the very best,\u201d Varallo added. \u201cLitigation against Tesla is never easy. There are companies who play by the rules every day, and then there are companies like Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff attorneys argue that their fee request is \u201cconservative\u201d under Delaware law. Instead of a typical 33% fee recovery, they note that they are seeking only 11% of the shares now available to Tesla as the result of Musk\u2019s options being rescinded by McCormick\u2019s ruling.  The judge agreed with the shareholder lawyers\u2019 argument that Musk engineered the landmark 2018 pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.\n\nFollowing the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time. McCormick made clear, however, that the June vote would not be considered in determining the request for attorney fees. It instead will be the subject of a separate hearing in early August.\n\nMeanwhile, some opponents of the fee request argue that the plaintiff attorneys deserve no fee at all because they did not bestow any economic benefit on Tesla and instead may have even harmed the company. Opponents contend that the purported reversal of share dilution among Tesla stockholders is not a benefit to the Austin, Texas-based company itself and cannot be used to justify the fee request. They also note that the fee request fails to quantify or subtract potential negative consequences of the ruling, including the need to find a new way to compensate Musk for six years of non-salaried service to Tesla since 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe market did not react like this rescission remedy bestowed any benefit,\u201d defense attorney John Reed told McCormick, noting that Tesla\u2019s market capitalization dropped by $15 billion after her ruling.\n\nSome critics argue that any fee award should be based only on the number of hours the plaintiff attorneys worked, and a reasonable hourly rate. Adding a multiplier to incentivize attorneys who work on a contingency basis in corporate disputes might also be appropriate, they have suggested. That approach could still result in a fee award of tens of millions of dollars. The current fee request equates to an hourly rate of about $288,000 for plaintiff attorneys and would result in an \u201cunwholesome windfall,\u201d according to opponents.\n\nAcknowledging the criticism that the fee request has received, plaintiff attorneys in a recent court filing proposed an alternative fee structure. Under that scenario, they would be willing to accept $1.44 billion in cash, equating to an hourly fee of about $74,000.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla shareholders are set to appear in a Delaware court on Monday to call for the judge to reject the \"outlandish\" request for $7 billion in attorneys' fees to be paid by the company to the legal team that led the challenge to CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.\n\nThe record fee request was made by investor Richard Tornetta on behalf of the three law firms that represented him in the lawsuit against Musk's compensation plan, which is believed to be the largest among CEOs of publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nTornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over the pay package that was originally approved by shareholders in 2018 before it was voided by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery this January. Last month, Tesla shareholders voted to reinstate the compensation plan, though it remains paused pending the resolution of the case.\n\nThe fee request amounts to roughly $7.2 billion based on Tesla's stock price on Friday and amounts to a rate of $370,000 for every hour worked by the team of 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals \u2014 some of whom typically bill as little as $275 an hour, according to documents submitted by Tornetta's legal team to the court.\n\nMUSK WON PAY PACKAGE WITH SHAREHOLDERS' VOTE, TESLA ARGUES IN COURT FILING Tesla shareholders are arguing that the request for $7 billion in legal fees is excessive.\n\n\"The legal fees appear exceedingly disproportionate and outlandish,\" Nathan Chiu, a Tesla shareholder from New Jersey, wrote to Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery in March, according to a court filing.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nChiu, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and more than 8,000 Tesla shareholders have sent the Delaware court 1,500 letters and objections related to the requested legal fee, according to court documents.\n\nThe court moved a hearing scheduled for Monday from McCormick's usual courtroom to the largest in the building to accommodate the 47 attorneys from 19 law firms appearing in the case, as well as potential stockholders.\n\nTESLA'S 2ND QUARTER DELIVERIES BETTER THAN EXPECTED Tesla's stock turned positive for the year last week after it had been down by more than 20% year to date in recent months.\n\nTornetta's legal team argues they deserve the fee as compensation for the benefit they say Tesla received when the court voided Musk's pay package \u2014 which would return around 266 million shares to Tesla that had been reserved for Musk's stock options. That stock would be worth about $67 billion at Friday's price of $251.82 per share, though it was valued at $56 billion when the judge voided the compensation package.\n\nHis attorneys say it's the largest judgment ever awarded by an American court, excluding punitive damages. They argue they should receive a fee of 11% of that judgment and receive that compensation in the form of 29 million Tesla shares \u2014 though they say they would've been justified in asking for up to 33% of the value of Musk's pay package.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fee request would far exceed the current record fee in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action suit, according to Stanford Law School.\n\nTESLA INVESTORS TURN STOCK AROUND; ROBOTAXI BUZZ HEATS UP Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved to change the EV maker's incorporation state from Delaware to Texas in response to the court voiding his pay package.\n\nTesla argues that because the company's shareholders voted in June to re-ratify Musk's pay package, Tornetta's initial legal victory has been transformed into a loss \u2014 so his lawsuit hasn't conveyed any benefit to Tesla or its shareholders and Tornetta's legal team should receive as little as $13.6 million.\n\nMusk's pay package, which has no salary or bonuses and is based on stock options awarded in tranches as the electric vehicle-maker achieves performance-based milestones.\n\nThe judge voided it in January after finding that the company's board of directors didn't adequately disclose some directors' close personal relationships with Musk or that the company was on pace to achieve many of its performance-based goals.\n\nMcCormick may take weeks or months to issue a ruling in the case. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently considering a $267 million fee request in a shareholder class action lawsuit involving Dell Technologies and a decision in that case could guide the Court of Chancery's decision on the Tesla fee request.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Tesla investors call for judge to reject 'outlandish' $7 billion legal fee in Musk's pay case\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla's stock (TSLA) extended its rally to nine consecutive days Monday, eking out a 0.5% gain.\n\nThe stock's winning streak has erased year-to-date losses in a remarkably quick turnaround. Shares have risen more than 75% since 52-week lows hit in April.\n\nThe extended rally comes as the car manufacturer beat on quarterly deliveries last week. Aside from production and delivery results, Tesla bulls have also highlighted the company\u2019s fastest-growing segment \u2014 its energy storage business.\n\nSmaller electric vehicle makers also reported better than expected deliveries last quarter.\n\nOn Monday, Lucid (LCID) shares jumped almost 7% after the luxury EV startup topped production and delivery expectations for the second quarter. Chinese competitors Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO), and XPeng (XPEV) also recently reported better-than-expected quarterly deliveries.\n\nTesla slumped in the first half of 2024 amid tough competition abroad and some waning demand for EVs in the US. In an effort to reduce costs, the company embarked on a plan to cut more than 10% of its global staff earlier this year in what some analysts saw as a signal of tough times ahead.\n\nTesla also slashed prices last year to spur sales and better compete with its Chinese peers.\n\n\"There is still the risk of further price cuts ahead, and there [are] still further questions on fundamentals, we are still facing somewhat of an EV winter on demand,\" Barclays senior equity research analyst Dan Levy told Yahoo Finance last week. \"So, good result. But I think the fundamental macro backdrop is still the same.\"\n\nLevy has an Equal Weight rating on the stock and a $180 price target, which implies a near-30% drop from current levels.\n\nThe car maker will report its quarterly results on July 23 after the market close. Analysts are also looking ahead to Aug. 8, when the company is set to unveil its much-anticipated robotaxi.\n\n\"The key for Tesla's stock is the Street recognizing that Tesla is the most undervalued AI play in the market,\" Wedbush managing director Dan Ives wrote in a note this week as he raised his price target on the stock to $300 from $275 with a new bull case of $400 for 2025.\n\nIves added the company's robotaxi event on Aug. 8 \"will lay the yellow brick road to [full self-driving] and an autonomous future.\" A Tesla Cybertruck (AP/Richard Vogel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Toyota Has Finally Hit The Accelerator On Its EV Journey\n\nLast week, Toyota Motor\u00a0(NYSE: TM) revelaed its second quarter deliveries, joining Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). In a nutshell, Toyota has something to brag about as its EV sales quadrupled in the second quarter.\n\nSecond Quarter Sales\n\nIn the U.S. Toyota sold 621,549\u00a0vehicles, which is a rise of 9.2 % YoY and it owes it to EVs. In the second quarter, Toyota sold almost 250,000 hybrid and electric models, which represents an even more impressive YoY rise of 63%, representing\u00a0almost 40% of the group's total volume.\u00a0EVs and PHEVs are undoubtedly Toyota\u2019s fastest-growing segment.\n\nToyota\u2019s current offering hybrids, plug-in hybrids and a fuel-cell electric vehicle consists of 29 electrified models, which is two more compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe Toyota Group\u00a0group sold 24,266 plug-in electric cars, which translates to a 112% YoY increase, with these vehicles making 3.9% of the total volume, rising from last year\u2019s 2.0%. The Toyota brand enjoyed a 91% YoY boost as it reported 17,589 plug-in sales, while its hybrid star,\u00a0Lexus,\u00a0almost tripled its volume that grew 194% to 6,677.\n\nToyota definitely stepped on the accelerator pedal in the EV race.\n\nThe group's all-electric car sales increased by 301% YoY to 11,607 units.\u00a0For the first time in history, 1.9% of all Toyota Motor North America sales were all-electric, rising from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when they made 0.5%.During the first half of 2024, Toyota Group\u00a0\u00a0sold 42,098 plug-ins, which is double compared to the first half of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the EV king, Tesla is reflecting a softening EV demand.\n\nTesla revealed its global deliveries contracted by 4.8% in the second quarter to around 444,000 EVs. This is the second consecutive quarter that Tesla is reporting a volume drop, after reporting an 8.5% YoY decline in the first quarter. But fortunately for Tesla, the latest fall was milder than what analysts expected.\n\nLong gone are the days that Tesla the EV market almost to itself. With intensified competition from BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) and even newcomers like Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO), Tesla is forced to fight for its place under the EV sun. In addition, legacy automakers like Toyota, GM and Ford are determined to catch up. Although the Chinese brands succeeded to undercut Tesla on price in their home market, legacy automakers undoubtedly have their know-how on their side in building their competitive advantage on. By the looks of it, Toyota has finally picked up the pace, so the EV race is about to get even more interesting.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Nvidia Dethrones Tesla as Single-Stock ETF King With 400% Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 There\u2019s a new stock reigning supreme in a speculative part of the ETF investment landscape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android Boeing to Plead Guilty to Fraud for Violating Deal Over 737 Max Crashes Biden Narrows Gap With Trump in Swing States Despite Debate Loss Hedge Funds That Piled Into Big Tesla Short Stung by Rally Morgan Stanley\u2019s Wilson Says a 10% Stock Market Correction Is \u2018Highly Likely\u2019\n\nThanks to the relentless artificial-intelligence boom, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) now holds a commanding position in exchange-traded funds that track a single company \u2014 representing more than half of all assets across so-called single-stock ETFs, over $6 billion in total. Meanwhile Tesla Inc. (TSLA) centric funds represent just a fifth of all holdings in the sector, down from two-thirds last year, according to data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nEven as the electric-car maker enjoys a stock rebound, its stature among day traders has diminished. These days, they\u2019re increasingly lured by the riches on offer trading the world\u2019s pre-eminent chip designer via the amped-up ETFs.\n\nAll told, Nvidia-focused ETFs have taken in $4.4 billion so far this year, roughly six times more than what they garnered during all of 2023, according to the BI data. Meanwhile, flows into funds tracking only Tesla amount to just over $1 billion this year, compared with last year\u2019s $2.8 billion haul.\n\n\u201cNVDA funds have become more popular given investors\u2019 focus on the AI theme and the stock\u2019s strong outperformance,\u201d a JPMorgan research team including Bram Kaplan wrote in a recent note.\n\nSingle-stock ETFs, which offer juiced-up or inverse returns on their underlying companies, launched two years ago. There are currently around 60 such funds listed in the US, with about $13 billion in total assets. Besides Tesla and Nvidia, there are also funds tracking companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\n\nWhen regulators allowed these types of funds to launch in 2022, they said they presented a \u201cparticular risk,\u201d as worries swirled about how retail traders might use them. Indeed, they\u2019ve become so popular that one issuer is even looking to introduce a 2x MicroStrategy Inc. ETF that, if launched, would become the most volatile fund to debut in the US, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we should continue to be concerned that retail investors still do not fully understand how single-stock ETFs are designed to be utilized, namely for intraday use and not as part of a long-term investment strategy,\u201d said Amrita Nandakumar, president of Vident Asset Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, funds tied to Tesla held the majority of single-stock-ETF assets and also accounted for the vast bulk of the cohort\u2019s daily trading volumes. Its famous volatility likely drew a lot of traders in \u2014 it gained 102% in 2023, after a 65% drop the year prior.\n\nBut this year has been all about Nvidia and the AI craze it has sparked and continues to fuel. One of the single-stock ETF standouts among the bunch focused on the firm has been GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (ticker NVDL), which gives investors two times the daily return of the underlying shares. Amid the fund\u2019s 400% year-to-date rally, its assets have grown to nearly $5 billion from around $210 million at the start of the year. It can now consistently be found among the most-traded ETFs on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cIf you love Nvidia, you\u2019re going to love 2x Nvidia even more,\u201d GraniteShares founder and CEO Will Rhind said on Bloomberg TV\u2019s ETF IQ recently. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go where the enthusiasm is,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthe whole conversation is dominated by Nvidia, and that\u2019s why I think Nvidia is the most important stock in the world right now. So it goes without saying we\u2019re going to get an ecosystem around Nvidia.\u201d\n\n\u2014With assistance from Athanasios Psarofagis.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch Dragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ford (F) Q2 US EV Sales Trail Only Tesla: Buy The Stock Now?",
        "content": "It seems that the whole narrative of a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market might just have been a tad bit exaggerated. At least, that\u2019s what we can draw from second-quarter EV sales in the United States. Most of the auto biggies reported impressive U.S. EV deliveries.\n\nThe e-mobility giant Tesla TSLA delivered 443,956 cars worldwide in the second quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 439,000 as compiled by FactSet.\u00a0Just behind Tesla was the legacy automaker, Ford F, in terms of EV sales in the United States in the June end quarter. It was the #2 EV brand in the country, topping its crosstown rival General Motors GM, which itself reported record EV deliveries in the quarter under discussion.\n\nWhile high prices and inadequate charging infrastructure remain concerns for zero-emission vehicles, the outlook for the EV market is more optimistic than previously believed. The long-term future of mobility clearly leans toward electrification. And Ford is making considerable strides to maintain a strong footing in the EV market.\n\nIn this write-up, we will take a look at Ford's robust EV sales, explore the factors likely to drive Ford in the long term and assess whether now is a good time to invest in its shares.\n\nFord\u2019s Impressive Q2 EV Deliveries\n\nThe company sold 23,957 EVs in the second quarter of 2024 in the United States, marking a 61% jump year over year. In terms of models, sales of Mustang Mach E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit totaled 12,645, 7,902 and 3,410 units, up 46%, 77% and 96%, respectively. Notably, F-150 Lightning remains America\u2019s top-selling electric truck and E-Transit is the nation\u2019s best-selling electric van.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Ford delivered more than 44,000 EVs in the country, nearly 72% up on a yearly basis. Ford's growth allowed it to maintain a lead over GM in the U.S. EV market. GM delivered 21,930 EVs in the second quarter, bringing its total to 38,355 for the first half of 2024.\n\nFord Model e Unit Poised for Long-Term Growth\n\nFord's EV segment is strategically positioned for robust growth through a multifaceted approach. Key strategies include scaling, leveraging digital capabilities for manufacturing efficiency and emphasizing vertical integration by insourcing critical components. The company aims to increase integration by nearly 50% in next-gen utility vehicles. Addressing the substantial cost of batteries, Ford is prioritizing energy efficiency and aims for one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the United States.\n\nFord Blue & Pro Units Also Spark Optimism\n\nIn the Ford Blue segment, the company has tremendous growth opportunities, particularly with highly coveted models such as the F-150, the Maverick, the Bronco, and, undoubtedly, the Mustang. A wave of new products, including the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator will boost revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the Ford Pro segment, strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future. The segment is well-positioned to leverage these factors, driving significant growth. We expect adjusted EBIT from the segment to increase 24.3% year over year in 2024, driven by favorable mix and volume strength.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nWith shares down around 15% year to date, it might be an opportune time to buy the dip on the back of strong fundamentals. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company is trading cheap compared to the industry and carries a Value Score of A. F\u2019s forward sales multiple sits at 0.31. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFord is Worth Buying Now\n\nAlthough the Ford Model e unit is set to suffer losses this year, long-term prospects are promising enough. The Ford+ plan, emphasizing profit growth, e-mobility, and customer satisfaction, shows promise. High liquidity of more than $43 billion provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities. To investors\u2019 delight, the company targets distributions of 40-50% of FCF going forward, demonstrating its commitment to shareholder return. Amid all these tailwinds, the stock is witnessing northbound estimates for 2024 and 2025.

        "title": "Musk\u2019s AI Deal Could Send Dell Stock Soaring: Time to Buy Before It\u2019s Too Late?",
        "content": "Is Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) a dinosaur in 2024? Not anymore! The company is transforming into an AI server infrastructure provider. Consider Dell stock if you like investing in underdogs with compelling turnaround stories.\n\nToday, we won\u2019t delve deeply into quarterly earnings reports. Instead, we\u2019ll be sourcing our information from very brief postings on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nTrust me when I tell you that these aren\u2019t trivial X postings. They contain potentially game-changing announcements, and growth investors as well as value seekers will definitely want to pay attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis Is Huge News for Dell\n\nLet me back up for a moment and recap some background information. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk started an AI-focused company called xAI. Furthermore, xAI is developing Grok, which is an AI chatbot that\u2019s meant to compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nNow, let\u2019s fast-forward to June 19. That\u2019s when Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell posted on X, \u201cWe\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with @nvidia to power @grok for @xai @elonmusk.\u201d Just the revelation that Dell is collaborating with the almighty Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already huge news for Dell Technologies.\n\nAlso on June 19, Musk clarified in a X posting, \u201cTo be precise, Dell is assembling half of the racks that are going into the supercomputer that xAI is building.\u201d\n\nThen, that same day, Musk posted on X that \u201cSMC\u201d or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) will build the other half of the AI-supercomputer racks.\n\nAt this point, if you envision a bright future for xAI and Grok, then you might be tempted to load up on Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nYou can do this if you\u2019d like, since an arrangement with Musk is usually great news. Yet, I encourage you to consider investing in Dell, as well.\n\nDell: From Underdog to AI Hero?\n\nMy objection to investing in Super Micro Computer right now is that the market already assigned a very rich valuation to the company. There\u2019s no underdog story here, since Super Micro Computer is already the top dog.\n\nIn contrast, Dell Technologies has been out of favor, and perhaps even a punchline, for years. After all, young people don\u2019t rely on PCs anymore. However, Dell\u2019s reinvention as a developer of AI-ready PCs means that the company can rise from the ashes in 2024.\n\nActually, the company is already rising and reclaiming some of its former glory. Dell stock\u2019s year-to-date rally has been impressive, but it\u2019s not overdone. The company could still be considered an underdog, or at least not a market darling yet, based on Dell\u2019s valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe can apply a couple of commonly cited metrics to support our point. On a trailing 12-month basis, Dell\u2019s GAAP price-to-earnings ratio is 28.27x. For comparison\u2019s sake, the sector median P/E ratio is 30.22x, and Super Micro Computer\u2019s P/E ratio is 46.18x.\n\nSome folks prefer to use the price-to-sales ratio instead of the P/E ratio, and that\u2019s not a problem. As it turns out, Dell Technologies\u2019 trailing 12-month P/S ratio is 1.1x, versus the sector median P/S ratio of 2.98x.\n\nMoreover, Super Micro Computer\u2019s P/S ratio is 3.8x. Thus, it\u2019s not difficult to determine which company involved in the Musk deal has the more attractive valuation.\n\nDell Stock: The Turnaround Story Is Just Getting Started\n\nDell Technologies still isn\u2019t a heavily favored technology company like Super Micro Computer or Nvidia are. Yet, the deal with Musk and xAI should put Dell in the limelight and bring some reluctant investors into the fold.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock could also be worth buying if it comes down 20% or 30%. However, if you want to get involved in a turnaround story that\u2019s just getting started, you can buy Dell stock right now. It\u2019s a great way to get immediate AI-server industry exposure for your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nio Stock Gets a D Grade: Why Investors Should Steer Clear in H2",
        "content": "Many methods offer exposure to the global electric vehicle market. Investing in China-based EV manufacturer\u00a0Nio (NYSE:NIO)\u00a0simply isn\u2019t your best bet in 2024\u2019s second half.\u00a0NIO stock had a significant decline in the first half, receiving a \u201cD\u201d grade with little confidence.\n\nSure, a miracle could happen during the remaining months of the year and Nio\u2019s loyal investors might be vindicated somehow. After all, Nio has high hopes for the current quarter.\n\nBut then, when expectations are very high, it\u2019s easy for a company to fall short. If that occurs, NIO stock will have no floor (except for zero) and plenty of room to collapse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s Have a Convo About Onvo\n\nNow\u2019s as good a time as any to have a \u201cconvo\u201d (conversation) about Nio\u2019s highly touted Onvo vehicle model lineup. Believe it or not, Nio expects its Onvo mid-size SUVs to create a \u201cbetter family life.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a high calling for an SUV model, to say the least. In order to generate robust revenue, however, Nio\u2019s Onvo vehicles will need to stand out. After all, there\u2019s fierce competition from a slew of EV makers, including the much more famous and well-capitalized Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nHowever, Onvo might end up being a clone or copycat of vehicles that Tesla has already produced. We found reports suggesting that the Onvo L60 electric SUV features an oval-shaped steering wheelthat has minimal buttons, which are similar to components of Tesla\u2019s comparable EV models.\n\nOther Tesla-reminiscent Onvo features may include a glass roof, as well as a gear shifter that\u2019s located below the steering wheel\u2019s right side. We\u2019re not claiming that these similarities are fully confirmed.\n\nYet, it\u2019s a cause for concern if Nio may be guilty of \u201cborrowing\u201d features of Tesla\u2019s current and past EV models.\n\nNio\u2019s Great Expectations Could Backfire\n\nAs we previously discussed in depth, Nio has to deal with ongoing trade frictions between China and the U.S., as well as between China and Europe. Amid this highly challenging backdrop, one might conclude that Nio ought to maintain muted expectations.\n\nYet, Nio is actually doubling down with its current-quarter expectations. Stunningly, Nio guided for second-quarter 2024 vehicle deliveries \u201cbetween 54,000 and 56,000 units.\u201d\n\nWe used the word \u201cstunningly\u201d because Nio\u2019s outlook implies that the automaker\u2019s vehicle deliveries will more than double. More specifically, Nio\u2019s guidance range predicts year-over-year vehicle-delivery growth of around 129.6% to 138.1%.\n\nFurthermore, Nio has to overcome international trade frictions and restrictions and nearly double its revenue, somehow.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current quarter, Nio expects its revenue to grow by approximately 89.1% to 95.3% year-over-year to the equivalent of $2.373 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a \u201cbig ask,\u201d to put it mildly, as Nio contends with tariff-related issues and Tesla\u2019s EV price cuts.\n\nNIO Stock: Don\u2019t Assume a Bounce Is Imminent\n\nIt\u2019s entirely understandable if Nio\u2019s loyal shareholders are running out of patience. They lost money on their\u00a0investment in Nio during 2024\u2019s first half. Now, the year\u2019s second half is starting and Nio has sky-high sales goals.\n\nHowever, it won\u2019t be easy for Nio\u00a0to meet or exceed those lofty goals. Frankly, it\u2019s a tough time for China-based EV sellers.\n\nMoreover, Nio is placing an awful lot of emphasis on its Onvo models. This could be problematic if the company doesn\u2019t make its Onvo vehicles more unique.\n\nConsequently, we\u2019re giving NIO stock a \u201cD\u201d grade. Despite Nio\u2019s great expectations, investors shouldn\u2019t expect a miraculous share-price comeback to occur in the near future.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget A.I.

        "title": "Tesla investors to urge judge to reject record $7 billion legal fee in Musk pay case",
        "content": "By Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Tesla shareholders will appear in court on Monday to argue that an unprecedented request for more than $7 billion in attorneys' fees to be paid by the company is \"outlandish,\" the latest twist in a legal showdown over Musk's $56 billion pay package.\n\nThe record fee request was made by investor Richard Tornetta on behalf of three law firms that represented him, including Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. Tornetta owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over Musk's pay package of stock options in 2018, a legal battle he ultimately won in January when the package was voided.\n\nThe fee equals around $7.2 billion at Tesla's Friday's stock price and amounts to a rate of roughly $370,000 for every hour worked by the 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals, some of whom normally bill as little as $275 an hour, according to court documents submitted Tornetta's lawyers.\n\n\"The legal fees appear exceedingly disproportionate and outlandish,\" Nathan Chiu, a Tesla shareholder from New Jersey, wrote to Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in March, according to a court filing.\n\nChiu, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and more than 8,000 Tesla stockholders have flooded the Delaware Chancery Court with some 1,500 letters and objections over the fee, according to court documents.\n\nA hearing scheduled for Monday was moved from McCormick's usual courtroom to the largest in the building to accommodate the 47 attorneys from 19 law firms appearing in the case, as well potential stockholders.\n\nTornetta's lawyers argue they deserve the fee as a cut of the benefit they say they conveyed to Tesla when a judge voided Musk's pay package, which returned to Tesla around 266 million shares reserved for the stock options. That stock would be worth about $67 billion at Friday's price of $251.82 per share.\n\nTornetta's attorneys said it is the largest judgment ever awarded by an American court, excluding punitive damages. They argued they should receive a fee equal to 11% of that judgment, a percentage that is arguably conservative by Delaware legal precedent. They asked to be paid in the form of 29 million Tesla shares.\n\nRECORD FEE REQUEST\n\nWhile federal courts tend to lower the fee as a percentage of judgments or settlements as they get bigger, Delaware courts have gone the opposite way, awarding a larger percentage as an incentive for attorneys to push for a bigger recovery.\n\nTornetta's legal team said they would have been justified asking for up to 33% of the value of Musk's pay package.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fee request vastly outstrips the current record fee in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action, according to Stanford Law School.\n\nThe Musk case took a dramatic turn when Tesla shareholders in June voted to ratify Musk's pay, which Tesla has argued corrected the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick identified in her ruling.\n\nThe company argues that Musk's pay package has been restored and that Tornetta's legal victory has been transformed into a loss. As a result, the case conveyed no benefit to Tesla and the shareholder lawyers should receive as little as $13.6 million, Tesla said.\n\nSome of the shareholders who have opposed the request wrote form letters to the judge, but a few have hired attorneys to file formal objections to the fee, including Amy Steffens, a pilot, and Kurt Panouses, an attorney who specializes in representing lottery winners.\n\nMcCormick may take weeks or months to rule. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently considering a $267 million fee request in a shareholder class action involving Dell Technologies and that decision could provide fee guidance.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -A record $7 billion in attorneys' fees for three firms that successfully challenged Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package provides an incentive for lawyers to hold corporate boards accountable, an attorney for a company shareholder told a Delaware judge on Monday.\n\nFor more than six hours, legal teams for the company and a shareholder sparred over how much to award to three law firms which represented Richard Tornetta, who owned nine shares of Tesla when he sued over Musk's pay package in 2018.\n\nThe fee Tornetta has asked for on behalf of the firms equals around $7.3 billion at Tesla's Monday stock price and amounts to a rate of roughly $370,000 for every hour worked by the 37 lawyers, associates and paralegals, court documents submitted by Tornetta's lawyers showed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohn Reed, Tesla's lawyer, said on Monday that the fee petition never should have been filed.\n\n\"It looks like a real-life lawyer joke,\" he told Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery.\n\nThe legal fee represents a cut of the value that the plaintiff's lawyers say was created for Tesla by a Delaware judge's January ruling that rescinded Musk's $56-billion pay package.\n\nThe firms that represented Tornetta include Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann.\n\nTornetta's attorney Greg Varallo said the shareholder's legal team was seeking far less than the law allows, which is up to 33% of the benefit to Tesla from the lawsuit.\n\nHe said the January ruling was the largest judgment ever by an American court, excluding punitive damages, and argued that Tornetta's lawyers should receive 11% of that judgment paid in the form of 29 million Tesla shares.\n\nVarallo argued that a large fee award would encourage shareholder attorneys to try to protect small investors.\n\n\"If Delaware continues to perceive value in policing bad behavior, then narrowing incentives would be a very bad idea,\" Varallo said.\n\nStory continues\n\nReed countered that the January ruling destroyed value by sending Tesla's stock down as it created uncertainty about Musk's future at the company.\n\nHe asked McCormick to award as little as $13.6 million as a fee.\n\nMore than 8,000 Tesla stockholders have flooded the court with some 1,500 letters and objections over the fee, according to court documents.\n\nThe request vastly outstrips the current record fee in shareholder litigation of $688 million in an Enron class action, according to Stanford Law School.\n\nThe Musk case took a dramatic turn when Tesla shareholders in June voted to ratify Musk's pay, which Tesla has argued corrected the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick identified in her ruling.\n\nThe company argues that Musk's pay package has been restored and that Tornetta's legal victory has been transformed into a loss.\n\nMcCormick will hear arguments about the legal impact of the ratification vote in the coming weeks.\n\nMcCormick may take weeks or months to rule on the legal fee.

        "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): The Best Stock to Buy According to Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 New Stocks Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets Is Buying. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other WallStreetBets-approved stocks.\n\nThe surge of the Internet and the easy access to financial information, courtesy of the personal computing revolution, means that investing is no longer limited to the professionals. While Wall Street of the 1950s and onward was made of traders relying on hand made graphs of daily stock price movements to decipher long term trends, now, anyone with a computer and an internet connection has access to similar and more sophisticated tools.\n\nThis has also led to the rise of retail investing, which first made its mark during the coronavirus pandemic. Between 2020 and 2021, more than thirty million brokerage accounts were opened in the US, and the low interest rates coupled with coronavirus stimulus checks led to these traders accounting for 15% of the market's trading volume in September 2020. Data from investment bank Morgan Stanley shows that retail traders tend to prefer well known consumer facing stocks, and crucially, the bank's proprietary methodologies also show that in the five years between 2016 and 2021, stocks that garnered interest from retail investors ended up outperforming those without it.\n\nBuilding on this, the pandemic and the surge of information in today's age have also shifted the dynamics of how America views wealth preservation. A fresh survey from Gallup shows that while real estate continues to dominate as Americans' favorite investment regardless of their income bracket, stocks come in second place for middle and high income families. This preference for equities dropped after the Great Recession of 2008 which wiped out some of the biggest companies in the world after risky bets on mortgage securities shattered Wall Street's public image. According to Gallup's data, the percentage of Americans who own stocks is the highest in 2024 since 2007 - or before the global economic crisis. Stock ownership stood at 52% of those polled - an all time low - in 2013 and 2016.\n\nIt slowly picked up and sat at 55% in 2020, and has risen every year since then to a post 2007 high of 62% in 2024. In fact, the last time stock ownership was higher than it is right now was in 2004 when 63% of Americans owned stocks during an era when interest rates were relatively low and the housing market was booming - economic conditions that are on a completely different spectrum than what we're experiencing right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, the divergence between retail investors and hedge funds came to the forefront of the investing world during the meme stock mania that saw the former pump up video game retailing and entertainment chain stocks as they rallied on social media and particularly Reddit's WallStreetBets, this trend continued in 2023. Data from S&P shows that in October when market sentiment about interest rates and the economy was at its lowest, retail investors sold off $15.64 billion in stocks for their largest monthly outflow since 2021. However, at the same time, the hedge funds appeared to smell blood. In a classic illustration of Warren Buffett's mantra of being greedy when others are fearful, the hedge funds bought $5.56 billion in stocks. Their three favorite sectors were real estate, utilities, and materials, with real estate and utilities witnessing the inflows after smart money flew out in the prior month. For some great Warren Buffett quotes, you can check out Warren Buffett\u2019s 35 Best Quotes About Business, Investing, and Life.\n\nJudging by this, it appears that retail investors are driven by their economic perceptions instead of setting up their portfolios during a downturn. This is also evident in Charles Schwab's Trader Sentiment Survey released in February 2024. The bank's data reveals that 52% of retail traders planned to move more money into stocks during Q1 2024, which marks a 7 percentage point sequential gain. This also coincides with their view of the economy, as 48% think that the US will avoid a recession in 2024 and 53% are bullish for the stock market.\n\nWith this context and as retail traders start to become bullish once again, we decided to take a look at how their previous bets have performed. The GameStop short squeeze of 2021 brought the Reddit subreddit WallStreetBets into the limelight and made Roaring Kitty a global celebrity. We covered some WallStreetBets stocks in 2021 and 2023, and in this piece, we'll analyze how the top 2021 stocks have performed since then. If you're interested in similar content, we also evaluated Cathie Wood's stock performance as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of stocks, we took a look at our 2021 coverage of Forget AMC and Gamestop: 10 New Stocks Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets Is Buying and evaluated how these stocks have performed since June 2021. The stocks are re-ranked according to their share price percentage performance.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nShare Price Performance Since July 2021 Start: 11.14%Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 74\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only WallStreetBets stock that is actually in the green since 2021. This is unsurprising, as, during this time, the firm has managed to prove its critics wrong and establish a dominant position in the global EV market through its robust production base. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) made 206,421 cars in Q2 2021 and doubled this figure to 433,371 cars in Q1 2024. During that time period, it set up two new factories - one in Germany and another in China. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also competing in the cutthroat Chinese electric vehicle market, and its heft coupled with a global production base allows it considerable advantages not only over Chinese companies in the Chinese market, but also globally since it can leverage its delivery and supply chains to gain an edge. Additionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) also benefits from a rather diversified business model that also focuses on energy storage. This business boomed during Q2 2024 when Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) deployed 9.4GWh of energy storage products which set a new record in its history. The stock gained 20% in the first five days of July on the back of this news, despite the holidays.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\nTesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and asells electric vehicles (EVs), related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Shares fell 29.3% in the first quarter as the core automotive segment is facing headwinds due to a complex macroeconomic environment, factory shutdowns, growing competitive risks in China, and vehicle price reductions which are pressuring gross margins. During the first quarter of 2024, production was also negatively impacted by the Red Sea maritime supply- chain interferences, sabotage in a Tesla factory\u2019s power supply in Berlin, and a factory closure for the launch of the refreshed Model 3. We remain shareholders. Tesla commenced delivery of its highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup, which features new technologies within the car and its manufacturing lines. Tesla also launched version 12 of its Full Self Driving product, which shows significant progress from prior versions and increases the probability that Tesla\u2019s data collection at scale, and verticalized software and hardware approach will position Tesla as a leader in the future for autonomous driving and shared mobility. We also expect energy storage sales to continue to grow over the coming years as the adoption of renewable energy continues. Lastly, we believe Tesla\u2019s core automotive segment will recover with the company remaining a leader in the EV market, which continues to expand with EVs still accounting for only around 10% of vehicle sales globally.\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of the WallStreetBets-approved stocks to buy. You can visit Forget AMC and Gamestop: 10 New Stocks Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets Is Buying to see the other WallStreetBets-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Hedge Funds That Piled Into Big Tesla Short Stung by Huge Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds piled into short bets against Tesla Inc. right before the electric vehicle maker unveiled a set of numbers that triggered a hefty share-price rally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Narrows Gap With Trump in Swing States Despite Debate Loss Le Pen Party Seeks Major French Election Win: What to Watch Singapore Is Making Life Tougher for Global Talent Biden\u2019s Defiant Interview Is Unlikely to Calm Nerves Iran Elects President Who Wants to Revive Nuclear Talks With West\n\nAbout 18% of the 500-plus hedge funds tracked by data provider Hazeltree had an overall short position on Tesla at the end of June, the highest percentage in more than a year, according to figures shared with Bloomberg. That compares with just under 15% at the end of March.\n\nThose contrarian bets now threaten to saddle the hedge funds behind them with losses. Tesla\u2019s latest vehicle-sales results, published on July 2, revealed second-quarter deliveries figures that beat average analyst estimates, even though sales were down. Investors pounced on the news, driving the company\u2019s shares to a six-month high. Since the beginning of June, Tesla\u2019s share price has now soared about 40%.\n\nTesla is likely to see its profit margins improve, helped by lower production and raw material costs, according to Morningstar Inc.\u2019s Seth Goldstein, one of the top three analysts covering the stock in a Bloomberg ranking that tracks price recommendations.\n\nThe company will likely \u201creturn to profit growth\u201d next year, he said in a note to clients. But how Tesla handles the market\u2019s intensifying focus on affordable EVs will be key, he added.\n\nThe development feeds into an ongoing sense of uncertainty around how to treat the wider EV market, amid a sea of conflicting dynamics. The industry \u2014 a key plank in the global race to reach net zero emissions by 2050 \u2014 benefits from generous tax credits. Yet it\u2019s also contending with significant hurdles in the form of tariff wars and even identity politics, with some consumers rejecting EVs as a form of \u201cwoke\u201d transport.\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump has said that if he becomes president again after November\u2019s election, he\u2019ll undo existing laws supporting battery-powered vehicles, calling them \u201ccrazy.\u201d That said, Trump is a \u201chuge fan\u201d of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, according to Elon Musk, the EV giant\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nMeanwhile, the list of internal disruptions at Tesla is long. In April, Musk told staff to brace for major job cuts, with sales roles among those affected. And the Cybertruck, Tesla\u2019s first new consumer model in years, has been slow to ramp up.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor that reason, some hedge fund managers have decided the stock is off bounds altogether. Tesla is \u201cvery difficult for us to position,\u201d said Fabio Pecce, chief investment officer at Ambienta where he oversees $700 million, including managing the Ambienta x Alpha hedge fund.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s not clear whether investors are dealing with \u201ca top company with a great management team\u201d or whether it\u2019s \u201ca challenged franchise with deficient corporate governance,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, \u201cif Trump wins, it is truly going to be very positive\u201d for Tesla, though \u201cobviously not amazing for EVs and renewables in general,\u201d he said. That\u2019s because Trump is expected to impose \u201cmassive tariffs towards the Chinese players,\u201d which would be \u201cbeneficial\u201d to Tesla, Pecce said.\n\nInvestors ended 2023 declaring they\u2019d likely retreat further from green stocks in general, and EVs specifically, according to a Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey. Almost two-thirds of the 620 respondents said they planned to stay away from the EV sector, with close to 60% expecting the iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund to extend its slide in 2024. The ETF has lost 13% so far this year after sinking more than 20% in 2023.\n\nThe Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Price Return Index, whose members include BYD Co., Tesla and Rivian Automotive Inc., is down about 22% so far in 2024. At the same time, the metals and minerals needed to produce batteries are at the mercy of wildly volatile commodities markets, with speculators regularly trying to make a quick buck on shifts in supply and demand. Price volatility means some battery manufacturers are having to adjust to a market in which their profit margins have been getting badly squeezed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, more traditional automakers are finding themselves under pressure from shareholders to slow down their capital expenditure on EVs, with recent examples including Porsche AG. Polestar Automotive Holding UK Plc, a high-end EV manufacturer, has lost almost 95% of its value since being spun out of Volvo Car AB two years ago. Fisker Inc., another luxury EV maker, saw its value wiped out starting last year and has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nSoren Aandahl, founder and CIO of Texas-based Blue Orca Capital, said \u201cvaluations in the EV space are so beat up\u201d that he\u2019s now avoiding shorting the sector. It\u2019s no longer an obvious contrarian bet, because those tend to do best if investors enter \u201cwhen things are a little bit higher,\u201d he said. But at this point, \u201ca lot of the air\u2019s already come out of the balloon.\u201d\n\nBut Eirik Hogner, deputy portfolio manager at $2.7 billion hedge fund Clean Energy Transition, suggests there may be more pain to come for the wider EV industry. There are still \u201cway too many\u201d startups that remain \u201csub-scale\u201d and with gross margins that are simply \u201ctoo low,\u201d he said. As a result, the supply-demand dynamic of the EV market \u201cis still very negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, I think you need to see more bankruptcies\u201d before the market starts to look healthier, Hogner said.\n\n--With assistance from Craig Trudell.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Where Will Tesla Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Share prices of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are up roughly 21% in five days since it was reported that second-quarter vehicle deliveries beat Wall Street's expectations. However, the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer's longer-term downward trend remains in effect as it grapples with high interest rates, competition, and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nCould the second-quarter deliveries indicate a sustainable recovery, or will Tesla continue fading out? Let's explore what the next five years could have in store for this innovative EV leader.\n\nSecond-quarter deliveries beat expectations -- or did they?\n\nTesla investors don't have to wait until earnings (expected to be released this month) to get updated on the company's performance. Management typically releases production and delivery data along with other vehicle manufacturers on a quarterly basis (it used to be released monthly). And the much-anticipated second-quarter numbers were no exception.\n\nWith 443,956 cars delivered in the second quarter, Tesla beat Wall Street's consensus forecast of 439,000. But this is still down 4.8% from the prior-year period and represents the second consecutive quarter of declining deliveries after a 13% year-over-year drop in the first quarter.\n\nThe better-than-expected delivery numbers sparked a double-digit percentage rally in the stock price, but the automaker is not out of the woods yet. The extent of the weakness could be revealed when the company releases its full quarterly report.\n\nSeveral key problems might come up. First is pricing. Automakers can drive volume growth by lowering prices. But this can come at the expense of revenue per car sold and margins. For Tesla, this could pose a big problem because its previously high margins are the main thing differentiating it from its uninspiring mass-market rivals.\n\nIn the first quarter, its operating margins fell from 11.4% to 5.5%. And continued declines could turn the company into just another automaker.\n\nMusk to the rescue?\n\nWith a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 6.33, its stock trades at a significant premium over the typical large U.S. automaker. For context, Ford Motor Company and General Motors trade for a P/S of just 0.3 and 0.36, respectively. And if Tesla becomes just another car company, it could lose much of its $560 billion valuation. Shareholders are betting that CEO Elon Musk won't let this happen.\n\nFresh off securing an equity-based pay package worth $44.9 billion, Musk is incentivized to do everything possible to boost the stock price. He seems to be downplaying the automotive opportunity in favor of new growth drivers like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company is working on Dojo, a supercomputer designed to help train its machine-learning models for full self-driving (FSD). While Tesla isn't the only company tackling this effort, it has some advantages because of the vast amount of user data it can gather from its customers with FSD software installed in their cars. Musk says its robotaxi will be revealed on Aug. 8, along with its next-gen vehicle platform.\n\nIf the robotaxis are consumer-ready, they could unlock a new nonautomotive revenue stream for Tesla, while putting it in a prime position to explore other AI uses like warehouse automation or possibly even humanoid robots over the next five years and beyond.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nTesla has once again become a highly speculative company. If current trends continue, its previously high-margin EV business could become commodified over the next five years amid rising competition and lower pricing power. This isn't enough to justify the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 57 compared to the Nasdaq Composite's average P/E of 32.\n\nInvestors who buy the stock now are betting on Elon Musk and his ability to transform the company into more than just an automaker through AI and robotics. This is a tall order. And the controversial executive has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering.\n\nWith that said, Musk has rescued Tesla from the brink on several occasions, so there is good reason for the market to have some faith in him. The stock looks like a hold pending more information.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Apple and Tesla Are the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Trailing the S&amp;P 500 So Far This Year. Are They Worth Buying Now?",
        "content": "2023 was dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which drove the bulk of the S&P 500's total return last year. This year, it's more like the Fab Five.\n\nWhile Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and MetaPlatforms have all continued to outpace the market benchmark through the first half of the year, two members of the group have failed to keep pace. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares are up about 15% this year, trailing the S&P 500's 16% year-to-date return. Shares were down more than 10% at one point this year. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is still down about 1% for the year despite a recent surge in the share price.\n\nShould investors expect these two market leaders to return to their 2023 form or continue trailing the market? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's finally joining the AI trend\n\nWhile artificial intelligence drove the growth of most of the Magnificent Seven last year, Apple wasn't a big player in the space until recently. It announced its new \"Apple Intelligence\" features at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The new features include writing assistance, AI image generation and editing, and a much more advanced Siri. Apple also announced a system for integrating third-party large language models and applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT into iOS.\n\nThere are two potential catalysts from these new AI announcements. In the near term, Apple could see an increase in device upgrades. Apple Intelligence will be available only on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max as well as the forthcoming iPhone 16 lineup. The new software features could push more older iPhone users to upgrade their existing devices on a faster cadence.\n\nThe expectations for a strong upgrade cycle may be built into the stock at this point, after it rallied higher following Apple's announcements. Still, there's an opportunity for it to exceed expectations when it launches new iPhones in September.\n\nOver the long run, Apple's showed off the groundwork for running AI applications on iPhone. It could usher in a slew of AI-powered apps and demand for its Private Cloud Compute system for integrating complex queries to third-party services. That could be a boon to its services revenue, but it won't have much impact on the business this year.\n\nApple shares currently trade around 29.8 times forward earnings. While that's higher than the overall S&P 500 valuation, it's on the lower end of valuations among the Magnificent Seven. Apple arguably deserves a premium valuation as it produces tens of billions in free cash flow every quarter, sits on a significant sum of cash, and uses all of that cash to buy back a ton of its shares. That should help it produce strong EPS growth, especially if Apple Intelligence drives strong iPhone sales over the next year and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a slow start to 2024, Apple looks like a buy now.\n\nTesla needs to prove it's more than a car company\n\nTesla investors have been dealt several blows over the first half of the year as competition and macroeconomic challenges have weighed on Tesla's results.\n\nPricing pressure has been the biggest challenge for Tesla this year. Amid high interest rates and lower-cost competitors, Tesla has pushed price cuts to sell more vehicles. That's weighed on both sales and profit. The company reported its lowest quarterly sales since 2022 in the first quarter, down 8.5% year over year. Its profit shrank 55%.\n\nTesla improved in the second quarter. Sales reached 444,000 vehicles in the quarter, which is down about 5% year over year, but better than analysts were expecting. What's more, it produced just 411,000 vehicles, which suggests lower inventory and better free cash flow. Still, the sales drop probably means the company will report another drop in profits when it releases its second-quarter earnings results.\n\nTesla is aiming to correct course by bringing new affordable vehicles to market sooner than planned next year. The move could spur sales and shore up profit margin. But it's unlikely to play a significant role on the stock this year.\n\nThe biggest event aside from its monthly delivery numbers and quarterly earnings reports is an event in August, detailing Tesla's robotaxi plans. CEO Elon Musk has long promised fully autonomous vehicles and a fleet of robotaxis using its technology. So far, progress has been slower than promised. Several other companies are years ahead in the robotaxi business.\n\nTesla shares currently trade around 93 times forward earnings. That's an earnings multiple that's not even comparable to other car companies. Even if you expect strong delivery growth over the next few years as new affordable cars roll out, that price is hard to justify. Investors are expecting big things from the robotaxi event and the potential for the business going forward. An impressive presentation could send shares higher, but a disappointing outlook could result in more investors selling. At its current valuation, Tesla is too risky to recommend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 91%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "For the past 30 years, Wall Street and the investment community have been waiting for a game-changing innovation or technology to come along that can rival or surpass what the internet did for corporate America. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might fit the bill.\n\nWhen discussing AI, I'm loosely talking about using software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally be responsible for. What makes AI such a potential cornerstone innovation is the ability for software and systems to learn without human oversight. This ability to become more efficient at tasks over time, as well as learn new tasks, gives this technology utility in pretty much all facets of the U.S. and global economy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJust how big the AI revolution could be is left up to interpretation and the imagination. But according to the lofty estimates provided by analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence has the capacity to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. PwC came to this conclusion by deducing that $6.6 trillion would be added by increases in productivity, with the remaining $9.1 trillion aided by consumption-side benefits.\n\nDollar figures this large aren't lost on Wall Street's brightest minds. Most Wall Street institutions and analysts have set lofty growth expectations and sky-high price targets on market-leading AI stocks.\n\nBut there are exceptions.\n\nBased on the low-water price targets from select Wall Street analysts, the following three leading artificial intelligence stocks can plunge by up to 91%.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 65%\n\nThe first top-tier AI stock that might get taken to the woodshed, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nWhereas one analyst believes Palantir still offers 35% upside from where it closed on July 3, Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital believes it's worth $9 per share. If this forecast proves accurate, one of the hottest AI stocks would plummet by 65%!\n\nAlthough longtime Palantir bear Jaluria recognizes that its operating results have been solid, a May 2024 note implies concern about the company's commercial segment. Specifically, Jaluria points to revenue that's been pulled forward from special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that had signed deals with Palantir. There's no telling how sustainable or recurring this revenue will be.\n\nWhile Jaluria's concern is valid -- most SPACs have been disasters for investors -- Palantir does bring identifiable competitive advantages to the table that clearly do deserve some premium. For instance, the scope of services provided by Palantir can't be duplicated at scale by any other business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir's bread-and-butter operating segment has long been Gotham. This is the AI-driven platform that helps governments gather data and plan missions, among other tasks. The company typically secures multiyear contracts from governments using Gotham, which leads to sustained double-digit sales growth and predictable cash flow.\n\nHowever, the company's future likely rests with the success of its Foundry platform, the aforementioned \"commercial\" segment. Foundry is tasked with helping businesses understand their data so they can streamline their operations. Commercial customer count has surged 53% over the last year (as of March 31, 2024), albeit this segment is still in its very early stages of growth.\n\nAlthough Palantir can deliver sustained double-digit sales growth and is irreplaceable at scale, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 65 and a price-to-sales ratio of 25 (based on trailing-12-month sales), are tough pills to swallow in an already pricey stock market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 22%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that might face a coming beatdown is the company that's benefited most from the AI revolution: semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWhile most Wall Street analysts can't set their price targets high enough for this leading AI stock, Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymour set a $100 price target ($1,000 prior to Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split) in May. If Nvidia were to hit $100 per share, it would shed 22% of its current value, which translates to almost $700 billion in lost market cap.\n\nIn many ways, Nvidia's expansion has been flawless. The company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has quickly become the must-have chip for AI-accelerated data centers. Last year, Nvidia's GPUs accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped, according to TechInsights. With its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture set to make its debut in the latter half of this year, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble maintaining its compute advantage in enterprise data centers.\n\nHowever, history has consistently been a thorn in the side of businesses leading next-big-thing revolutions. Since the advent of the internet, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that's avoided a bubble in its early innings. Investors habitually overestimate the uptake and growth potential of new innovations and technologies while giving them no time to mature. Artificial intelligence seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter adjusted gross margin forecast of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) may also be an ominous warning. While an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% is still well above its historic norm, it represents a decline of 235 to 335 basis points from the sequential quarter. Putting two and two together, it suggests that competitive pressures have entered the picture.\n\nExternal competitors are releasing or ramping up production of their respective AI-GPUs in the second half of the year, while Nvidia's top four customers by net sales are all developing AI-accelerating chips of their own for their data centers. The GPU scarcity responsible for fueling Nvidia's scorching-hot adjusted gross margin looks set to wane -- and that's potentially bad news for investors.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 91%\n\nHowever, the potential disaster du jour among AI stocks is the world's most-valuable electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). The company's full self-driving (FSD) software, which uses a network of cameras and ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles, is a perfect example of how Tesla incorporates AI into its EVs.\n\nIn mid-April, longtime Tesla bear Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research lowered his uber-specific price target on Tesla to $22.86 per share. Historically, Johnson has arrived at his price targets by placing a multiple of 15 on his forward-year earnings estimate for the company and applying a 9% discount rate at the current price.\n\nThere's no denying that Tesla has done what had been impossible in the auto industry for more than a half-century. CEO Elon Musk successfully built the company from the ground up to mass production, and has delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. But the praise ends here.\n\nOver the last 18 months, Tesla has slashed the selling price for its fleet of EVs on more than a half-dozen occasions. With its first-mover advantages waning and competition picking up, Musk has had no choice but to become more price-competitive. The end result has been a steep reduction in the company's operating margin, a reversal to a free cash outflow during the first quarter, and a big increase in the company's EV inventory.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. Though it does have a handful of small victories under its belt, the growth rate for Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment has tapered significantly, while gross margin for Services is in the low single digits. As much as investors want to pretend that Tesla is an energy or tech company, the bulk of its sales and profits still come from its now-struggling and cyclical EV operations.\n\nThe other damning factor for Tesla is the laundry list of promises and innovations from Musk that have failed to take shape. After a full decade of promising Level 5 autonomy for his company's EVs, Tesla's FSD hasn't budged from Level 2 autonomy. What's more, the Cybertruck has been an early stage flop, with multiple recalls and subpar deliveries.\n\nTesla is an auto stock with contracting margins and declining EV deliveries that's trading at a premium to even the loftiest of AI stocks. While a 91% drop might be a bit extreme, I'd have to concur with Gordon Johnson that significant downside seems likely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Robotics is the core of automation in a variety of business sectors. In this day and age, with the demand for and proliferation of artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based technologies, the robotics sector could experience a real boom. Nowadays, investing in robotics stocks could make a great investment, especially considering how well the Nasdaq Composite has performed. The tech-heavy index has rallied 18.9% on a year-to-date basis, and everything related to automation and AI could keep the index rising even higher. Better-than-expected inflation data has also sparked markets into a rally. If the economic data improves, investors will be betting on one or more rate cuts by the end of the year, which could also improve equities prospects.\n\nHowever, it is important to distinguish between potentially high-performing robotics stocks and those that investors ought to avoid. In this article, we will discuss three robotics stocks likely to crash and burn as we approach July.\n\nHere are the robotics stocks to sell:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRobotics Stocks to Sell: iRobot (IRBT) Tariffs Won't Kill iRobot, but IRBT Stock Is About to Get Cheap\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFounded in 1990 by MIT roboticists, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is a designer and manufacturer of consumer-focused robots. The firm is particularly renowned for its Roomba series of robotic vacuum cleaners, which have helped automate certain home cleaning aspects with advanced technology and user-friendly features. iRobot\u2019s product portfolio does not stop there. The company also provides the Braava line of mopping robots.\n\nUnfortunately for iRobot, high inflation, elevated interest rates, and waning consumer confidence have severely dented the consumer robotics firm\u2019s sales growth. IRobot\u2019s sales have been in decline since 2022. Because of iRobot\u2019s declining prospects, the company has pursued a restructuring plan, but even after implementing a quarter of cost-cutting initiatives, the robotics firm delivered mixed results in the first quarter of 2024.\n\niRobot\u2019s shares have collapsed more than 77% in 2024, and a further plunge is possible, especially as the business continues to deliver underwhelming financial results amidst its restructuring period.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NASDAQ:MDT) manufactures and sells a variety of medical devices to healthcare facilities and clinics. The medical device manufacturer\u2019s robotics portfolio is centered around the Hugo Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS) system, which offers a modular design, advanced 3D visualization, and data integration for enhanced surgical precision. Complementing Hugo is the Touch Surgery Enterprise, a cloud-based video capture and analytics platform that effectively aids in the surgical review process. Medtronic\u2019s ongoing R&D efforts aim to refine these technologies with AI and machine learning integrations to improve surgical outcomes further.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, R&D investments have recently led to compressing margins and falling earnings. In particular, Medtronic\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings results for fiscal year 2024 showed non-GAAP earnings per share at $1.46, below $1.57 for the same period a year prior.\n\nEquities traders and investors will likely scrutinize the earnings of companies trying to enter the AI space, and declining margins are never a good sign. MDT shares have fallen more than 4% for the year.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) provides numerous industrial automation solutions to clients. The last time I wrote about Rockwell in mid-May, its shares had declined 11.1% for the year. In July, the industrial automation firm\u2019s share price has now slipped 13.9% on a year-to-date basis. In particular, I noted how Rockwell\u2019s sales for automotive solutions declined in the \u201chigh single digits\u201d for their first-quarter earnings of fiscal year 2024. This decline was related to ongoing headwinds facing the electric vehicle (EV) market. Those headwinds have not abated for certain EV makers. For example, Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) factory output in Shanghai remains dismal, potentially pointing to more pressure for Rockwell\u2019s automotive business going forward.\n\nGrowing pessimism about the U.S. industrial base has led to several stock price downgrades from brokers. Underscoring those sentiments, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and banks have all adjusted their price targets for ROK downward in recent weeks. Thus, I think it is one of the robotics stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s patriotic Fourth of July video Thursday drew praise from fans of his unexpectedly fruitful rebrand, but it fell flat with his archrival: billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThe video shows long-haired Zuckerberg sporting an elegant tuxedo and sipping a beer while flaunting an American flag on his beloved hydrofoil, a board that uses a wing below the water to keep afloat. The video, set to Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\u201d with the caption \u201cHappy birthday, America!,\u201d quickly went viral, garnering more than 700,000 likes and millions of views.\n\nThe video is part of a rebrand that has transformed Zuck from computer nerd to billionaire bad boy. In 2020, the Meta CEO was photographed on a board similar to the one in the Thursday video and was lambasted for his blue hoodie, shorts, and sunscreen-slathered face.\n\nBut the new and improved Zuck, who wears designer clothes and wins MMA bouts, managed to pull off the look this year, drawing virtual applause from fans for his \u201cbased\u201d show of patriotism.\n\nStill, at least one influential voice bashed Zuckerberg for the video: his nemesis, Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cMay he continue to have fun on his yachts. I prefer to work,\u201d Musk said in a post on X.\n\nMusk supporter Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports also jumped in, saying on X that \u201cZuck will always be uncool.\u201d\n\nMusk often ruffles feathers with his fellow billionaires, but he and Zuck have escalated their feud as of late. Their conflict, which possibly started over a blown-up satellite, came to a head last year when Musk challenged Zuck to a \u201ccage match,\u201d which the Meta CEO later canceled because he said Musk wouldn\u2019t confirm a date. A month later, Zuckerberg launched Threads, a direct competitor to Musk\u2019s X.\n\nMusk still hasn\u2019t forgotten about the canceled cage match and brought it up again in a post on the day after Zuckerberg\u2019s 40th birthday.\n\n\"If only Zuckerberg were as tough (sigh). I've offered to fight him any place, any time, any rules, but all I hear is crickets,\" Musk posted on X on May 15.\n\nIn April, the two finally fought it out but in a battle of riches, with Zuckerberg passing the Tesla CEO to become the third-richest person in the world. But since then, Tesla\u2019s stock has rallied and investors have approved Musk\u2019s record-breaking $45 billion pay package, helping him once again reclaim the title of world\u2019s richest man, leaving Zuck in the dust. Musk has a net worth of $252 billion compared to Zuck\u2019s $181 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Stocks are at record highs. Investors keep playing the hits.",
        "content": "Stocks are trading at record highs, and the market's main characters haven't changed.\n\nYahoo Finance's data whiz Jared Blikre flagged the stocks making new intraday record highs alongside the index on Friday. The names are a who's who of market leaders with only one exception \u2014 Nvidia stock (NVDA) was down after receiving a downgrade from New Street Research.\n\nApple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Costco (COST), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), on the other hand, all saw their stocks trade at intraday records on Friday.\n\nInvestors can maybe point to the soft jobs report and the prospect of lower interest rates as a catalyst for the move. At least for a chunk of these winners.\n\nTech was the biggest winner of low-interest-rate environments over the last decade, and the so-called hyperscalers in the AI race \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet among them \u2014 are set to be the arms dealers should another speculative investment boom break out.\n\nBut on Wall Street, it appears that spending too much time in this market teasing out the fundamental particularities of why the same group of market leaders continues to lead the market is no longer a worthwhile exercise.\n\nTo wit: Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz on Wednesday dropped coverage of the S&P 500, writing that, \"Talking about the S&P 500 to communicate investment insights to institutional investors has become an exercise in futility.\"\n\nThe 10 biggest stocks in the index account for almost 40% of the index's market cap, Kantrowitz noted. And both the index's returns and earnings growth are being driven by this small handful of companies.\n\nRather than reflecting a broad swath of the corporate world's fortunes, then, the so-called benchmark stock index has become captive to the AI trade. For some, this is not a flaw of the index, but a feature, as argued by strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute last week.\n\nSure, the S&P 500 may seem to tip out of balance, reflecting the fortunes of a privileged few over the more measured progress (or struggles) of the quieter majority. But the concept of an index is that investors can capture the market return in whatever form that takes.\n\nThis dynamic often benefits the DIY investor class looking for cheap exposure to \"the market,\" but it is a thorn in the side of portfolio managers who charge institutions more for their services as they seek to best the returns available to the masses.\n\nSaid another way, what institutional investors seek are returns \u2014 preferably returns that beat the market, of course \u2014 but most importantly, returns that do not come in whatever form the market takes. For big-money investors, safety is often paramount. And AI hype minting new multi-trillion dollar winners each week doesn't exactly scream safe by this measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in 2020, before the pandemic turned markets upside down, we talked to Tom Lee at Fundstrat who saw the rally in Tesla (TSLA) stock that year as a sign of investors chasing their benchmark. Tesla stock, at the time, was responsible for a large chunk of the gains in the Russell 1000 Growth index (VONG), an index favored as the benchmark by many of Fundstrat's clients at the time.\n\nIn an effort to make up this gap, clients had a simple card to play: buy Tesla.\n\nFriday's market action \u2014 and much of what has been seen in stocks since May \u2014 seems reminiscent.\n\nBecause if the benchmark index is no longer a useful benchmark, a portfolio manager has a (seemingly) simple choice to make: either buy more of the stocks leading your benchmark, or find another way to explain your performance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Ask five analysts their perspective on a stock like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and you\u2019ll likely find five different answers. Look to the massive gap between Cathie Wood\u2019s $2,600 Tesla price target and Pr Lekander\u2019s $14 per-share pricing prediction for evidence of the wide disparity among analysts, even among popular and well-liked stocks. Analysts aren\u2019t always spot-on with their forecasts or predictions. However, when stocks with negative analyst sentiment overwhelmingly swings toward the bearish side of the spectrum with limited upside presented, investors should pay attention.\n\nSuppose a stock smells rotten, and analysts consistently agree that it stinks. In that case, there\u2019s likely something wrong with it \u2014 while contrarian investing has its place, moving against the tide can be devastating.\n\nThese three stocks with negative analyst sentiment have an overwhelmingly bearish consensus and, therefore, aren\u2019t worth buying today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt likely isn\u2019t surprising that GameStop (NYSE:GME) tops the list of stocks with negative analyst sentiments. With the overwhelming majority of analysts saying that GameStop is a screaming sell, it seems the only bulls remaining in GameStop\u2019s corner are the legions of bagholders continually drawn in by empty promises of a short squeeze long past overdue.\n\nAnalyst consensus pegs GameStop\u2019s fair value at about $11 per share or more than half of today\u2019s trade price. Meme stock status aside, the reasons are apparent. Quarterly sales for 2024\u2019s first quarter failed to break the $1 billion mark, dropping nearly 30% on a year-over-year basis. GameStop improved its profitability prospects by $18.2 million to hit a net loss of $32.3 million. But, far from operational improvements, the narrower net loss is largely attributable to slashing SG&A expenses \u2014 which primarily came from sweeping layoffs.\n\nWedbush analysts are particularly bearish on GameStop, saying that the company has perhaps five years of cash available if current sales trends continue without a rapid turnaround.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nLike GameStop, it isn\u2019t surprising that Boeing (NYSE:BA) is one of today\u2019s top stocks with negative analyst sentiment. By now, we\u2019re all too familiar with the multitude of aircraft and performance problems that sent shares tumbling 25% since January and keep the stock trading well below pre-pandemic levels. Worse yet, the problems are systemic and not likely correctable within a reasonable timeframe to pull it from the depths of stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, Boeing\u2019s problems stem from managerial decisions emphasizing financial tricks and bean counting over mechanical engineering and safety. One reporter summed the situation up succinctly: \u201cBoeing, like many, many publicly traded companies in the country, put a premium on satisfying its shareholders\u201d and that \u201cthe results of that at the end of the day were inferior checks and balances inside the company, a culture that promoted short-term profitability over long-term quality.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a lack of foresight and emphasis on long-term sustainability may be the final nail in Boeing\u2019s coffin and a definitive contributor to its status among stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) once appeared promising given the rise of remote learning platforms, but increased bearish sentiment situates it within the stocks with a negative analyst sentiment camp. In an era overflowing with free educational resources, getting customers to pay for courses they can easily access on platforms like YouTube or find in books is a tough challenge. Although Udemy boasts high-profile corporate clients such as AT&T (NYSE:T), larger companies are increasingly developing their own internal training programs, reducing the need for Udemy\u2019s offerings.\n\nUdemy\u2019s customer retention numbers highlight this misalignment. While the company reported a 12% increase in total customers and a 21% rise in recurring revenue last quarter, a deeper dive into the numbers reveals a troubling trend.\n\nUdemy experienced an 8% decline in net dollar retention, indicating a drop in how long customers stay with the service. More worrying is the 9% drop in large customer net dollar retention, which includes companies with over 1,000 employees. These figures suggest that companies aren\u2019t sticking with Udemy for the long haul once they fulfill their immediate needs.\n\nIn the fiercely competitive EdTech market, Udemy\u2019s difficulty in retaining customers and setting itself apart is a significant concern, making it clear why it\u2019s situated among other stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "'Can't Possibly Think of Genes I Would Prefer More' \u2014 Elon Musk, Father of 12, Swayed His Neuralink Executive To Have Kids With Him Over A Donor",
        "content": "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and CEO of Tesla, is known for his ambitious plans to colonize Mars. However, he\u2019s also focused on addressing the underpopulation crisis. Musk, a father of 12, recently welcomed his third child with Shivon Zilis, the director of special projects at Neuralink Corp. Musk and Zilis already have twins, Strider and Azure, born in November 2021.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nShivon Zilis, a key executive at Neuralink\u00a0 \u2014 a company Musk cofounded \u2014 shared insights into their unique arrangement. Initially contemplating sperm donation, Musk persuaded Zilis to choose him as the donor.\n\nIn his 2023 biography, Elon Musk is quoted as saying, \"He really wants smart people to have kids, so he encouraged me to,\" Zilis said. \"If the choice is between an anonymous donor or doing it with the person you admire most in the world, for me it was a pretty f***ing easy decision.\" She added, \"I can't possibly think of genes I would prefer more for my children.\"\n\nWalter Isaacson's biography of Musk details his rationale for having multiple children with different women, emphasizing the need for intelligent people to procreate. Zilis also mentioned that this arrangement made Musk \"very, very happy.\" Initially expecting Musk to take on a more distant role, Zilis noted that he had been actively involved in their twins\u2019 lives.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nDespite not being romantically involved, their decision to have children together aligns with Musk's concerns about the decline of the global population. Musk has frequently voiced the importance of reversing this trend among highly intelligent people, seeing it as crucial for civilization's survival. In July 2022, Musk tweeted, \"Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. A collapsing birthrate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.\"\n\nThe latest addition to Musk\u2019s family continues his pattern of fathering children with multiple partners. He has six children with Canadian author Justine Wilson, whom he married from 2000 to 2008. Their first child, Nevada, tragically died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in 2002. The couple also has twins \u2014 Griffin and Vivian, born in 2004, and triplets \u2014 Kai, Saxon, and Damian, born in 2006.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Want to invest in homes? $10 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nIn 2020, Canadian musician Grimes gave birth to Musk\u2019s son, X \u00c6 A-12. The following year, they welcomed a daughter, Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l, also known as Y, and another child, Techno Mechanicus, in 2023. Grimes has recently sued Musk over parental rights, claiming he hasn\u2019t allowed her to see one of their sons. The custody battle is ongoing.\n\nMusk's emphasis on addressing the underpopulation crisis is clear. \"Many countries are already well below replacement rate, and the trend is that almost all will be,\" Musk told Page Six. \"This is simply a fact, not a \u2018debunked theory.' 2.1 kids is the replacement rate, and obviously the world as a whole will soon drop below that point.\"\n\nBirthrates in many developed countries, including Canada, have declined near to or below the 2.1 replacement rate. Various factors contribute to this decline, including a lack of affordable housing, financial insecurity, and increased acceptance of not having children. According to the Organization for Economic cooperation and Development (OECD), this trend can significantly impact a nation's economic growth and prosperity.\n\nMusk, whose net worth is estimated at $221 billion according to Forbes, continues to make headlines not only for his technological ventures but also for his growing family and outspoken views on population trends.\n\nThis story was previously published on Benzinga and has been updated.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "title": "Tesla\u2019s Q2 powered it to a monster rally this week, but not everything is rosy when peering under the hood",
        "content": "They say don\u2019t tempt the fates, but Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla may be on a roll.\n\nOn Friday, shares in his EV manufacturer cracked the $252 mark, a height it hasn\u2019t seen since December, after revealing on Tuesday only a mild drop in second-quarter vehicle sales that beat analyst estimates.\n\nAhead of its autonomous CyberCab robotaxi unveiling in five weeks, Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities is now calling the company the most undervalued AI play in the market.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that Tesla is more of an AI and robotics play than a traditional car company,\u201d he told investors on Friday, adding that \u201cthe rubber meets the road as the Street anticipates August 8th as a linchpin day for the Tesla story.\u201d\n\nBut before excitement gets too out of hand it\u2019s worth casting a deeper look at the sales figures that played such a key role in this week\u2019s monster 25% rally, which added over $150 billion in market cap and erased all year-to-date losses. And not everything looks rosy under the hood.\n\nFirst off, Q2 was effectively a freebie for Musk ever since Tesla announced in April it was accelerating the launch plan of new models from their previous mid-2025 timetable.\n\nIf the company whiffed on expectations, investors could justifiably argue it doesn\u2019t matter since the arrival of fresh new product is only months away. If volumes matched or exceeded consensus, it would show Tesla remains the dominant EV brand in the world even without them.\n\nIn other words, heads bulls win, tails bears lose.\n\nNo, I'm not worried. This is a suckers rally and it's overbought. Auto numbers were good but not good enough for 30% rally. Plus, $TSLA doesn't want to be an auto company so the rally on autos is kind of ironic and comical. It's deserved on finally hitting deliveries but they\u2026\n\n\u2014 squawksquare (@squawksquare) July 3, 2024\n\nRare upside surprise\n\nAnalysts who repeatedly update their forecasts had estimated sales of around 425,000 vehicles, a steep 9% drop over the previous year\u2019s level. Instead, Tesla delivered 444,000.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual since Tesla\u2014being worth more than the next eight largest carmakers put together\u2014is scrutinized by\u00a0a small army of investors, complete with accounts that track container ships full of Teslas departing from Shanghai\u2019s port to those that operate drone fly-overs around its Texas manufacturing plant.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, forecasters only have to follow the mid-size segment since 95% of its volume comes from either the Model Y crossover or its sibling Model 3 sedan that share many of the same parts to reduce costs.\n\nMoreover, there is data coming out of China every week, and even Europe\u2019s 30-odd markets provide a monthly update on Tesla sales. In theory, Tesla shouldn\u2019t be capable of a big surprise so long as its build rate matches customer orders.\n\nWhy is this necessarily a cause for caution?\n\nIn recent quarters, however, the gap between production and sales has widened with Tesla building 46,500 more cars than it delivered in the first three months of this year. While this generates the growth investors demand, it consumes precious resources.\n\nAnalysts had worried this might continue since a car model\u2019s sales tend to only go in one gradual direction\u2014down. As it ages, it typically finds it harder to compete in the market against newer rivals, not easier.\n\nThat helps explain why Q2 production hit its lowest three-month figure since Q3 of 2022. Throttling output to 410,000 is a clear reaction to demand weakening, especially since the first three months of 2024 already saw interruptions in production due to a model changeover in Fremont, Calif., and an arson attack on its Berlin plant.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla offered Americans a teaser rate of 0.99% in May for customers looking to finance the purchase of a vehicle. That offer has since expired, however.\n\n\u201cThere is a potential that some of the tricks that were deployed in Q2 to pump these delivery figures\u2014specifically some of those interest rate offers\u2014are now no longer available at all, which makes me think that there was a little bit of a desire to really solidify a bottom,\u201d Tesla bull Kevin Paffrath, who manages the Pricing Power ETF,\u00a0told his 2 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nOr take Europe, where data published on Friday suggested June was the carmaker\u2019s best month so far this year as customers rushed to lock in lower prices ahead of punitive EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs that took effect this week. Either Tesla pays the tariff itself, or it will be under pressure to sell even more in China to offset the loss.\n\nThis could result in third-quarter weakness.\n\nWhat does this mean for Q2 earnings?\n\nTesla is due to report preliminary figures on July 23, and here things ought to look rosy in part because Tesla has reduced headcount so heavily in recent months.\n\nMore Q2 deliveries than expected also means more revenue recognition and thus more earnings, so analysts will likely be raising their estimates for the quarter and with it the year.\n\nMoreover, Tesla deployed more than twice as many stationary commercial batteries over the first quarter, so its contribution could mean an extra $400 million in quarterly gross profit.\n\nThen there\u2019s its finances. By liquidating inventory, Tesla releases much needed cash: last quarter saw it burn through $2.5 billion, the first draw down since the COVID pandemic erupted in Q1 of 2020.\n\nAnd this boost could prove a big help. Assuming the average transaction price per car remains flat at $45,000, the 33,000 unit drawdown from its stock of unsold cars adds an extra $1.5 billion in cold hard cash in the till.\n\nThe question is what kind of incentive did Tesla have to offer to move that metal off its lots, which would dilute its profitability. In the past, investors have focused more on its automotive gross margins than its absolute earnings as a metric for sentiment in the stock.\n\n\u201cDiscounting, discounting, discounting,\u201d says Matthias Schmidt, an independent industry analyst in Germany who specializes in the EV market. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate to keep their growth narrative on track because any indication it\u2019s coming to an end will impact their stock price.\u201d\n\nWhat's next?\n\nJuly 23 is just the warm-up. The main event is on Aug. 8, when Tesla is scheduled to reveal its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi model expected to lack a steering wheel and pedals.\n\nInvestors will be keen to know specifics on when and how it might be rolled out, since JPMorgan learned last month it might not be ready for production\u00a0until 2027 based on conversations it held with the company.\n\nAs a result, Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas says he will be focusing in on any data points Tesla may provide in its Q2 earnings report as regards to the Full Self-Driving (FSD) take-rate after their recent free trial.\n\n\u201cIt will be really important to see how many people opted in and bought that software this quarter. That is the key to the near-term story,\u201d he told CNBC this week.\n\nJust as importantly, Tesla is expected to have more than one surprise in tow that day. It announced in April plans to accelerate the launch of new models, including more affordable ones, that need not require new factories. As a result, all talk of constructing a Giga Mexico plant in Nuevo Leon has vanished, let alone negotiating a new one to be located in India.\n\nShould it fail to show up with at least one new vehicle ready to launch by the start of next year, investors might once again worry how Tesla will lift its total annual sales volumes of around 1.8 million vehicles to match its current capacity of nearly 3 million.\n\nIronically, even though Musk wants to rebrand Tesla as an AI and robotics company, it still has to earn a living selling cars for now and this week's market rally was the best proof of that.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- The S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday on bets that Federal Reserve rate rate cuts may soon be on the horizon after the June monthly jobs report pointing to cooling in the labor market.\n\nAt 15:43 ET (19:53 GMT), the S&P 500 gained 0.5% to a record high of 5,566.75 , the NASDAQ Composite climbed 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 68 points.\n\nTreasury yields nosedive after payrolls point to cooling labor market\n\nTreasury yields came under pressure after the monthly jobs report for June showed the economy added 206,000 jobs last month, down from 218,000 in May, but the solid headline payrolls number was accompanied by \"sizeable downward revisions,\" Macquarie said, as jobs gains for the May and April were revised lower. Adding to signs of cooling labor market the the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, from 4.0% in May, average hourly wage growth slowed, strengthening the case for a September rate cut.\n\n\"While for now our base case for a first cut remains December, it has become increasingly likely that one may occur earlier than this, with a reduction at the September meeting a strong possibility,\" Macquarie added.\n\nTraders now see a 70% of a rate cut in September, down from 60% in the prior week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Too.\n\nThis cooling in the jobs market through June also comes after a series of weaker-than-expected labor market readings this week.\n\nMeta hits all time highs as tech adds to gians; Nvidia stumbles on downgrade, Tesla in China win\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) led the rise in big tech as the social media company soared more than 4% to hit record highs earlier in the day, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also higher.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down 2%, failed to partake in the broader market rally after New Street Research downgraded the stock to hold from buy, citing concerns about valuations.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock added 2% on reports that several state-owned firms in China's financial hub of Shanghai have recently purchased the EV manufacturer's best-selling Model Y as service cars after Tesla cars reportedly were added to the list Chinese local government purchase list.\n\nMacy's in fresh deal fever; Chinese EV stocks hit by new EU tarrifs\n\nMacy\u2019s (NYSE:M) stock rose over 9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management have raised their bid to buy the department store chain for about $6.9 billion.\n\nChinese EV stocks including Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), Nio Inc Class A ADR (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) were sharplly lower after the European Union proposed increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China commended on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto stocks recover ground as Bitcoin pares some losses amid Mt.

Earlier this week, the rally was boosted further after the company reported deliveries for the second quarter that beat the average analyst estimate.\n\nWhile analysts were positive about those stronger-than-expected deliveries, they marked the auto maker\u2019s first consecutive quarterly decline for deliveries for more than a decade. The carmaker on Tuesday said it delivered 443,956 vehicles in the second quarter, exceeding the average of 439,302 that analysts on Wall Street had estimated, but falling compared with prior quarters.\n\n\u201cThe worst is in the rear-view mirror for Tesla,\u201d Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a Friday note. \u201cVery importantly, it appears China saw a \u2018mini rebound\u2019 in the June quarter.\u201d\n\nA Chinese government statement said a number of state-owned companies in Shanghai have bought Tesla\u2019s Model Y for business use. However, heightened competition in the country has kindled price wars and demand worries for the EV maker this year.\n\nTesla has had a tough year as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced major staff reductions in April, followed by additional cuts of as much as 20%.\n\nTesla shares, which had been trading within a pretty tight range since early May, have finally broken out. The stock has blown past its 200-day moving average \u2014 a longer-term trend indicator that traders pay close attention to.\n\nTo be sure, there is at least one technical measure suggesting a pullback might be around the corner. The rally has propelled the stock\u2019s relative strength index, a gauge of bullish and bearish price momentum ranging from zero to 100, above 80 in recent days.\n\nTesla shares swung between gains and losses on Friday, trading about 0.9% higher at 10:05 am in New York after falling as much as 1.6%.\n\nSuch an elevated RSI level is generally viewed as a signal that a decline is imminent, as buying has gotten excessive.\n\n(Updates throughout to reflect stock move.)\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

(CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nTesla has faced stiff competition abroad from its Chinese counterparts and some waning demand for EVs in the US. In an effort to reduce costs, the company embarked on a plan to cut more than 10% of its global staff earlier this year in what some analysts saw as a signal of tough times ahead.\n\nThe company also slashed prices last year to spur sales.\n\nDuring Tesla's shareholder meeting last month, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that near-term demand and sales would still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period.\n\n\"There is still the risk of further price cuts ahead, and there [are] still further questions on fundamentals, we are still facing somewhat of an EV winter on demand,\" Barclays senior equity research analyst Dan Levy told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. \"So, good result.

        "content": "Nvidia downgraded, Tesla upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop Calls:\n\nNew Street downgraded Nvidia (NVDA) to Neutral from Buy with a one-year price target of $135. The firm says the shares are \"getting fully valued for the base case.\" Share upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and New Street does not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the \"quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact,\" and it would be buyers again of Nvidia, \"but only on prolonged weakness.\" Among the artificial intelligence stocks, New Street views AMD (AMD) and TSMC (TSM) as the most attractive, the firm noted. China Renaissance upgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $282.13, up from $151.31. The analyst increased estimates to reflect the \"substantial expansion\" of Tesla's energy storage business in Q2. The firm sees \"re-rating opportunities\" for the shares from an improving electric vehicle business and new products from Full-Self Driving, Robotaxi, and the company's robot segments. Raymond James downgraded Spirit Airlines (SAVE) to Underperform, a sell-equivalent rating, from Market Perform without a price target. The downgrade reflects a slightly lower fuel outlook and weaker fare trends, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the budget airline setup into Q3 is \"clear as mud\" given the \"rapid market and product modifications and potential headwinds. The risks are greatest at Frontier and Spirit despite the \"already weak share price and investor sentiment,\" adds Raymond James. The firm does not believe a bankruptcy filing is a foregone conclusion for Spirit, and says the GTF engine compensation has been good. However, it does not fully offset the earnings impacts from aircraft on ground, which is a materially greater issue for Spirit than any other U.S. airline and expected to get worse in 2025, the firm adds. Raymond James downgraded Frontier Group (ULCC) to Underperform from Market Perform without a price target. The downgrade reflects a slightly lower fuel outlook and weaker fare trends, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the budget airline setup into Q3 is \"clear as mud\" given the \"rapid market and product modifications\" and potential headwinds. The risks are greatest at Frontier and Spirit despite the \"already weak share price and investor sentiment,\" adds Raymond James. The firm says that despite network changes to improve operations, Frontier's completion factor lags that of most U.S. peers both on an absolute and year-over-year basis. Raymond views the airline's adjustments to August schedules as a \"Band-Aid\" to its longer-term concerns around Frontier's planned growth with 240-seat A321s. Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Lloyds Banking (LYG) to Outperform from Neutral with a 72 GBp price target. The analyst replaced NatWest Group (NWG) with Lloyds as the firm's top pick in UK banks. Confirmation of a Labour party majority add visibility for equity investors, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the banks will largely stay out of the political headlines in the coming weeks, which is welcome. The focus can now shift back to improving operating trends, according to Exane.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett took a cue from a classic Western film last year when he expanded on the idea of the FAANG stocks, dubbing his new set of the most important companies on Wall Street the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These commanding megacaps are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll of them remain dominant forces in today's market -- other than Tesla, which is struggling with slowing EV sales. Two of them in particular look like top-tier buys preparing to crush the market right now: Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nGenerative AI is a new tool for each company\n\nWhile both Alphabet and Meta are involved in artificial intelligence (AI), their businesses are far more diverse than that. AI may grab headlines, but the bigger business for both companies is the advertisements they serve up along with the content and search results their users are after.\n\nIn Q1, 77% of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising-related sources. For Meta, an incredible 98% came from ad revenue. This makes the advertising market a key factor in both stocks' investment cases.\n\nFurthermore, each is developing AI technologies to stay at the top of their game. In both cases, that means using generative AI models they have developed in-house to aid advertisers. For example, advertisers on Meta can use its tools to create multiple iterations of the same ad nearly instantly, which allows them to tailor their ads to their viewers. Alphabet offers tools that help advertisers quickly create campaigns that meet all of its internal guidelines. These examples show how each company is trying to stay ahead of its rivals by integrating new AI technologies as quickly as possible.\n\nThese innovations may (or may not) bring any new revenue, as the AI upgrades are essentially required for them to stay at the top of their respective industries. However, each company is doing so well right now that new revenue from new technologies isn't necessarily required for them to excel.\n\nGrowth for each business is strong\n\nIn Q1, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 13% to $61.7 billion. In particular, YouTube excelled, with revenue rising 21% to $8.1 billion. While most of Alphabet's advertising empire is fairly mature, YouTube is still growing quickly. Still, 13% growth companywide is impressive, considering the maturity of the business.\n\nMeta's growth put Alphabet's to shame. In Q1, its ad revenue grew 27% to $35.6 billion. And its revenue increased at a healthy pace in all of its regions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese strong results aren't outliers, either. Wall Street analysts project Alphabet's revenue will rise 13% this year and 11% next year. For Meta, Wall Street expects 18% and 13% growth. Both of these are strong projections (considering the companies' size) and are great reasons to invest.\n\nHowever, the last point is just icing on the cake.\n\nYou don't have to pay a fortune to own either stock\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the Magnificent Seven\u00a0 -- Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla -- every one of them is expensive from a valuation standpoint. Measured by their forward price-to-earnings ratios (which consider earnings projections over the next 12 months), none trades lower than 30.\n\nThat's a historically expensive price to pay, which should give investors pause. However, Alphabet and Meta don't command premiums quite that high. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 24 and 25 times forward earnings, both still command slight premiums to the broader market's average of 22.3 (using the S&P 500 as a benchmark). However, their execution and market dominance justify those slight premiums.\n\nWith both companies excelling, projected to grow at respectable paces, and trading at reasonable valuations, they easily top my list as the best stocks to buy in the Magnificent Seven now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Tesla bulls ride again: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIf Tesla (TSLA) can be a tech company when car sales falter, surely it can be a car company when sales exceed expectations. That\u2019s how Wall Street sees it, as Tesla bulls are once again ascendant.\n\nOver the last week, Tesla shares have surged more than 25%, boosted by vehicle deliveries that beat estimates, leaving the paltry gains of the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" in the dust.\n\nWhen CEO Elon Musk insisted earlier this year that Tesla isn\u2019t a car company, the message jolted the stock price even as sales faltered. While convenient, the pitch was true enough. And the edict apparently goes both ways.\n\nThe stock surge speaks to the power of touting an industry-leading product \u2014 a lesson for AI startups \u2014 and the benefit of making AI ambitions a part of a broader business plan, rather than the sole aspect of it. But conversely, it underscores that Tesla\u2019s heady AI goals are still closely tethered to its car sales.\n\nCombining lofty techno-ambitions with moving cars off lots has been key to Musk\u2019s salesmanship.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, the worst is in the rear-view mirror for Tesla as we believe the EV demand story is starting to return to the disruptive tech stalwart,\u201d outspoken Tesla backer Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities wrote in a note earlier this week.\n\nThe upbeat delivery data counters a wave of negative sentiment.\n\nDriven by stiffening competition in China, softening demand at home, price cuts, layoffs, and Musk\u2019s legal and corporate dramas, Tesla had limped along as a Magnificent Seven laggard. But recent wins have a way of erasing earlier losses. And Tesla is now riding a string of victories, with an earnings report and a much-hyped robotaxi unveiling just around the corner.\n\nInvestors are buying into the shifting mood. Since a low in late April, Tesla is up more than 60%.\n\nBut even some Tesla backers are poking holes in the latest rally. It\u2019s true Tesla beat expectations, but sales fell from the same period last year. And how have more aggressive rivals and cheaper prices eaten into profitability?\n\n\u201cIn reality Tesla EV sales were down 5% and the company seems to be capitulating to the idea of selling EVs. It\u2019s all about FSD and taxis now,\u201d said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, referring to Full Self-Driving.\n\nIn some ways, Tesla\u2019s flexible identity as a car company when times are good and a tech company when the chips are down can be a hindrance to a clear corporate strategy. Is Tesla still gunning for a mass-market EV in every family\u2019s driveway? Or is it a platform orchestrating a fleet of autonomous taxis expanding the frontier of AI technology?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt can be both, of course. And Musk is prone to wanting it all. Investors don\u2019t seem to mind which metaphorical cap the company is wearing on any particular day. Just as long as the numbers go up. AI can make that happen. And, for now, so can cars.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Tesla showcased its humanoid robot, the second-generation Optimus, at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Thursday, making it one of the few American AI products seen at China's top AI show.\n\nThe Optimus humanoid robot, equipped with Tesla's self-developed neural network and computer vision technology, is largely seen as the future of robots as it is able to handle multiple tasks.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said at the company's annual shareholder's meeting that the humanoid robot, which has yet to enter full-scale production, could lift Tesla's market cap to US$25 trillion in the future.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe single Optimus shown at the Shanghai event attracted a lot of attention, even though it was behind glass, and did not move or interact with visitors. Tesla, meanwhile, promoted the humanoid robot on Chinese social media Weibo, asking the public to \"witness the further evolution of humanoid robots\".\n\nA number of Chinese robotic companies brought their products to the show, as alternatives to Optimus. Local exhibitors, including Shanghai-based Fourier, Tlibot, Dataa Robotics, Robotera, Leju Robot, Shanghai Kepler Robot and Ti5 Robot, took to the centre stage to display their humanoid robots for visitors.\n\nTesla's humanoid robot Optimus. Photo: Che Pan alt=Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus. Photo: Che Pan>\n\nA total of 18 robots, including \"Healthy Loong\" developed by Humanoid Robots (Shanghai), were presented at the event.\n\nAlthough humanoid robots have started to be used in China in sectors including education, entertainment, healthcare, elder care, and factory manufacturing, they are still in the lab research stage, according to representatives from the companies, and are not generating sales yet.\n\nDespite being hyped as one of the most promising applications in the era of AI, the high costs of humanoid robots prevent them from being deployed on a large scale, according to an engineer at Tlibot, a company founded in 2012 in Mianyang, Sichuan province.\n\nThe engineer said a humanoid robot could cost between 500,000 yuan (US$70,000) and 1 million yuan, depending on the complexity of its functions. In comparison, Tesla's Optimus is expected to sell for up to US$30,000.\n\nLeju Robot showed its Kuavo robot powered by Kaihong OS, an operating system derived from Huawei's OpenHarmony, an open-source OS for smart devices. Wu Changxuan, an engineer with Leju Robot, said that developing software systems for humanoid robots is more challenging than the hardware, as the company explores ways of widening its applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina aims to achieve mass production of humanoid robots by 2025, according to a guideline published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Tesla, Inc. TSLA and Natural Health Trends Corp. NHTC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Meta Platforms and Tesla\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Tesla, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple\u2019s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nAI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company\u2019s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Natural Health Trends have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+25.6% vs. -10.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $79.12 million shows a promising uptick, with an 11% quarterly order rise and a 1% annual increase, suggesting a market and operational recovery.\r\n\r\nDespite a slight revenue drop, cash flow remains positive, supported by prudent financial strategies, including a $0.20 dividend. The company is capitalizing on emerging markets like India, showing substantial growth, and aligning with global e-commerce trends to boost online sales. Strategic initiatives, new products and member incentives such as MetaBoost are aimed at growth and market share.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include a significant membership decline, impacting sales potential, and heavy reliance on volatile markets like Hong Kong and China. Additionally, deferred revenue and regulatory risks in key markets pose financial and operational concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on National Health Trends here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "What\u2019s Behind Tesla Stock\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Surge, And Is It Justified?",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has gained in recent weeks after beating delivery expectations in the second quarter. The Elon Musk-run company has seen its shares rise 40.9% over the past 30 days and now trades with some enormous valuation multiples. I\u2019m still neutral on Tesla, as I appreciate that Robotaxi and robotics could be game-changing for the business, but the valuation is hard to justify.\n\nA Resurgent Tesla\n\nIn Q2, Tesla\u2019s deliveries were down by 4.8% year-over-year (YoY), but this was better than the market expected. In the three months to June 30, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles, representing a 14.8% increase versus the first quarter. The stock has surged since, with positive figures across the electric vehicle (EV) sector inferring resurgent demand.\n\nTesla stock had already started pushing upward in June after shareholders voted in favor of giving Musk his 2018 $56 billion pay package and reincorporating the company in Texas. The news led Tesla shares to jump more than 10%, taking it above $200 a share.\n\nIs Tesla\u2019s Surge Justified?\n\nAs a manufacturer of cars, Tesla is clearly overvalued. Even Elon Musk has asked investors to value Tesla as a\u00a0robotics\u00a0or artificial intelligence (AI) company rather than one that purely focuses on the production of road vehicles \u2013 even if they are electric. As such, some analysts may question why Tesla, which was already trading on elevated multiples, has surged on the back of these improved EV deliveries. It\u2019s a good point.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at 96.4x non-GAAP forward earnings, making it the most expensive EV stock by many multiples and one of the most expensive technology companies. Moreover, the expected earnings growth rate for the next three to five years is just 11.2%, inferring that analysts see very little tangible impact from the Robotaxi business over the medium term.\n\nIn turn, this leads to a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 8.7x. That\u2019s far beyond what is normally considered attractive (1.0x or lower).\n\nOther metrics compound this unattractive valuation. The stock trades at 8.3x TTM sales and 7.9x forward sales, representing an 830% and 813% premium to the sector, respectively. Tesla\u2019s forward price-to-cash-flow ratio of 63.9x also represents a 585% premium to the sector as a whole.\n\nHowever, Musk has been touting two major developments, which are due to take place over the next 18 months. The first is the long-awaited Robotaxi \u2013 set to be unveiled on August 8 \u2013 and the second is the sale of its Optimus robots, which may start in the second half of 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Could These Developments Mean for Tesla?\n\nAutonomous driving offers Tesla the opportunity to dominate in a new and exciting segment. Looking from the outside, Tesla appears to be ahead of the game when it comes to automation. We\u2019ll learn more on August 8. Even Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen\u00a0Huang\u00a0agrees, recently noting that Tesla was \u201cfar ahead\u201d in self-driving tech.\n\nThe Robotaxi will allow Tesla to open up new revenue streams. Unsurprisingly, one of these would be ride-hailing. In 2023,\u00a076% of Tesla\u2019s revenues were generated through car sales, with a further 8% generated through servicing. Just 5.8% or $6 billion was earned through its Energy Generation and Storage division.\u00a0Ride-hailing also promises wide margins.\n\nDespite the potential of the Robotaxi, I\u2019ve seen very few analysts\u2019 forecasts that actually seek to quantify this potential. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK is one exception. According to\u00a0ARK Invest, nearly 90% of Tesla\u2019s earnings will be attributed to the Robotaxi business in 2029. In ARK\u2019s bear-case scenario, the autonomous ride-hailing business would deliver $603 billion in 2029. In its bull case scenario, this figure rises to $951 billion. In turn, this led Wood\u2019s investment fund to suggest the stock will be worth $2,600 in 2029.\n\nIt\u2019s worth recognizing that ARK Invest\u2019s forecasts have been dismissed by many as over-ambitious. For one, the global ride-hailing market is expected to be worth $215.7 billion by\u00a02028 (according to Statista). That\u2019s less than half what ARK believes Tesla would generate from ride-hailing in its bear case for 2029. I can only assume that Wood\u2019s fund is inferring that self-driving vehicles will engender a huge shift away from car ownership towards ride-hailing.\n\nThere are also question marks as to how Tesla could mass-produce a fleet of Robotaxis large enough to generate the figures projected by ARK. Assuming a production cost between $150,000 and $200,000 (per ARK Invest), building a global fleet of Robotaxis would likely cost trillions. Tesla doesn\u2019t have the necessary cash flow to build a global fleet.\n\nSince the Q1 results, Musk has also been\u00a0touting\u00a0Tesla\u2019s potential in robotics, with \u201climited production\u201d of its Optimus robot in 2025. According to Musk, robots could turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company. However, investing in Tesla for its robotics capabilities could be very speculative, considering how little we know.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, TSLA comes in as a Hold based on 12 Buys, 14 Holds, and eight Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Tesla stock price target is $180.92, implying 26.57% downside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Tesla Stock\n\nDespite Tesla being in a pole position to dominate in the autonomous era, I remain wary of Musk\u2019s overpromising. This makes it very hard to get behind a stock that\u2019s currently trading at 96.4x non-GAAP forward earnings. It could be priced for perfection, and if Musk underdelivers on August 8, the share price may pull back significantly. That\u2019s why I\u2019m remaining neutral.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 High Priced Stocks That Would Benefit From a Stock Split",
        "content": "Several high-profile stock splits have occurred recently. First, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) decided to implement a 10-for-1 stock split which took effect June 10. Shares are up slightly since then after a period of rapid price increases and subsequent cooling.\n\nThe stock more than doubled in 2024 causing the price to own a single share of Nvidia to surge above $1,000. Prices at that level tend to hurt demand, so splitting the stock is a logical choice.\u00a0Ownership becomes more accessible, increasing demand.\n\nNvidia is not the only high-profile company to recently enact a stock split. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced a similar 10-for-1 split that will take effect on July 12. It is expected to have similar positive psychological effects for investors. Broadcom shares currently trade for $1,592, putting them out of the reach of many investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all orchestrated stock splits in recent years. Let\u2019s look at seven companies that might be up next.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) seems to be an obvious choice among stocks that would benefit from a stock split. The company produces high-demand machines for which it is the only supplier globally. ASML can only produce a handful of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines it manufactures on an annual basis.\n\nThe result is a very valuable firm and stock that has grown rapidly this year. ASML\u2019s EUV lithography machines are used to produce state-of-the-art semiconductors that have applications in artificial intelligence and other high-value sectors.\n\nDue to the extreme demand, ASML shares jumped from $700 in January to above $1,000 today. Those price increases haven\u2019t caused volume to decline but it makes sense for ASML to consider a stock split regardless: High-profile chip companies are splitting their stocks under the notion it will benefit their capital structure in the long run. ASML is a logical potential target to watch next for investors who believe in the power of stock splits.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is in my opinion one of the best combination stocks available to investors. The company is part emerging e-commerce champion, part rising fintech star. I\u2019m not the only one who appreciates MercadoLibre as it has become one of the more popular stocks overall. In the process, share prices have ballooned to spectacular highs and currently trade for nearly $1,700. If ever there were a stock in need of a split, MercadoLibre is it.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company has maintained high prices for several years. That complicates the picture and suggests that the company may not implement a stock split. Prices approached $2,000 near the height of pandemic market madness. They dropped below $700 in the aftermath of austerity measures only to rise again to dizzying heights.\n\nAs with ASML, those high prices don\u2019t appear to be negatively affecting demand as measured by volume. That said, a stock split could prove to be the demand catalyst that MercadoLibre didn\u2019t know it needed.\n\nEven without a stock split, MercadoLibre stock should continue to impress based on its extremely strong fundamental growth.\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrostrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock represents a company less known for its enterprise analytics business than its Bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings. The company has gained massive notoriety for its strong and continued investment into the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBy March 31, MicroStrategy had purchased $7.535 billion worth of Bitcoin, which was valued at $15.22 billion overall at the time. At that point the average cost paid by the company per Bitcoin was just above $35,000. Although Bitcoin prices have since cooled to $61,000, the company is clearly still in the black.\n\nMicroStrategy continues to accumulate more Bitcoin, recently adding an additional 11,931 BTC to its overall holdings.\n\nThe risky move seems to have paid off for the company, which is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin overall. Share prices have been pushed well above $1,000 in 2024. Arguably, the $1,000 threshold represents a strong psychological barrier for investors. Thus, Microstrategy is another potential target for a stock split.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nI bet the name Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) means very little to most stock investors. Very few people would know the company until they realize that it owns Hoka and Ugg.\n\nMany might then recognize the strength of the company as those brands are growing very fast. The company released its fourth quarter earnings report at the end of May showing sales grew by 21% during the period, reaching $959.8 million. The better-than-expected revenues led to per-share earnings of $4.95, more than $2 higher than analysts had anticipated. Sales of Hoka shoes accounted for $533 million in sales during the period, growing by 34%.\n\nDeckers Outdoor share prices are now approaching the $1,000 threshold. The stock sat in the $250 range two short years ago.\n\nDeckers Outdoor certainly doesn\u2019t need to implement a stock split in order to spike demand: The strength of Hoka and Ugg are doing more than enough. However, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to send a strong message to the market.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) could likely reach $1 trillion in market capitalization much quicker by implementing a stock split.\n\nThe company is currently the 10th most valuable stock as measured by market cap, with a value of $811 billion. The success of weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound has catapulted\u00a0 Eli Lilly into rarified air: pundits now expect Eli Lilly to reach $1 trillion in market cap at some point in the near future. It\u2019s likely Eli Lilly could reach that threshold quicker if it so chooses.\n\nAll the company has to do is to follow the lead of Nvidia, Broadcom, and others and announce a stock split. A similar 10-for-one split would give shareholders an additional nine shares for every share held and reduce prices to $90 per share.\n\nMany investors wonder whether a pharmaceutical firm is deserving of a $1 trillion valuation. A move by Eli Lilly to assert such confidence might be exactly what is needed.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) is another high-priced stock in the pharmaceutical sector. Currently, a share of REGN stock costs more than $1,000. While the company is nowhere near Eli Lilly in terms of market cap, both companies are potential stock split targets.\n\nA few things pop out about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that suggest to me that a stock split makes a lot of sense. Simple arithmetic dictates that a 10-for-1 stock split results in updated share prices of approximately $100. That\u2019s an affordable share price that also suggests a lot of strength overall. However, the point I really want to make is that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts per-share earnings of $33.86 over the trailing 12 months. Split by a factor of 10, that still results in impressive per-share earnings of $3.39.\n\nThe point here is that a lot of really strong companies develop monstrous fundamentals when successful. In the case of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals you could argue that EPS that high almost begs for a stock split.\n\nMettler-Toledo International (MTD) scientist wearing virtual reality headset interacts with futuristic holographic interface showing neurological data\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock\n\nMettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD) is perhaps the least likely stock on this list to enact a stock split in the near future. The healthcare firm provides diagnostics and research instruments primarily for the laboratory setting.\n\nThe reason I believe Mettler-Toledo International is probably the least likely company to enact a stock split is simple history. Share prices have consistently stayed above $1,000 since late 2020. Furthermore, healthcare stocks often trade for multiple hundreds of dollars and $1,000 is far from unheard of.\n\nAt the same time, a company like Mettler-Toledo International could choose to enact a stock split to drive demand. It would likely grab attention if done correctly. After all, healthcare stocks aren\u2019t exactly the flashiest investments. Point being, Mettler-Toledo International could differentiate itself through a stock split.\n\nIt too boasts strong trailing 12-month per-share earnings that could be split with the result being a remaining $3.57 EPS.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Sometimes, consistently performing stocks aren\u2019t the headliners that financial media flocks to. Often less volatile with fewer quarter-to-quarter variations, consistently performing stocks tend to typify the \u201cboring but reliable\u201d stock segment. In a market full of growth-at-all-costs and high-flying tech, it\u2019s no wonder these consistently performing stocks go unnoticed by most.\n\nBut that\u2019s a mistake. Stabler, in many cases, with proven growth potential and a clear path forward, consistently performing stocks can anchor a well-rounded portfolio. If nothing else, they can certainly offset volatility if you simply must allocate some of your cash toward penny stocks and the more speculative small-caps.\n\nWhile one of these consistently performing stocks doesn\u2019t quite fit the \u201cboring but reliable\u201d bill, the other two certainly do \u2014 while the third is reasserting its position among consistently performing stocks but, today, is priced to buy and trades well below consensus fair value estimates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSharkNinja (SN) top down photo of a man in a red kayak on a pristine water way with greenery to the left\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Virrage Images\n\nSharkNinja (NYSE:SN) is one of my favorite consistently performing stocks. The company nailed a 20% combined annual growth rate since 2008 \u2014 not to mention its quarter-to-quarter strength. In the interim 16 years, we\u2019ve seen all sorts of economic and market conditions, including the Global Financial Crisis, political instability, and the pandemic. SharkNinja\u2019s perennially popular home appliances outperformed no matter the conditions, though, setting SharkNinja up as one of the decade\u2019s top consistently performing stocks.\n\nBank of America agrees with SharkNinja\u2019s strength and long-term potential, recently increasing its price target to $95 per share, a 26% premium over today\u2019s pricing. Analysts based their projection on SharkNinja\u2019s improved growth strategy, which centers around securing a foothold in new markets on a wholesale basis before expanding. SharkNinja demonstrated the strategy\u2019s strength this year after creating and manufacturing a new cooler line, which it then sold to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) to gain initial access before expanding its sporting goods line to include outdoor cooling and cooking equipment, possibly.\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) status among consistently performing stocks was questioned last year as electric vehicle sales slowed. Still, Elon Musk is clearly back on top as the company posted surprisingly strong vehicle delivery stats in anticipation of its end-of-July quarterly earnings report. Shares surged 10% on the news, momentum that may carry through until the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, vehicle sales aren\u2019t the only tailwinds propelling Tesla back into consistently performing stock territory. Musk is rapidly expanding his Texas gigafactory\u2019s footprint to include a massive GPU warehousing unit to situate incoming Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, an early harbinger for what may be Tesla\u2019s full-court press into expanding its position among AI competitors.\n\nMusk certainly thinks things are looking up. He recently said short sellers like Bill Gates \u201cwill be obliterated\u201d as Tesla edges closer to \u201cfully [solving] autonomy and has [its droid] Optimus in volume production.\u201d\n\nThe Andersons (ANDE) The Andersons Inc. (ANDE) Clymers Ethanol Plant located in the Cass County Agri Business Park\n\nSource: Lost Shoe Studios / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the smaller-cap side of the consistently performing stocks spectrum, agribusiness company The Andersons (NASDAQ:ANDE) may have a $1.6 billion market cap. Still, its consistent performance is huge considering its inherently unstable sector. For evidence, look no further than the company\u2019s recent dividend declaration \u2014 payable on July 22nd, the distribution is the firm\u2019s 111th quarterly dividend since first listing in 1996.\n\nThe Andersons operate with agricultural supply chains, standing out as one of the longest-running and key members of a delicate ecosystem with limited competitive risk and high barriers to entry. This all but assures The Andersons\u2019 continued dominance of the overlooked sector. The Andersons\u2019 expansion plans, which include purchasing granary stakes throughout Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado, further reinforce the point.\n\nThe Andersons company, true to form for consistently performing stocks, is a cash cow that has generated more than $315 million in cash from operations since 2021. 2020\u2019s $201 cash flow is a pandemic-induced anomaly, and the company\u2019s prospects appear bright.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Tech stocks are not invincible. Despite the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), many tech stocks are struggling and look vulnerable right now. Warning signs are flashing at many leading technology companies and can be plainly seen in quarterly financial statements, proxy votes and various sales and delivery data points.\n\nBeing aware of trouble brewing at companies is important if investors are to avoid poor-performing stocks that can drag down a portfolio and leave it deep in the red. Luckily, there is plenty of news and information available for public companies that investors can digest and use to make informed decisions about stocks.\n\nHere are three tech stocks to sell in July before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors buying shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the company reported its latest delivery figures might want to pump the breaks. While TSLA stock gained more than 15% after the company reported second-quarter electric vehicle (EV) delivery numbers, the stock is rising because the data was not as bad as feared. For Q2, Tesla deliveries totaled 443,956 vehicles.\n\nThe Q2 delivery number beat Wall Street forecasts that called for deliveries of 439,000. But despite beating analyst forecasts, Tesla\u2019s Q2 deliveries were down 4.8% from a year earlier amid a continued sales decline. At the same time, General Motors (NYSE:GM), one of Tesla\u2019s main competitors, reported that its electric vehicle sales rose 40% year-over-year in Q2 of this year.\n\nTesla is scheduled to announce its second-quarter financial results on July 23. It\u2019s looking increasingly like a make-or-break quarterly print for Tesla. If the company misses Wall Street targets, TSLA stock could tank.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) The logo for Micron Technology Inc (MU) is displayed on a large white and blue building.\n\nThe recent print from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) was a letdown, sending the share price down more than 5%. While the data storage company posted decent results for its recently completed quarter, forward guidance in line with Wall Street expectations left investors wanting more. This was especially true after MU stock gained more than 60% year-to-date on expectations for big growth fueled by AI.\n\nMicron, which manufactures computer memory and data storage products, said it expects EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $7.6 billion for the second quarter of the calendar year. Analysts had been looking for earnings of $1.05 on revenue of $7.6 billion. Micron is benefitting from the current boom in AI as its advanced memory is used with AI microchips and processors. However, Micron\u2019s smartphone and personal computer (PC) business units are struggling with weak global demand, offsetting the AI gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe latest blow to cloud computing firm Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is that its stockholders voted against the company\u2019s executive compensation plan, including for CEO Marc Benioff. The rejection comes after shareholder advisory groups raised public concerns about large equity awards granted to Salesforce executives, including Benioff. Last year, Benioff received $39.6 million in total compensation, up from $29.9 million the previous year.\n\nIn January, Salesforce\u2019s board of directors gave Benioff a stock award worth $20 million in recognition of the company\u2019s \u201c\u2026strong financial performance in the fiscal year.\u201d However, shareholders disagreed with the stock award, citing the trailing performance of CRM stock and disappointing financial results. Salesforce recently missed its quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2006. Plus, Benioff is already among the largest shareholders of Salesforce, with a stake worth over $8 billion.\n\nWhile the vote from the annual meeting is non-binding and the board of directors is not obligated to follow it, the situation shows that more cracks are forming at Salesforce. The company\u2019s stock has been flat so far in 2024, badly trailing the 23% year-to-date gain in the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We have also compiled a full free list of the 15 Fastest Growing Automotive Brands in the World.\n\nGlobal Automotive Market Trends\n\nThe global automobile manufacturing sector is one of the largest industries worldwide and has been growing over the past many years. The global automobile market was valued at $2.73 trillion in the year 2021. Among automobiles, passenger cars are the most popular in most countries. In 2022, the global passenger car market was valued at a whopping $1.66 trillion, with an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1% from 2023 to 2030. At this growth rate, the market is projected to reach an impressive valuation of $2.67 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe automobile industry has a close link to the economy and even acts as one of the barometers for a country\u2019s economic health. The rising per capita income and growing population are some of the factors that have led to increased demand for cars around the world, especially in developed countries. However, the expected growth in sales is not very promising given the poor economic conditions globally, especially in the US and China.\n\nFitch Ratings has predicted a 4% increase in global sales and production in 2024. As discussed earlier, the main reasons for a low growth rate are slower economic growth and higher interest rates that are expected to impact overall vehicle demand in 2024. However, pent-up consumer demand is going to drive the demand for the next year. S&P Global Mobility has predicted that 88.3 million new vehicles will be sold globally in 2024. With these sale units, a 2.8% year-over-year increase in global new light vehicle sales is expected.\n\nAgainst the global landscape, the United States stands as one of the largest automotive markets in the world. Almost 15.5 million new light vehicles were sold in the US in the year 2023 while the number of used vehicles sold stood at approximately 40 million.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is the best-selling electric vehicle manufacturer in the United States capturing over 50% of the U.S. EV market in 2023. Its popularity can be gauged from the number of units it sold in the US. In 2022, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) sold a total of 354,822 vehicles in America, up from 234,000 in 2021 showing a growth of 53%. However, the current year has not been the best for the company in terms of its sales and financial performance. In Q1 2024, the company\u2019s revenue was $21.3 billion, a 9% decrease year-over-year, missing estimates of $22.34 billion, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F)\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) manufactures cars, trucks, and SUVs as part of its diverse lineup. Ford\u2019s sales of electric vehicles hit a new record at 61,575 units in 2022 which was an increase of 126% compared to the prior year. These unit sales made the company the second-largest automaker of electric vehicles in America.

        "title": "Europe is slapping tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles \u2014 for now. Here's what to know",
        "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won\u2019t need to be paid until they\u2019re confirmed by a vote of EU governments before Nov. 2. The EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \u201ca means to correct an imbalance,\u201d commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \u201cWe certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\u201d\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4% on cars from BYD, 19.9% on those from Geely and 37.6% for vehicles exported by China\u2019s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden\u2019s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain\u2019s MG, one of Europe\u2019s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8%. The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \u201cindividually calculated\u201d rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible \u2014 though at present it seems unlikely \u2014 that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the Nov. 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \u201cqualified majority\u201d of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65% of the bloc's population.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers \u2014 an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 \u2014 but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD\u2019s six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \u201ca naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won\u2019t be made for four months.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\u201d he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.\n\n___\n\nMoritsugu reported from Beijing.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The swagger is back in Tesla\u2019s step.\n\nA few months ago, Elon Musk\u2019s company was the butt of every joke on Wall Street, a\u00a0growth stock with no growth to quote Wells Fargo. Pundits began questioning why anyone still even included it among the high-flying Magnificent Seven after Tesla trailed all 499 other stocks in the benchmark S&P index\u2014even the scandal-ridden Boeing.\n\nNo longer. Just in time for the start of the second half, Tesla has fully recouped its year-to-date losses after adding an eye-watering $150 billion in value to its market cap over the span of just three days this week.\n\n$TSLA investors right now pic.twitter.com/yqa3efRxkc\n\n\u2014 Teslaconomics (@Teslaconomics) July 3, 2024\n\n\u201cThe worst is in the rearview mirror for Tesla as we believe the EV demand story is starting to return to the disruptive tech stalwart,\u201d Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives wrote on Wednesday, upgrading his price target to $300 from $275 and reaffirming his \u201coutperform\u201d rating.\n\nMusk is now back to his brash old self, exchanging one fantastical growth target that defies human reason for another while warning any short seller that gets in his way will be \u201cobliterated\u201d\u2014Bill Gates included.\n\nAfter consolidating around $180 for the better part of two months, bulls see further room for gains after the stock broke above the\u00a0200-day moving average under heavy trading volume and now looks like it could snap the three-year downward trend.\n\nTesla $TSLA has done it! 2.5 year downtrend finally broken \ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udec2 pic.twitter.com/9kEQejJoNb\n\n\u2014 Barchart (@Barchart) July 3, 2024\n\nWhen one popular pro-Tesla account reminded the fan community late last month of the 2019 words of ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood regarding chart technicals that \u201cthe longer the base, the bigger the break out,\u201d Musk quickly\u00a0replied: \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nQ2 deliveries beat reduced expectations\n\nThis belief the stock has bottomed out and is poised to continue its rally in the coming months is reflected in some of the fundamentals now emerging.\n\nTuesday's announcement of second-quarter vehicle deliveries for example was a stark contrast to the first quarter figures that badly missed even the most bearish of forecasts. After expectations had consistently fallen in recent weeks, Tesla finally managed to draw a line under the issue by beating consensus with a comparatively mild decline in car sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla's second quarter sales beat estimates.\r\nAbout those estimates... https://t.co/N2EGBHVbXl via @opinion$TSLApic.twitter.com/9TmW6xCpf6\n\n\u2014 Liam Denning (@liamdenning) July 2, 2024\n\nMassive growth in its lucrative energy storage business also helped support the argument it is not just an EV company, as deployment volumes more than doubled over the previous quarterly record.\n\nMany analysts and investors had until recently argued they needed to see an end to the downward revisions in earnings estimates before sentiment could sustainably improve.\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s deliveries surprise, bulls like Ives\u2014who described the Q1 volumes as both a \u201cnightmare\u201d and \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d\u2014now believe the company has renewed the market\u2019s\u00a0faith in its growth story.\n\n\u201cThis was a huge comeback performance from Tesla and Musk in 2Q with the Street expecting a clear miss this quarter with EV demand still choppy globally, yet Tesla delivered strong numbers at a key time for investors,\u201d he continued.\n\nWith painfully high interest rates expected to ease later this year, the Aug. 8 reveal of the CyberCab robotaxi just around the corner, and a new entry level Tesla slated to debut around six months from now, the stock could be poised for further gains. It may even earn back its place in the pantheon of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nIT\u2019S FINALLY OUR TURN $TSLApic.twitter.com/XMhF3JbZ1V\n\n\u2014 TheSonOfWalkley (@TheSonOfWalkley) July 3, 2024\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a provider of artificial intelligence server infrastructure, became the market\u2019s new shiny metal object in 2024.\n\nThere are reasons to like Super Micro Computer, including an agreement to manufacture hardware for a well-known billionaire. However, it\u2019s problematic that Super Micro Computer stock is expensive and susceptible to a sustained pullback.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if you\u2019re on the hunt for the \u201cnext\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the market has already discovered and lionized Super Micro Computer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, there\u2019s another company and stock that provides excellent AI-server industry exposure. So, you don\u2019t have to invest in a richly valued market darling like Super Micro Computer.\n\nDon\u2019t Sleep on These Announcements\n\nYou might not think that brief postings on X (formerly known as Twitter) could have much importance. However, three X postings could have major implications for the generative AI market and for Super Micro Computer.\n\nJust to provide some background info, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk heads an AI startup called xAI. This new company is developing Grok, an AI chatbot that\u2019s supposed to rival OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nNot long ago, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) CEO Michael Dell stunned the tech world when he posted on X, \u201cWe\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with @nvidia to power @grok for @xai @elonmusk.\u201d This posting quickly garnered millions of views.\n\nThat same day, Musk offered some clarification in an X posting. He wrote, \u201cTo be precise, Dell is assembling half the racks that are going into the supercomputer that xAI is building.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Musk stated in posting on X that \u201cSMC\u201d or Super Micro Computer will build the other half the AI-supercomputer racks.\n\nHence, you might be tempted to load up on Super Micro Computer stock right now. After all, an agreement with Musk is generally great news, and Super Micro Computer could benefit greatly if xAI and Grok are highly successful.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s Not-So-Super Valuation\n\nBear in mind, even before Dell\u2019s and Musk\u2019s aforementioned social media postings, Super Micro Computer was already a market darling. The company\u2019s valuation suggests that some investors already pinpointed Super Micro Computer as the \u201cnext\u201d Nvidia.\n\nLet\u2019s do a side-by-side comparison to support our point. Super Micro Computer\u2019s trailing 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio is 46.18x. For reference, the sector median P/E ratio is 30.22x, and Dell Technologies\u2019 P/E ratio is 28.27x.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019d prefer to use the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio as your valuation gauge. That\u2019s fine, as Super Micro Computer\u2019s P/S ratio is 3.8x, versus the sector median P/S ratio of 2.98x.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Dell has a P/S ratio of 1.1x. So now, we\u2019re starting to get the impression that maybe Super Micro Computer isn\u2019t the business involved in the Musk deal that investors should be focusing on.\n\nHere\u2019s a Better Bet Than Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nSuper Micro Computer certainly isn\u2019t an underdog in 2024. The financial press already gave Super Micro Computer plenty of press coverage, and stock traders have quickly bid up the company\u2019s stock price. In contrast, Dell Technologies appears to be just starting on its long-term comeback.\n\nBoth companies will benefit from their arrangement with Musk and xAI, no doubt. Still, it\u2019s understandable if valuation concerns might dissuade you from buying Super Micro Computer stock right now.\n\nInstead, investors ought to consider buying Dell stock today. They might also think about taking a share position in Super Micro Computer if the price comes down 20% or 30%.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The government is given to understand that Tesla has capital issues and doesn\u2019t plan on pledging fresh investment into India in the near future, they said.\n\nThe loss of interest in India comes as Tesla reported a second consecutive drop in quarterly deliveries globally and faces heightened competition in China. Musk announced major staff reductions in April, the EV maker\u2019s first new model in years, the Cybertruck, has been slow to ramp up while construction of a new plant in Mexico has been delayed.\n\nRepresentatives from India\u2019s Ministry of Heavy Industries, which oversees the automobile sector, and the ministries of finance, and commerce and industry, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk in April scrapped a planned visit to India that would have included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing pressing issues at the company.\n\nHe had originally announced his visit just weeks after India lowered the import taxes on EVs from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest at least 41.5 billion rupees ($497 million) and start EV production from a local factory within three years.\n\nInstead, India\u2019s government is pinning its hopes on domestic automakers like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. to boost EV production, the people said. Should Musk decide to re-engage, Tesla would still be welcome to avail itself of the new import tax policy, they added.\n\nIndia\u2019s EV market is in its infancy, with battery-powered cars accounting for just 1.3% of the total last year, according to BloombergNEF. Many buyers are hesitant to make the switch due to electric cars\u2019 high upfront cost and a dearth of charging stations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Research Reports for Apple, Meta Platforms &amp; Tesla",
        "content": "Wednesday, July 3, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), as well as a micro-cap stock Natural Health Trends Corp. (NHTC).\u00a0 The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s shares have only slightly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+14.5% vs. +14.3%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple\u2019s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have far outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +32.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia/Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platform is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nAI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (-17.3% vs. -16.9%). The company\u2019s recently shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts have been plaguing Tesla. Tesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\nWith competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game-changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its \"robotaxi\" venture.\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of its Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China amid stiff competition marks a significant win. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Natural Health Trends have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Discretionary industry over the past year (+25.6% vs. -10.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $79.12 million shows a promising uptick, with an 11% quarterly order rise and a 1% annual increase, suggesting a market and operational recovery.\r\n\r\nDespite a slight revenue drop, cash flow remains positive, supported by prudent financial strategies, including a $0.20 dividend. The company is capitalizing on emerging markets like India, showing substantial growth, and aligning with global e-commerce trends to boost online sales. Strategic initiatives, new products and member incentives such as MetaBoost are aimed at growth and market share.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include a significant membership decline, impacting sales potential, and heavy reliance on volatile markets like Hong Kong and China. Additionally, deferred revenue and regulatory risks in key markets pose financial and operational concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on National Health Trends here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Coca-Cola (KO), S&P Global (SPGI) and Realty Income (O).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "NIO Stock Continues to Climb on Record Q2 Deliveries",
        "content": "Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio (NYSE:NIO) enjoyed a strong outing in the market following a near doubling of vehicle deliveries last month. Adding to the positive sentiment, the broader EV sector has witnessed impressive results. Moving forward, though, the focus will be on maintaining momentum. That may not be so easy given global economic challenges.\n\nEarlier this week, Nio announced a record month in June. Deliveries shot up to 21,209 vehicles, representing an increase of 98.1% on a year-over-year basis. Further, the company delivered 57,373 vehicles in the three months ended June. That came out to a 143.9% rise compared to the year-ago period. Cumulatively, deliveries hit 537,020 as of June 30.\n\nIn a nod to the sustainability sentiments that underline NIO stock and other EV plays, the Chinese automaker recently released its annual environmental, social and governance report. This document details both initiatives and accomplishments in forwarding a more sustainable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBolstering enthusiasm for NIO stock is the fact that other Chinese EV makers have flourished. In particular, Zeekr (NYSE:ZK) \u2013 which is owned by Geely Automobile (OTCMKTS:GELYY) \u2013 has been swinging higher off the back of its own record month. In June, the company delivered 20,106 vehicles, bringing its year-to-date count to 87,870.\n\nSustained Sentiment for NIO Stock on the Watchlist\n\nOn the other side of the world, sector giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its fortunes surge following strong second-quarter stats. During the period, the company produced 410,831 vehicles and delivered 443,956. The latter print beat analyst expectations, which called for deliveries of 439,000 vehicles. Naturally, the bullishness boosted NIO stock.\n\nNevertheless, the next step for the EV sector is to maintain and grow this momentum. That may be easier said than done. According to the latest ADP report, private payroll growth in the U.S. slipped lower in June, adding 150,000 jobs. Per CNBC, this figure was \u201cbelow the upwardly revised 157,000 in May and the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 160,000. The total was the lowest monthly gain since January.\u201d\n\nAs for the Chinese economy, earlier this year, Reuters reported that China has struggled with structural employment challenges.\n\nAdding a wrinkle to NIO stock and other Chinese businesses, the nation\u2019s Generation Z demographic is witnessing a rise in so-called \u201crevenge saving\u201d \u2013 aggressively saving money rather than flaunting wealth. It runs counter to dynamics seen in other countries, potentially impacting economic recovery efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "Tesla stock pops 6%, extends rally as 'Mojo back for Musk' after latest delivery data",
        "content": "Tesla stock (TSLA) extended gains on Wednesday, rising more than 6% after jumping 10% on Tuesday as Wall Street weighed in on the electric carmaker's quarterly vehicle delivery results that topped expectations. Tesla stock has now gained more than 70% since its most recent low in late April.\n\nTesla this week announced it produced approximately 411,000 vehicles and delivered nearly 444,000 cars during the second quarter, beating consensus estimates and marking an increase from the first quarter.\n\nAnd despite a year-over-year drop in deliveries, analysts were bullish on the report and pointed to signs the EV industry may be holding up better-than-expected.\n\n\"We continue to see scope for improving sentiment in Tesla shares as well as broader EV sentiment as compared with the negative sentiment we have seen over the past ~6 months,\" Citi analysts wrote in a note following the results on Tuesday.\n\nDan Ives at Wedbush Securities said in a note the company's deliveries marked a \"major turning point\" in the \"Tesla bull case story.\"\n\n\"The key for Tesla's stock is the Street recognizing that Tesla is the most undervalued AI play in the market,\" Ives wrote, adding that the \"Mojo back for Musk\" as he raised his price target on the stock to $300 from $275 with a new bull case of $400 for 2025.\n\nIves added the company's Robotaxi event on August 8 \"will lay the yellow brick road to [full self-driving] and an autonomous future.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley's Adam Jonas called Tesla's results the \"1st Positive Surprise of the Year,\" noting the automaker delivered 33,000 units more than it produced in the second quarter.\n\nThe analyst also highlighted a \"show stealer\" from its release \u2014 Tesla's energy storage business, which posted its highest quarterly deployment yet. The business, which includes utility-scale Megapacks, has been growing faster than the EV segment, with a record profit margin.\n\n\"Tesla started its Independence Day celebration early with a positive 2Q delivery beat, 33k lower inventory and a large storage beat to remind investors it's not just an auto company,\" wrote Jonas.\n\nHis team has an Overweight rating on the stock with a $310 price target.\n\nTesla has faced stiff competition abroad from its Chinese counterparts and faced some waning demand for EVs in the US. In an effort to reduce costs, the company embarked on a plan to cut more than 10% of its global staff earlier this year in what some analysts saw as a signal of tough times ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring Tesla's shareholder meeting last month CEO Elon Musk confirmed that near-term demand and sales would still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period.\n\nThe company also slashed prices last year to spur sales.\n\n\"There is still the risk of further price cuts ahead, and there [are] still further questions on fundamentals, we are still facing somewhat of an EV winter on demand,\" Barclays senior equity research analyst Dan Levy told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"So, good result. But I think the fundamental macro backdrop is still the same.\" Levy has an EqualWeight rating on the stock and a $180 price target.

        "content": "Tesla Inc. TSLA rose more than 10% on Jun 2 to its highest level in six months following stronger-than-expected vehicle delivery numbers for Q2. The numbers point to improved demand that may help ease concerns around excess inventory for its flagship Model 3/Y.\r\n\r\nInvestors seeking to tap the strong growth should buy ETFs having a substantial allocation to this luxury carmaker. These include Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares TSLL, MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, Simplify Volt Robocar Disruption and Tech ETF VCAR and ARK Innovation ETF ARKK.\r\n\r\nThis leading electric carmaker delivered 443,956 (422,405 Model 3/Y and 21,551 other models) cars worldwide in the second quarter. Though it is down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter, delivery numbers were better than the 436,000 that analysts had expected. The annual drop in sales reflects the increased competition in the electric vehicles market. The sales of electric vehicles were at a slower pace, which resulted in investors demanding each car sold be more profitable than before. Tesla produced 410,831 (386,576 Model 3/Y, and 24,255 other models) vehicles during the quarter.\r\n\r\nTesla provided $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States in April. It reduced prices for Model Y, its most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the United States, Model X and Model S. For the first half of the year, Tesla delivered 830,766 electric vehicles worldwide, beating China\u2019s BYD, which sold 726,153 electric vehicles (read: Beyond Tesla, Bet on Elon Musk With These Stocks & ETFs).\r\n\r\nThe strong delivery numbers indicate that Tesla\u2019s turnaround might have started. In a letter to shareholders in the last reported earnings, the leading electric carmaker said that it will accelerate the launch of new, affordable EV models, whose production might begin in early 2025, ahead of the initial target in the second half of 2025. The new and more affordable models will be built on Tesla's next-generation platform and will be produced on the same production sites as Tesla's current offerings. Additionally, Tesla is working toward increasing production by 50% this year.\r\n\r\nFurther, Tesla is betting on driverless software and artificial intelligence in an attempt to revive sales. It is slated to introduce \u201crobotaxis\u201d \u2014 a driverless car without a steering wheel or pedals on Aug 8. The next-generation vehicle is widely thought to be key to the electric automaker\u2019s survival, especially as competition heats up in the EV space.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nDirexion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (TSLL)\r\n\r\nWith AUM of $1.5 billion, Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares is by far the largest U.S.-listed single-stock ETF on the market.

        "content": "Tesla And BYD Join The Good EV News Wave\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)\u00a0disclosed\u00a0its second-quarter EV production\u00a0and delivery\u00a0figures and it topped Wall Street estimates with both as its deliveries fell\u00a0less than expected. Still, the second quarter marked\u00a0the first time the all-electric\u00a0king\u00a0posted two straight quarters of declines. These figures are the closest approximation of Tesla\u2019s sales figures which the EV pioneer does not disclose.\n\nAlso on July 2nd, BYD posted its second quarter EV sales with which it closed the gap with Tesla after returning the world\u2019s number one EV vendor title in the first quarter when its sales fell even more than Tesla's.\u00a0BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales and set a new sales record for plug-in EVs in June.\n\nTesla managed to beat estimates with price cuts and incentives.\n\nDuring the quarter ended on June 30th, Tesla made\u00a0410,831 of its EVs that include Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan, while delivering 443,956\u00a0EVs, surpassing FactSet StreetAccount\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0439,000. However, deliveries did contract by 4.8% YoY but also grew from the first quarter by 14.8%. Back in April, Tesla reported its first YoY decline in deliveries as first quarter deliveries dropped by 8.5%. Besides challenges such as temporary factory shutdowns due to an alleged arson attack at\u00a0its German Gigafactory and shipping delays caused by the Red Sea conflict, Tesla is also facing increased competition with its ageing lineup, which is why it offered discounts and initatiated a price war to boost demand, simultaneoulsy hurting its margins.\n\nMeanwhile, BYD reported its sales surged while Tesla\u2019s continue to drop.\n\nIn June, BYD reported record new EV sales, surpassing its prior highest from December 2023. In June,\u00a0BYD\u00a0sold 340,211 passenger plug-in EVs which presents a YoY growth of 35%. With\u00a0341,658 NEVs, out of which\u00a01,447 units are commercial NEVs, BYD also delivered\u00a0195,032 passenger PHEVs.\u00a0This is BYD\u2019s fourth consecutive record for PHEVs\u00a0as the segment grew\u00a057.93% YoY, rising 5.96% from May\u2019s figure. As for overseas markets, BYD sold 26,995 EVs, which is a 156.22% YoY rise but a 28% drop from May.\n\nAs for the second quarter, BYD sold a record 986,720 NEVs, which is a YoY growth of 40.25% and quarter over quarter rise of 57.56%, making BYD the largest seller of rechargeable vehicles globally. Passenger NEVs\u00a0\u00a0also made a new record as 982,747 sold passenger plug-ins, representing a YoY growth rate of 40.34% and quarter-over-quarter increase of 57.39%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the better than expected deliveries, Tesla has undoubtedly hit a speed bump after years of impressive growth. It did warn back in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be \"notably lower\" as the\u00a0boost from from months-long price cuts begins to fade.\u00a0But meanwhile, BYD continued\u00a0to grow with EV upstarts like Nio Inc\u00a0(NYSE: NIO) having\u00a0doubled its second quarter deliveries\u00a0to 57,373 EVs, topping its own guidance. On Monday, Nio reported a stellar second quarter as it posted a new record. Along with record second quarter deliveries, Nio also reported record high deliveries for June. In June alone, Nio delivered\u00a021,209\u00a0vehicles, more specifically\u00a011,581 SUVs and 9,628 sedans. In May, Nio launched its new lower-priced brand Onvo which is challenging Tesla directly, more specifically its best-selling Model Y, which is also the world\u2019s best-selling EV. Therefore, although Tesla\u2019s delivery figures came in better than expected, its rivals are doing even better. All in all, the EV market had a better-than-expected June.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Best EV stocks and related subjects are receiving immense attention due to the secular growth in the electric car market, which is projected to reach $951.9 billion by 2030 from $388.1 billion.\n\nChina sets ambitious sales targets and spends extensively on EV infrastructure; hence, it is a main player in the development of this industry.\n\nWith 46.7% of total vehicle sales in China in May, a new monthly high, sales of new energy vehicles\u2014including EVs and plug-in hybrids\u2014accounted for a significant portion. Moreover, Chinese EV manufacturers revealed record deliveries in June.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn 2023, new energy vehicles accounted for 32% of sales. This objective grows yearly; by 2030, it will be 40%; by 2035, it will be 50%. China\u2019s bigger strategy aims for these goals as part of achieving peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Tax exemptions for purchases also reduce the cost of owning an electric car, negating the 10% purchase tax.\n\nChina also intends to create a network of charging stations sufficient to run over 20 million electric cars by 2025.\n\nAll these elements will help an investor discover several of the greatest EV stocks in the Chinese market, a fantastic spot to start investing in this field.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) delivered 35,020 cars in May, up 23.8% year over year. So far, 774,571 vehicles have been delivered. The company concentrated on the Li L6, which has sold about 15,000 units since April.\n\nMoreover, Li Auto and Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) future electric car fleets will use DRIVE Thor centralized vehicle computers. This strategy should improve vehicle performance and autonomous driving capability.\n\nLi Auto\u2019s most recent Li L7 and L8 Air models feature improved coil springs and CDC dampers. The RMB 301,800 and RMB 321,800 variants are RMB 18,000 cheaper than previous versions. This pricing strategy will enable Li Auto to make its autos more fairly affordable.\n\nHowever, Li Auto encountered more challenging pricing than projected, albeit beginning in 2024 with tremendous enthusiasm. This has modified its financial outlook and produced a cautious Q2 prediction, with expected car deliveries falling between 105,000 and 110,000.\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) dropped Li Auto\u2019s price estimate for shares to $36 from $41, highlighting the company\u2019s intentional price reductions. These reductions are meant to boost the customer base but inevitably lead to margin erosion.\n\nLi Auto is reportedly laying off employees at an above-average 18% rate. These elements led to a steep selloff of 44% this year; analysts are projecting an 81% potential upside from the current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nXPeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nXPeng (NYSE:XPEV) delivered 10,146 automobiles in May 2024, 35% more than in the same month last year. The X9 model is still leading its class in China, so it\u2019s no surprise that analysts project a 52% upside for XPEV.\n\nAt its AI Day event in May, XPeng unveiled XOS 5.1.0, an artificial intelligence-powered in-car operational system. This includes the first artificial intelligence valet driver, emphasizing XPeng\u2019s leadership in automotive artificial intelligence technology.\n\nFor XPeng, introducing AI-powered driving assistance systems marks a significant technological advancement toward the third quarter of 2024 total national road coverage.\n\nA master agreement between XPeng and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) will allow them to co-develop intelligent connected automobiles (ICVs). Using XPeng\u2019s G9 platform and software technologies, the deal seeks to co-develop two B-class battery electric vehicle (BEV) models for the Chinese market. Starting in 2026 is production.\n\nThe two firms will also participate in a Joint Sourcing Program for shared automotive components to increase their competitiveness and save costs.\u200b\u200b\n\nFrom 2026, Volkswagen\u2019s China Main Platform vehicles will include XPeng\u2019s existing E/E Architecture, hence boosting their technological and cost competitiveness.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nRising to dominate the market and surpassing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) sold 1.2713 million new energy cars in China in the first five months of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, BYD disclosed plans for a second European plant despite the slowing down of the EV sector. This effort aims to increase its profile in the European market and counteract any impact of more levies on Chinese electric cars.\n\nTheir first plug-in hybrid pickup truck is the BYD Shark. This automobile has an over 500-mile range and 5.7-second acceleration from 0 to 62 mph, so it is under BYD\u2019s strategy. The Shark will help make its fleet more appealing to a bigger market.\n\nFurthermore, the corporation\u2019s Integrated Vehicle Intelligence strategy and the self-developed XUANJI Architecture were shown at the BYD Dream Day 2024 event. This technology integrates strong artificial intelligence with electricity to increase vehicle safety, comfort, and general intelligence. BYD also displayed the first vehicle-integrated unmanned aircraft system among numerous cutting-edge innovations.\n\nIn June, BYD introduced its third EV model in Japan as part of its worldwide development projects. This effort aims to make BYD more prominent in global markets and compete with other major manufacturers of electric automobiles.\n\nFinally, BYD\u2019s $138 million showcase dominated the 2024 Shenzhen Auto Show. New models like the BYD Seal 06 and Qin L DM-i were shown, and the first major public demonstration of floating driving technology worldwide.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "BYD Set To Surpass Tesla In BEV Sales By 2024 As China Leads Global Market Growth: Report\n\nBYD Co., Ltd. (OTC:BYDDY) is reportedly poised to significantly increase its market share in the battery electric vehicle (BEV) sector in 2024, surpassing Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in sales. This highlights the evolving dynamics of the global EV market.\n\nAccording to a Counterpoint Research report, China continues to lead the BEV market, with projections indicating its sales will quadruple those of North America by 2024.\n\nBYD reported a 21% increase in\u00a0electric vehicle sales for the second quarter, selling 426,039 EVs from April to June.\n\nTexas-based Tesla reported second-quarter deliveriesthat declined 4.8% to 443,956 vehicles from a year ago, although improving from the first quarter.\n\nAlso Read: Tesla Deliveries Fall For Second Straight Quarter, But Stock Takes Off As Q2 Numbers Exceed Expectations\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, BYD\u2019s total production, including both battery-only powered cars and hybrids, exceeded 3 million vehicles in the previous year, surpassing Tesla\u2019s production of 1.84 million cars for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe Counterpoint Research note further writes \u2013 China is anticipated to maintain over 50% of global BEV sales until 2027 and is forecasted to surpass North America and Europe combined in BEV sales by 2030, the report read.\n\nEurope and the U.S. are expected to emerge as significant growth drivers in this sector starting in 2025.\n\nRecently, the European Union announced plans to impose extra tariffs on Chinese EV companies.\n\nBYD faces an additional tariff rate of 17.4%, while Geely will incur an extra 20% duty. SAIC will bear the highest additional tariff of 38.1% among the three Chinese EV firms mentioned, CNBC added.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs might push Chinese automakers towards emerging markets like the Middle East and Africa, Latin America,\u00a0Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The outcome of EU-China talks, especially with Germany\u2019s opposition, will shape future EV market dynamics, with\u00a0Europe\u00a0and the\u00a0US\u00a0driving growth from 2025 onwards,\u201d The Counterpoint Research note added.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Tesla Shorts Were Profitable This Year Until Shareholders Approved Musk\u2019s Pay Package, Expert Says\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nStory continues\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article BYD Set To Surpass Tesla In BEV Sales By 2024 As China Leads Global Market Growth: Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 IPO Gems Flying Under the Radar (for Now)",
        "content": "Though Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) may have been the most recent big-name IPO, the initial listings market is still cooking, and undervalued IPO stocks abound. The last undervalued IPO stock I picked at the beginning of June,Nano NuclearEnergy (NASDAQ:NNE), returned over 300% since I first noticed it, further proving that undervalued IPO stocks are out there if you know where to look.\n\nIn general, the wider IPO market is improving as the year\u2019s first half saw 86 U.S.-based IPOs raise nearly $18 billion, a 12% and 67% improvement, respectively, compared to 2024\u2019s first half. That does, of course, still pale compared to 2021\u2019s shockingly high IPO rates that raised more than $450 globally, but still far better than last year as economic conditions soften. This, of course, benefits undervalued IPO stocks as many still shy away from their inherent \u201copening day\u201d risk. These undervalued IPOs often fly under the radar as investors focus primarily on tech and mega-caps \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t detract from their long-term upside.\n\nViking Holdings (VIK) MV Viking Star in North Sea Canal. Detail of funnel. VIK stock and VIK IPO\n\nSource: StudioPortoSabbia / Shutterstock.com\n\nViking Holdings (NYSE:VIK) is an undervalued IPO stock operating within a segment that\u2019s been beaten down in recent years but is due for a resurgence: luxury cruising and passenger transport. The cruise liner stock accomplishes this with a fleet of almost 100 small, high-tech ships. Viking is the largest undervalued IPO stock on our list at a $14.35 billion market cap and the company\u2019s shares jumped nearly 40% since first listing in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s waterborne operations primarily focus on river boating, with 80 existing vessels and 18 more to be delivered in the next two years. But Viking is increasing its oceanic presence and will augment its existing nine seafaring ships with eight more by the end of the decade. Viking seeks to differentiate itself from most cruise liners, which emphasizes partying and ship-centric activities rather than destination arrival. A generally youth-skewing crowd says that \u201cVikings are contrarians, and hence, from the beginning, the vision has been to build a different cruise line.\u201d This led Viking to emphasize \u201cquiet, understated elegance\u201d and a destination focus that targets older demographics of 55+.\n\nViking\u2019s financials already point to a sector-wide turnaround, with revenue improving 14% year-over-year between the first quarters of 2024 and 2023. Expect these tailwinds to continue as the undervalued IPO stock sets sail.\n\nProficient Auto Logistics (PAL) A photo of a large shipping vessel at sea.\n\nSource: Daniel Wright98 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nProficient Auto Logistics (NASDAQ:PAL) operates within a logistics and transportation segment that\u2019s nearly impossible to replace or substitute: vehicular transport, as in the type that brings cars from manufacturers to dealerships, ports and railyards. The company\u2019s IPO is unique in that it was a merger of five existing companies under a single umbrella that went public, with shares climbing about 8% since the IPO.\n\nProficient Auto\u2019s customer list is a who\u2019s who of manufacturers and includes Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN). Though some car manufacturers, like Tesla, prefer to vertically integrate their value chain as much as possible, logistics of this type tends to be a bridge too far from a pricing and resource management perspective, so Proficient Auto has plenty of business in its future.\n\nProficient saw its net deliveries slump in 2023 amid labor strikes at General Motors and Stellantis and generally reduced consumer interest in car purchases. But that downward trend is already reversing as the company\u2019s total units delivered increased by 2% in this year\u2019s first quarter report \u2014 expect that upward momentum to continue throughout the year as Proficient realizes synergies it created through combining multiple companies and generally improving its own internal processes.\n\nKindlyMD (KDLY) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock. Healthcare Tech Stocks. Healthcare Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nI want to first acknowledge that, among these undervalued IPO stocks, KindlyMD (NASDAQ:KDLY) trades firmly in penny stock territory at less than $3 per share and a meager $15 million market cap. However, its small size makes KindlyMD\u2019s undervalued IPO prospects more appealing. The company operates at the forefront of two unique trends: medical cannabis, which is ready to boom, and holistic treatments that blend prescription medication, behavioral and mental therapy and alternative solutions that \u201ctreat the whole person, not just their symptoms.\u201d\n\nKindlyMD\u2019s first earnings report came shortly after its IPO, and top-line numbers were considerably low at just $829,000 in revenue. But that slim sales stat is, practically speaking, a short-term hurdle toward long-term success. Specifically, KindlyMD hit a range of benchmarks that all but assure expansion and growth in the coming years. That includes becoming Utah\u2019s first alternative medicine company to contract under the state\u2019s insurance, including Medicare/Medicaid. It contracted with mega-insurer federation Blue Cross Blue Shield and secured 16% of Utah\u2019s current total addressable medical cannabis market. Better yet, for cannabis stock enthusiasts, KindlyMD and Curaleaf (OTCMKTS:CURLF) started a collaboration to expand awareness of alternative treatment opportunities throughout Utah.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The 3 Smartest Robotics Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "The growth of artificial intelligence is a rising tide that raises all ships. This is evident when looking at one-year growth of companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), through a historic AI bull run that we are still in. Technology that helps corporations automate and make day-to-day tasks more efficient will be prevalent in the coming years. Just as automated machines took factory workers\u2019 jobs, robots will start to do the same in multiple sectors.\n\nThis is backed by the robotics industry\u2019s compound annual growth rate, which projected to be 18% through 2034. This is indicative of strong growth \u2013 even in companies that don\u2019t match the industry average.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three robotics stocks that will give you favorable returns in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not the first thing that comes to mind when you think robotics stocks. The company is a globally renown EV manufacturer. But Tesla is expanding into the robotics sector through products such as Robotaxi and Optimus (Tesla Bot). However, Tesla\u2019s core EV business is currently struggling, representing a risk investors should factor in.\n\nTesla\u2019s financials are pretty good; it has a profit margin of 14.3%, an operating cash flow of $10.98 billion, and an EBITDA of $12.26 billion. However, quarterly revenue is down 8.7% from a year ago, with earnings growth down more than 55%. This is primarily due to delivery expectations falling. EV sales in the second quarter are expected to fall as much 12%. However, other sources suggest that this quarter marks the \u201crebound\u201d with innovations such as Robotaxi carrying the company\u2019s growth.\n\nRobotaxi is Tesla\u2019s spin on the autonomous taxi. CEO Elon Musk has been teasing this for a while, but Robotaxi\u2019s official reveal date has yet to be confirmed. Hinting to its release, the company recently patented a self-cleaning feature for Robotaxi. This shows a step in the right direction. Analysts are projecting this as being a huge catalyst, so it is best to move now and buy TSLA stock.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NYSE:ISRG) is a robotics company that specializes in products used in the healthcare sector. It has seen immense growth over the past year and is up 30% in 2024. Strong revenue and earnings growth make this pick a buy.\n\nISRG currently has a profit margin of 27.1%, with an operating margin of 24.8%. The company has $7.32 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, with quarterly revenue increasing by 11.5% in the last year. Profitability is very strong, with an earnings growth of 53.4% in the same period. The company has $4.8 billion in cash; enabling ISRG to expand its research and development departments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is projecting 16.1% growth over the next five years. This is based on multiple catalysts, including the adoption of its systems and developments in AI, but counterbalanced by supply constraints. The company\u2019s Da Vinci system has grown by 14% from a year ago with utilization up 2%. The increased prevalence of AI in the medical field also boosts ISRG stock. However, supply constraints are leading to ISRG losing sales; any missed sale means that the company misses out on market share. That being said, ISRG is still a solid robotics stocks pick.\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) operates in the autonomous food delivery niche. While it is a newer company, it saw immense publicity over the past few months. SERV is up 1% over the past five days, but is down 92% year-to-date. While this seems to be a negative sign, analysts are projecting an average price target of $46.33, representing a growth potential of over 2,200%.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials aren\u2019t great; the operating margin is a loss of 814.55%, EBITDA is a loss of $21.33 million, and operating cash flow is loss of $16.34 million. This led to the company losing a lot of money \u2013 debt stands at $8.47 million. However, a saving grace is that quarterly revenue is up 2,252%, which is extremely impressive for a company this small.\n\nA leading growth catalyst for SERV is its partnership with industry heavyweights \u2013 this includes Uber (NYSE:UBER), Nvidia, and 7-Eleven. These partnerships have become increasingly useful as they provide SERV with legitimacy and leverage. Recently, SERV announced that it would be expanding operations in Los Angeles, with Uber Eats helping SERV cover areas of Koreatown.\n\nInsiders and institutions control 44.2% of SERV stock, which should make investors confident. This suggests that people believe this company has a ways to go. Thus, it is a great low-cost robotics stock investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tesla retained its title as the world's largest pure electric vehicle (EV) maker after beating sales forecasts for the April to June period but its lead over its competitors is narrowing as Chinese manufacturers launch an array of models at cheaper prices.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based company delivered 443,956 vehicles to customers during the quarter, beating a median forecast of 439,302 units in a Bloomberg survey of analysts, edging out BYD, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which churned out 426,039 pure electric cars in the same period.\n\nInclusive of plug-in hybrid vehicles, BYD's production would be the world's largest. All of Tesla's production models belong to the battery electric vehicles (BEV) category, also defined as pure electric cars.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nBYD's total deliveries - which comprise pure electric and hybrid vehicles - in the second quarter hit 982,747 units, up 57.4 per cent from the three months ending March, according to its previous statements.\n\nBYD electric cars waiting to be loaded onto a ship are seen stacked at the international container terminal of Taicang Port in Suzhou, in China's eastern Jiangsu province on February 8, 2024. Photo: AFP alt=BYD electric cars waiting to be loaded onto a ship are seen stacked at the international container terminal of Taicang Port in Suzhou, in China's eastern Jiangsu province on February 8, 2024. Photo: AFP>\n\nAt the end of May, the Shenzhen-based carmaker unveiled a new and improved version of its plug-in hybrid technology, which enables an electric car to go as far as 2,100km on a single charge with a full tank of petrol.\n\nChina is now the world's largest automotive and EV market, with electric cars accounting for 60 per cent of global sales.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD, for the first time, overtook Tesla to take pole position as the world's top BEV maker, but Tesla regained the top spot in the first quarter of 2024, when it recorded deliveries of 386,810 units worldwide, versus BYD's 300,114.\n\nA raft of Chinese carmakers, ranging from BYD to state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor and EV start-up Hozon New Energy Automobile, have ramped up their overseas expansion plans over the past two years as they strengthen their design and manufacturing abilities.\n\nWhile that may have reduced Tesla's lead, it is unlikely to diminish its popularity.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Despite Chinese EV assemblers' growing might around the world, the popularity of Tesla's vehicles has not been largely affected,\" said Gao Shen, an independent analyst in Shanghai. \"Chinese carmakers' path to the international markets will not turn out to be smooth because they face both a strong rival and curbs from various governments.\"\n\nHowever, punitive measures could act as deterrents in markets like the US and the European Union, where authorities slapped additional tariffs of up to 100 per cent on Chinese-made electric cars due to the government subsidies. The European Commission said \"the battery electric vehicles value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury to European Union BEV producers\".\n\nBYD's pure EVs are priced from 100,000 yuan (US$13,749) to 200,000 yuan, while Tesla's Shanghai-made Model 3 starts at 231,900 yuan, and the basic edition of Model Y is offered at 249,900 yuan.\n\nTesla's Gigafactory in Shanghai remained the company's largest production base worldwide, according to its statement. The plant shipped 205,747 vehicles to customers in both China and abroad between April and June, which accounted for 46.3 per cent of Tesla's global total in the same period.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Asian shares were mostly higher on Wednesday after Tesla shares zoomed up more than 10%, helping to drive U.S. benchmarks to new records.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.3% to finish at 40,580.76. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained nearly 0.3% to 7,739.90. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.5% to 2,794.71. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.1% to 17,956.55, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.4% to 2,982.38.\n\nAsian investors were cheered by hopes for an interest rate cut in the U.S. But some traders were keeping to the sidelines ahead of Thursday\u2019s Independence Day holiday in the U.S.\n\n\u201cOn the radar is the Japan\u2019s Nikkei, which may extend its run above the 40,000 level, with overnight strength in tech while the Japanese yen continues to trade at a 38-year low,\u201d said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG.\n\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 161.80 Japanese yen from 161.44 yen. The euro cost $1.0752, little changed from $1.0743. Among Tokyo technology-related shares, Kyocera Corp. jumped 3.1% while Murata Manufacturing Co. surged 6.4%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 added 0.6% to 5,509.01, topping its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 39,331.85, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.8% to 18,028.76, besting its own record set a day earlier.\n\nTesla led the way with a 10.2% jump after the electric-vehicle maker reported a milder drop in sales  for the spring than analysts expected. Modest gains for other big, influential stocks also helped lift the market, including a 1.6% climb for Apple.\n\nStocks got a lift from easing Treasury yields after the head of the Federal Reserve  made comments that investors took as a signal for possible cuts to interest rates later this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a nod to improvements in inflation data after some disappointingly high readings early in the year.\n\n\u201cWe just want to understand that the levels that we\u2019re seeing are a true reading of underlying inflation,\u201d he said during a panel discussion at the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy conference in Sintra, Portugal.\n\nInvestors hope inflation will slow enough to convince the Fed to lower its main interest rate, which has been sitting at its highest level in more than two decades and pressing the brakes on the economy.\n\nKeeping Wall Street\u2019s gains in check was Nvidia, which has been one of this year\u2019s brightest stars. It fell 1.3%, though it\u2019s still up nearly 147.7% for the year so far.\n\nEli Lilly fell 0.8%, and U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk dropped 1.7% after President Biden criticized in an opinion piece for USA Today how much the companies are charging for their drugs for weight loss and diabetes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe week\u2019s most anticipated economic data will arrive on Friday, when the U.S. government reports the total jobs employers added in June. Before then, the U.S. stock market will have a shortened trading day on Wednesday and Thursday's Fourth of July holiday.\n\nTreasury yields have been feeling some upward pressure recently because of politics. Last week\u2019s debate  between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump pushed traders to make moves in anticipation of a possible Republican sweep in November. That included sending Treasury yields higher, in part because of the possibility for policies that would further raise the U.S. government\u2019s debt.\n\nThe 10-year yield is still well above its 4.29% level from late Thursday, before the debate.\n\nIn commodities markets, the price of benchmark U.S. oil ended up slipping modestly after touching its highest price since April. Crude prices have largely been rising on expectations for strong demand during the summer, as well as the possibility of hurricanes damaging oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Beryl  is roaring through the Caribbean.\n\nU.S. benchmark crude added 33 cents to $83.14 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 38 cents to $86.62 a barrel.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Akash Sriram and Abhirup Roy\n\n(Reuters) - Better-than-expected U.S. electric-vehicle sales in the second quarter brought welcome relief to investors after a sharp slowdown in demand triggered by high interest rates, but EV makers still face a bumpy road ahead.\n\nGeneral Motors, Rivian and Toyota posted upbeat EV deliveries on Tuesday, while Tesla reported a smaller-than-expected decline, and investors responded by driving up shares of several of the stocks.\n\nDemand for EVs has grown more slowly than expected due to high borrowing costs, economic uncertainty and consumer preference for gasoline-electric hybrids. That led Tesla and other EV brands to slash prices or offer greater incentives to lure consumers to showrooms.\n\nAnalysts said the pressure to continue cutting costs in manufacturing and batteries will not go away.\n\nEV sales globally are expected to rise to 16.6 million vehicles this year, from 13.7 million in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency, with China's growth outpacing other regions.\n\nAnalysts caution, however, that Tuesday's sales figures are insufficient to forecast a reacceleration of EV sales growth.\n\n\"We're expecting this period of time to have bumps along the way for the next few years as the transition goes from early adopters to mainstream buyers and we're going to see this happen for a long time,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions.\n\n\"Some quarters will be up, some quarters will be down, but all in all, it won't be as strong a growth as we saw over the last few years,\" he added.\n\nGM reported a 40% increase in EV sales in the U.S. in the second quarter.\n\n\"We can win as more customers embrace EVs and we can keep winning if they want to stay with the engine technologies they know,\" GM's North American president, Marissa West, said in a statement.\n\nEven Toyota, which has ridden demand for hybrid gasoline-powered vehicles to strong sales, cited the growing demand. It plans to start building two new EVs for the U.S. market at its Kentucky and Indiana plants starting in 2026.\n\n\"We're continuing to hear some positive demand from the marketplace,\" Damon Rose, vice president of sales for the Toyota brand, told Reuters. A Kia spokesman said that although the percentage growth might not be as sharp as a year earlier, overall EV sales continue to grow at a very strong pace.\n\nRivian, Tesla and Hyundai did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo stimulate demand, China has introduced subsidies of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,375.29) each for auto trade-ins, and automakers like Tesla and BYD are offering zero-interest loans and no-down-payment options in that market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese incentives and similar efforts by Elon Musk's Tesla in the United States helped the EV market leader beat delivery expectations despite a second consecutive quarterly decline.\n\n\"But this isn't the time to claim victory over a weak EV market. Tesla would need a mammoth second half to match last year's volumes, which is probably unlikely,\" said Matt Britzman, Tesla shareholder and equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nTesla has shifted focus over the past few months to its artificial-intelligence efforts such as its soon-to-be unveiled robotaxi product and Optimus humanoid robot to combat the slowdown in EV sales, which generate more than 80% of its quarterly revenue.\n\nEV fans are not shaken in their resolve by any warning signs, however.\n\n\"Given how bearish the market was on the EV play - and particularly on Tesla - in the last couple of quarters, these factors should lead to a repricing of the EV story on Wall Street,\" Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said in an email.\n\n\"It's a multitude of positive catalysts that have gathered at the right time,\" he added. \"What we can say is that the EV proposition - at least for the bigger players - is looking much brighter now than it did just two months ago.\"\n\n($1 = 7.2712 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru, Abhirup Roy and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco, Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Many themes have been present in the market over the last several years, keeping investors busy and trying to find the next \u2018big thing.\u2019 In particular, the dominant story over the previous year has been the AI frenzy, causing many related stocks to see outsized moves.\n\nBut recently, the EV theme has regained some life, with stocks such as Tesla TSLA and Rivian Automotive RIVN enjoying strong price action following solid delivery numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s been driving the share outperformance.\n\nTesla Bounces Back\n\nTesla shares faced pressure to start the year, bringing about considerable scrutiny. However, the stock has fully regained its mojo over the last month, gaining nearly 40% compared to a 4% gain from the S&P 500. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares popped in today\u2019s session following the release of its delivery/production data. The EV leader's Q2 deliveries reached 444k, and EVs produced totaled 411k. The results pleased investors, though it\u2019s worth noting that deliveries were down a modest 4.1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nMargins will undoubtedly be in focus for the company\u2019s quarterly release, which is expected on July 17. Recent margin pressures have been a focus among investors, helping explain the stock\u2019s slow start to 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRivian Posts Strong Deliveries\n\nRivian Automotive similarly saw positivity following the release of its delivery numbers, helping build on recent strength. Up 34% over the last month, the stock has finally begun to enjoy buying pressure, though it\u2019s worth noting that shares are still down 30% YTD. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning the numbers, the company produced roughly 9.6k vehicles and delivered approximately 13.8k, in line with Rivian\u2019s expectations. Undoubtedly boding positive, the company also reaffirmed its annual production guidance of roughly 57k vehicles.\n\nThe company\u2019s next quarterly release is scheduled for August 6 after the market\u2019s close. Analysts have taken their sales expectations higher over the recent weeks, with the $997 million expected well above the $923 million expected near the end of June. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe EV theme has emerged slightly over the last week or so thanks to positive delivery numbers from Tesla TSLA and Rivian Automotive RIVN.\n\nIt reflects a considerable change in sentiment overall, particularly considering the slow starts that many EV stocks had in 2024.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Tesla TSLA shares spiked +9% on Tuesday after the auto giant stated it delivered 443,956 EV\u2019s during the second quarter which topped most analyst estimates of 439,302 deliveries.\n\nThis comes after Chinese EV automakers such as Nio NIO\u00a0and Li Auto LI\u00a0posted increased deliveries for Q2 yesterday with Tesla's factory in Shanghai being critical to its production.\n\nExtending its latest rebound and soaring over +20% in the last three months, investors may be wondering if it\u2019s still time to buy Tesla\u2019s stock after concerns of slower sales growth caused TSLA to plummet earlier in the year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSales Outlook\n\nTesla has now missed top and bottom-line expectations for three consecutive quarters so of course Wall Street will pay close attention to its Q2 report on Wednesday, July 17. Tesla\u2019s top-line results will be scoured the most which have been an optimistic indicator of the EV leader's future earnings potential.\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, Tesla\u2019s Q2 sales are projected at $24.9 billion which would be a slight decrease from the $24.93 billion the automaker brought in a year ago. Overall, Tesla\u2019s total sales are expected to rise just 1% in fiscal 2024 but are projected to jump 15% in FY25 to $113.03 billion.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nPositive earnings estimate revisions are typically the biggest indicator of more upside in a stock and unfortunately, Tesla\u2019s fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have fallen -6% in the last 60 days from estimates of $1.99 per share to $1.86 a share.\n\nHowever, FY25 EPS estimates are up 1% in the last two months from $2.55 a share to $2.58 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Despite investor sentiment continuing to rise after positive Q2 deliveries, Tesla's financial results later in the month will be crucial to more upside especially considering the cautious trend of earnings estimate revisions for FY24.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Elon Musk got his mega-pay package, but Marc Benioff might not be so lucky",
        "content": "CEOs\u2019 cups runneth over, largely because they\u2019re serving themselves. And the billionaire CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, is no exception. But it seems as if Benioff\u2019s spree is slowing down ever so slightly, as his shareholders just pumped the brakes on his latest hefty compensation package.\n\nAlongside the suggested pay plans of other Salesforce executives, Benioff\u2019s proposed compensation was rejected by 404.8 million votes (versus 339.3 million in favor), according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Monday.\n\nLike many bigwigs, Benioff\u2019s real worth comes from his stock options. His base salary stayed at $1.55 million, but he raked in $39.6 million in the 2024 fiscal year. The prior year, Benioff made $29.9 million, and his worth ballooned as Salesforce offered him yet more stock grants, including a $20 million equity opportunity in the plan shareholders just rejected, according to a Salesforce proxy statement.\n\nWhile the board encouraged shareholders to accept said proposal, two shareholder advisory companies, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, suggested otherwise, according to CNBC. The shareholders\u2019 vote, however, is not binding, meaning Benioff could still get his million-dollar bonus.\n\nSalesforce did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBoth executives and shareholders have made out quite nicely in the shadow of the pandemic. Shareholder payouts and CEO pay have \u201crisen to record levels,\u201d according to nonprofit Oxfam's report analyzing more than 200 of the largest U.S. corporations. CEO pay has jumped by 31% from 2018 to 2022, per said study.\n\n\u201cThe rules are being rigged, and the companies are helping to rig them,\u201d Irit Tamir, senior director of Oxfam America\u2019s private sector department, told Fortune in March, adding that \u201cwe are essentially in a new Gilded Age.\u201d\n\nLook no further than Elon Musk\u2019s recent victory to see how the game is played. Earlier this year, a judge in Delaware ruled that Musk\u2019s proposed pay package for Tesla, worth a record $55 billion, wasn't justified and called it an \u201cunfathomable sum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe process leading to the approval of Musk\u2019s compensation plan was deeply flawed,\u201d Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick wrote, adding that the CEO \u201chad extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nEven so, the board pushed back against this decision and asked shareholders again to vote on the package. They overwhelmingly sided with Musk, granting back a pay plan now valued at $44.9 billion, per the Associated Press. That\u2019s even though Musk has been criticized for splitting his attention among too many projects, even being called an \u201cabsent CEO\u201d by Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber.\n\nStory continues\n\nGerber, a shareholder himself, excoriated the Tesla board ahead of its second vote. \u201cNot only is the board not independent, they basically work for Elon,\u201d he told Fox Business. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve just got to say, this board needs to be replaced.\u201d\n\nEven so, Musk\u2019s absence appears to be worth billions in the pandemic era of the CEO. The same can\u2019t be said for Benioff as of yet\u2014but that could change.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla stock (TSLA) jumped more than 10% on Tuesday after the electric vehicle giant reported quarterly vehicle deliveries that beat Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe EV maker delivered 443,956 vehicles during the second quarter, versus an analyst consensus estimate of 439,302, per Bloomberg data.\n\n\u201cIn the second quarter, we produced approximately 411,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 444,000 vehicles,\u201d read a company statement. Broken down by car type, Tesla said it delivered 422,405 models 3/Y and 21,551 other models.\n\nThat second quarter total delivery figure is higher than the 386,810 vehicles globally delivered in the first quarter but lower than the approximate 466,140 delivered a year ago.\n\nDespite the year-over-year drop in deliveries, some analysts pointed to signs the EV industry may be holding up better than expected.\n\n\"We continue to see scope for improving sentiment in Tesla shares as well as broader EV sentiment as compared with the negative sentiment we have seen over the past ~6 months,\" wrote Citi analysts on Tuesday.\n\n\"From here, the focus will turn to Tesla's Q2 auto gross margins to gauge the price vs. cost equation (Tesla reports July 23), as well as any updates on future product launches,\" said the note.\n\nTesla has faced stiff competition abroad from its Chinese counterparts amid a waning market for EVs. In an effort to reduce costs, Tesla embarked on a plan to cut more than 10% of its global staff earlier this year in what some analysts saw as a signal of tough times ahead.\n\nDuring Tesla's shareholder meeting last month CEO Elon Musk confirmed that near-term demand and sales will still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Musk said with regard to the EV market, adding that competitors have also been scaling back their investments and production of electric vehicles.\n\nAhead of the delivery numbers on Monday, Wells Fargo analysts noted the company\u2019s gross margin will likely be impacted amid a crowded market. During Tesla's shareholder meeting last month CEO Elon Musk confirmed that near-term demand and sales will still struggle. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, Pool, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\u201cFlattening EV adoption in the US and EU, with aggressive competition in China leave little immediate levers to pull to increase volumes,\u201d wrote Colin Langan and his team. The firm has an Underweight rating on the stock with a $120 price target.\n\nTesla does not break out its sales of the Cybertruck, but investors have been able to pick up on hints about those deliveries based on recalls. Last month Tesla announced its fourth Cybertruck recall since the vehicle\u2019s release late last year. Within the recall notice, 11,688 trucks appeared to be affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of the deliveries print, Tesla shares gained more than 6% on Monday as Chinese peers Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO), and XPeng (XPEV) reported better-than-expected deliveries.\n\nTesla shares have rallied more than 55% since their 52-week low on April 22. The stock is down almost 7% year to date.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investing in the best Chinese stocks can offer much needed strategic portfolio diversification.\n\nThe past few years have been tough for Chinese stocks, weighed down by regulatory changes, geopolitical tensions and a lackluster economy. However, in the past few quarters, we\u2019ve seen these headwinds subside, offering a promising opportunity for investors. Many Chinese stocks, especially the ones discussed in this piece, are deeply undervalued.\n\nHence, it\u2019s an excellent time to load up on them for the long haul. Moreover, as I discussed in a recent article, billionaire Ray Dalio recognizes the strength of Chinese markets. Dalio\u2019s endorsement of Chinese stocks underscores their appeal in an uncertain market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, investing in these three best Chinese stocks to buy would prove ideal for diversifying into this segment and building and balancing your investment portfolio. These stocks are growing at a healthy pace and are positioned for superb gains from their current prices.\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nMiniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) is a Chinese trailblazer in the low-cost retail space, with its massive global footprint and dynamic product portfolio. Consequently, it has grown its business at a superb pace, with sales growth exceeding 11% in the past five years. Perhaps what\u2019s more impressive is its EBITDA growth, which stands at 110% over the same period. Moreover, its trailing twelve-month (TTM) free cash flow per share stands at 89 cents, roughly 82% higher than in 2020.\n\nThe past two quarters have been excellent for the firm, marked by comfortable top- and bottom-line beats. Revenues have grown by more than 20% in the past few quarters as the firm continues aggressively pursuing its expansion strategy.\n\nThe low-cost retailer aims to open 400 new stores in China and more than 600 stores overseas. Moreover, it plans to open 900 to 1,100 new stores annually between 2024 and 2028, underscoring Miniso\u2019s commitment to broadening its global footprint and enhancing its market presence.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), often dubbed the \u201cGoogle of China,\u201d has solidified its position in AI and internet services. The firm has invested heavily in AI technologies that power its autonomous driving, voice recognition, and cloud services.\n\nMoreover, its sophisticated foundation model, ERNIE, is recognized as China\u2019s most powerful AI model. Back in April, ERNIE surpassed the 200 million user mark, underscoring Baidu\u2019s robust positioning in generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, in recent quarters, we\u2019ve seen a healthy bump in non-online marketing revenue, driven mainly by its burgeoning AI cloud business. Given the firm\u2019s investments in AI, I expect its cloud division to continue spearheading its operational results.\n\nFurthermore, its aggressive share buyback strategy shows Baidu\u2019s proactive approach to creating shareholder value. Since the beginning of Q1, the company has repurchased shares worth $229 million, bringing the total buyback amount to $898 million under its 2023 share repurchase program.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is a Chinese EV juggernaut that has proven resilient despite the headwinds weighing down the EV space. Consequently, its stock has been laggard this year, losing north of 8%. However, its long-term bull case remains firmly intact, making it an excellent buy at current prices.\n\nIt turned heads last year during the fourth-quarter (Q4), when it sped ahead of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in total cars sold. This massive breakthrough underscores BYD\u2019s dominance while setting the stage for healthy competition in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, BYD isn\u2019t just outpacing Tesla in deliveries; it\u2019s surpassing it across multiple fronts. Take, for instance, BYD\u2019s gross margins, which outshine Tesla\u2019s, standing at 21% versus Tesla\u2019s 18%. The gaps are much more pronounced with BYD\u2019s EBITDA growth, which is 71% compared to Tesla\u2019s -26%. These healthy profitability metrics are a testament to BYD\u2019s robust internal economics and the impressive sales that have propelled it to the top of the EV heap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

However, patterns may emerge if you follow the smart money for a while, and stocks that previously looked good can end up being duds in the future. Furthermore, some stocks on the path to recovery may post disappointing results that indicate a return to all-time highs is unlikely. These are some of the red-flagged stocks to avoid that the smart money is dumping.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been enduring a tough year. Shares are down by 42% year-to-date as growth has\u00a0stopped. Total revenue dropped by 9% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter\u00a0due to lower electric vehicle sales.\u00a0Although bullish investors treat Tesla like a tech company, automotive sales made up $17.4 billion of the car company\u2019s $21.3 billion in Q1 2024 revenue, or\u00a0roughly 82% of total revenue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGAAP net income dipped by 55% year-over-year as Tesla had to lower its prices to keep up with competitors, especially in China. Tesla is losing market share in this critical market as Chinese EV makers rise\u00a0to the occasion. Tesla stock has gained\u00a0over\u00a01,000% over the past five years and enjoyed a parabolic rise during the pandemic. However, a 51 P/E ratio is excessive for an automobile company\u00a0with\u00a0profit margins that resemble other car companies.\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) has been a\u00a0tough\u00a0hold for long-term investors.\u00a0Shares are down\u00a038% year-to-date and have shed 69% of their market value over the past five years. Short interest is surging for the stock as more investors want to profit from\u00a0its\u00a0decline.\n\nUdemy reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0first quarter while narrowing its losses from $44.5 million to $18.3 million. However, the company only reported a 4% year-over-year growth rate in monthly average buyers in the consumer segment. A low growth rate in this area suggests that revenue growth is limited. Guidance concedes this fact, as a $795 to $805 million revenue range for fiscal 2024 is only a 9.7% year-over-year growth rate from fiscal 2023 revenue of $729 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company relies too much on course discounts to generate sales.\u00a0Continuously using\u00a0discounts can cheapen the perceived quality of courses and result in less traction. Growth rates have been slowing down for years, and as it\u2019s still burning through cash, Udemy needs to\u00a0meaningfully\u00a0reaccelerate growth rates to justify its current stock price.\u00a0That doesn\u2019t seem to be happening.\n\nPeloton (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront. Peloton layoffs\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON) has been in free fall\u00a0since the pandemic ended. Many people bought Peloton bikes during lockdowns\u00a0to continue their workouts. However, the company amassed an excessive valuation as investors\u00a0became\u00a0too speculative without considering\u00a0whether\u00a0growth was sustainable.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Peloton\u2019s growth declined, but the fall has been quite dramatic. Shares are down by 42% year-to-date and are more than 95% removed from their all-time highs. The company is also losing top talent left and right. Three top instructors are\u00a0leaving the platform. Peloton has a revolving door of CEOs and has lost two so far.\n\nThe overpriced bikes and monthly subscription make the gym feel like a no-brainer if you had to choose between the two. Many consumers think that way and have been voting with their wallets. Peloton reported a 4% year-over-year revenue drop in the\u00a0first quarter,\u00a0losing 1% of its members year-over-year. A declining membership base, lower revenue and high net losses don\u2019t paint a good picture for long-term investors.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast.

As the global economy shifts to greener and more sustainable energy solutions, finding the best EV stocks to buy will be a strategic move.\n\nOne of the significant factors influencing the EV market is the interest rate environment. Lower interest rates can significantly impact the growth of the EV sector. They reduce the cost of borrowing for companies, making it much easier to invest in innovation.\n\nAdditionally, lower interest rates make it more affordable for consumers to finance vehicles, further accelerating their adoption. As consumer risk appetite and spending continue to rebound, EV stocks will become an attractive investment opportunity in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s explore the top three EV stocks to buy with lower interest rates in 2025!\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has revolutionized the automotive industry with its innovative electric vehicle (EV) platform and compelling vision for sustainable transportation. The company\u2019s robust growth trajectory and market dominance make it one of the top EV stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nTesla\u2019s success since the pandemic can be attributed to several key factors. First and foremost, the company is led by its legendary CEO, Elon Musk. Its commitment to innovation since its founding in 2003 is steadfast, constantly pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. From improving battery efficiency to developing the most advanced autonomous driving platform, Tesla is relentless in its pursuit of excellence. Its advancements in battery technology, particularly its development of the 4680 battery cell, are groundbreaking. This lithium-ion battery will significantly reduce production costs and increase vehicle range, making EVs more appealing to a broader audience. Additionally, the company is focused on scaling its production capacity, with gigafactories strategically located in the United States, Asia, and Europe. Although the company forecasts a decline in vehicle deliveries and gross margins in the 2024 fiscal year, its long-term growth outlook remains intact.\n\nFerrari NV (RACE) Ferarri car on the streets of France.\n\nSource: Hadrian / Shutterstock\n\nFerrari NV (NYSE:RACE), synonymous with luxury and high performance, is strategically pivoting toward the luxury EV market. In 2025, Ferrari plans to launch its first fully electric vehicle, which could attract a new audience of environmentally conscious luxury car buyers.\n\nFerrari\u2019s entry into the EV market is driven by regulatory pressures and a desire to stay ahead of industry trends. Led by its visionary CEO, Bennedeto Vigna, he emphasizes that Ferrari\u2019s approach to electrification is focusing on the brand\u2019s unique driving experience. The company\u2019s focus on quality craftsmanship and strong brand recognition make it well-positioned to fill the gap and create the most premium EV driving experience. Moreover, its incredible financial results over the last several years make the company even more appealing. In FY23, revenue increased 17% year-over-year to a record $5.97 billion. Net earnings surpassed $1 billion for the first time, with the company also generating a record free cash flow of $1.33 billion. Its margins have also remained exceptionally strong, and management has forecasted double-digit revenue and earnings growth in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) AI. Circuit board.

As a leading provider of semiconductor solutions, ON Semiconductor is crucial in enabling the development and deployment of EVs worldwide.\n\nON Semiconductor\u2019s products are integral to various aspects of EVs, including power management, battery charging, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The company\u2019s expertise in silicon carbide (SiC) modules is essential for enhancing the efficiency and performance of EVs. These materials offer superior electrical properties and are key to powering EVs. ON Semi has remained extremely resilient despite the broad slowdown across these industries. Despite slowing growth in 2023, management is relentless in expanding its production capacity. This includes its recent $2 billion investment in the Czech Republic and its expansion of its SiC production facility in Bucheron, South Korea. With interest rates anticipated to come down going into 2025, ON stock is among the top EV stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Ideally, you'd want to buy them near the bottom of a recession when their prices are lower, anticipating a recovery and rising consumer spending. Essentially, owning consumer cyclical stocks is a bet that the economy will be growing in the near future. This is in contrast to consumer staples, or consumer defensive, stocks which allow investors to position their portfolio to hedge losses in the case of an economic downturn.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are riskier than their defensive counterparts, they offer higher returns and also come with the corresponding increase in risk. Additionally, while determining the risk of consumer defensive stocks might be relatively easy and off the bat calculations can be used, conducting the same exercise for cyclical stocks is trickier. Investors determine a stock's risk by calculating its beta (\u03b2), which measures the tendency of a stock to move with the broader market. Stocks with a \u03b2 greater than one are more volatile, those with a \u03b2 less than one are less volatile, and a few (like gold mining stocks) can even have a negative \u03b2 that makes their share prices move in opposition to the market.\n\nSo why is measuring the risk of cyclical stocks tricky? Well, research shows that investors can either rely on a 'reasonable' \u03b2 estimate of 0.7 for defensive stocks or narrow them down by stock sector to define a \u03b2 that ranges between 0.6 to 0.8. On the flip side, similar shortcuts are unadvised for calculating the \u03b2 for consumer cyclical stocks. To determine the risk of these stocks, a case by case approach that takes into account the earnings volatility of a firm and the overall business model is recommended.\n\nBuilding on this, consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle for their performance. In fact, data shows that if you're able to time the business cycle, then investing in consumer staples stocks can provide an opportunity to lead all other market sectors in terms of return. The business cycle is broadly divided into four phases, the early, mid, late, and recession phases. Each phase is marked by unique economic characteristics, and research shows that consumer cyclical stocks perform the best during the first phase. This phase marks the start of a new business cycle after the previous cycle's recession phase has ended, and its biggest traits are low interest rates and an uptick in economic activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearch shows that the first phase of the business cycle is the one that features the highest sector differentiated performance, with the difference between returns spreading to 25 percentage points. The stocks that lead the returns in this period are consumer cyclical stocks since lower interest rates and an uptick in economic activity allow consumers to have higher discretionary spending and enable businesses to expand operations through easy credit. The 'hit rate' (which measures the percentage of time periods in the business cycle periods in different cycles over time where the sector outperformed) of cyclical stocks during the early phase is 100%, which ties in with the performance of consumer staples in the late stage among all seven stock market sector performance across all phases of the business cycle. In terms of average returns, consumer cyclical stocks return roughly 12% as a category, implying that individual stocks will offer higher returns as the data is influenced by outliers to a large extent.\n\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on business cycles to a large extent and also rely on robust consumer spending, the next step in analyzing their performance is to see how spending varies within the cycle. Estimating what stage of the business cycle we're in is a tricky process, and analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley have tried to do so. Their research shows that we are currently in the downturn phase of the cycle, which precedes the early stage we've talked about above. We can also try to determine the business cycle's stage ourselves. Right now, inflation is still trending above trend in America (2.6% PCE in May vs 2% preferred), first quarter GDP growth slowed down (1.6% in Q1 from 3.4% in Q4 2023), and inventories at retailers jumped by 1% annually in February. These three metrics suggest that we might be in the late stage of the business cycle which typically precedes a recession. Consumer spending slows down in the late stages of the business cycles, the downturn and the recession, and neither cycle stage bodes well for consumer cyclical stocks. A key indicator of consumer spending is consumer confidence as it indicates future economic perceptions. On this front, US consumer confidence in March, April, May, and June stood at 103.1, 97, 101.3, and 100.4, respectively. A lower value signals lower confidence, and a value under 80 can signal a recession.\n\nTopping our analysis, let's take a look at how consumer cyclical stocks have recently fared to check whether the conclusions we've reached above are supported by stock market performance. As a refresher, 2024 has been characterized by investors pushing forward interest rate cut expectations and seeking shelter in a few stocks characterized by their strong exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. Two of the most popular consumer staples and defensive stock indexes are those managed by the S&P. Looking at their performance over the past twelve months, these are up by 14.8% and 5.8%, respectively. This is unsurprising since the US GDP has defied expectations during this time period, as it grew by 4.9% and 3.4% in Q3 and Q4 2023 and beat analyst expectations.\n\nHowever, Q1 2024 GDP growth slowed down to 1.6%, which not only missed analyst estimates of 2.4% but also came with some rather ill-boding expectations for consumer cyclical stocks as spending growth slowed down from its 3.3% growth in the previous quarter to 2.5% in Q1. This figure also sat well below Wall Street's 3% estimate. The data was released in April, and the previous release which saw the 0.4% inflation reading for March outdo analyst estimates triggered a 6% drop in the consumer cyclical stock index over the next nine days. Since then, the index has gained 6.57%.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select the best consumer cyclical stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 biggest consumer cyclical stocks in terms of market capitalization stocks by the number of hedge funds that had held a stake in them during Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 74\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s primary business is manufacturing and selling electric cars. Along with this, it also sells energy storage equipment, provides semi autonomous driving software, and is focused on high growth industries such as robotics. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s reliance on EVs as its bread and butter means that the firm, like other consumer cyclical stocks, is at the mercy of economic trends. EVs are not cheap products, and easy consumer access to financing allows them to easily buy Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s cars. The firm is also dependent on the global lithium supply chain and prices for its financial well being, and any supply disruptions that lead to rapid price increases end up hurting Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s margins. It is also competing in the highly cutthroat Chinese market, where the threat of competition has forced it to reduce margins by lowering prices right when lithium prices are high, costs are rising, and access to financing is tough. However, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) enjoys considerable advantages over other EV companies because of its strong manufacturing model, and a major catalyst should be the highly anticipated cheaper EV that could spur demand.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nTesla\u2019s narrative wasn\u2019t just about being a great electric vehicle manufacturer. The way we see it, the narrative included Tesla becoming a fully autonomous fleet of electric vehicles (\u201cRobotaxi\u201d) soon, the charging platform for all E.V.s soon, an AI play, a global solar utility company soon, a future subscription business, a more. When we research Tesla, we see a differentiated auto business and the potential for many of these interesting \u201coptions\u201d to be realized over a long enough period. However, the timing and true viability of many of these options are still unknown and often take much longer than many hope. To justify today\u2019s valuation, even after the recent pullback, we see a company that needs to crack the mass market with a $25,000 or less model at acceptable margins. Yet, the company hasn\u2019t articulated a clear path to getting there. Interest rates have risen, and competition in China has intensified, tempering demand for its existing, higher- priced cars. Valuation has become more difficult to justify at these levels. We feel the reality of these dynamics has finally started to settle into Tesla stock prices, and we look forward to seeing a more reasonable valuation that reflects the existing product portfolio and any future offerings that demonstrate a very clear path to near-term commercialization.\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 8th on our list of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy.

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. reported its second consecutive drop in quarterly deliveries, though Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk took measures to stem the decline.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Powerful Hurricane Beryl Aims at Jamaica After Grenada Strike Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely \u2018Upflation\u2019 Is the New Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Seeks to Toss NY Felony Conviction After Immunity Win\n\nThe carmaker said Tuesday that it delivered 443,956 vehicles in the second quarter, better than the 439,302 average analyst estimate. While sales were down 4.8% from a year ago, Tesla improved on a sequential basis from the 386,810 vehicles delivered in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe company produced 410,831 vehicles during the quarter. Its shares climbed as much as 4.8% before the start of regular trading.\n\nTesla has had a tumultuous year. Musk announced major staff reductions in April and pushed internally to reduce headcount by as much as a 20%. The job losses have included sales employees, which may have played a role in weaker sales figures. The EV maker\u2019s first new model in years, the Cybertruck, also has been slow to ramp up.\n\nTesla blamed its first quarter slowdown on a suspected arson attack at its vehicle factory near Berlin, as well as shipping diversions from the Red Sea. While there were fewer external disruptions to the business during the last three months, the company is struggling to grow with an older lineup of vehicles.\n\nMusk ordered price cuts across Tesla\u2019s lineup over the past year and a half, but those measures haven\u2019t done enough to sustain momentum. The Austin-based carmaker delivered 422,405 of its top-selling Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the second quarter, down from 446,915 a year ago.\n\nThe company still hasn\u2019t broken out sales for the Cybertruck, the pickup that it began delivering late last year. Two recall campaigns in June suggested Tesla has handed over more than 11,000 of the trucks to customers. During the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last month, Musk said the automaker had produced 1,300 of the pickups in a week, though he didn\u2019t specify when or speak to whether Tesla would maintain that pace.\n\nMusk has said Tesla will roll out new and more affordable models by early next year, though the company has provided few details beyond saying they\u2019ll be produced on the same manufacturing lines as its current lineup. The CEO has also prioritized building a fully autonomous robotaxi and plans to hold an event to unveil the vehicle on Aug. 8.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped roughly 5% in early trading Tuesday after the EV giant reported quarterly vehicle deliveries that beat Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe EV giant delivered 443,956 vehicles during the second quarter, versus an analyst consensus estimate of 439,302 deliveries, per Bloomberg data.\n\n\u201cIn the second quarter, we produced approximately 411,000 vehicles and delivered approximately 444,000 vehicles,\u201d read a company statement. Broken down by car type, Tesla said it delivered 422,405 models 3/Y, and 21,551 other models.\n\nThat second quarter total delivery figure is higher than the 386,810 vehicles globally delivered in the first quarter but lower than the approximate 466,140 delivered a year ago.\n\nThe company has faced stiff competition abroad from its Chinese counterparts amid a waning market for EVs. In an effort to reduce costs, Tesla embarked on a plan to cut more than 10% of its global staff earlier this year in what some analysts saw as a signal of tough times ahead.\n\nDuring Tesla's shareholder meeting last month CEO Elon Musk confirmed that near-term demand and sales will still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Musk said with regard to the EV market, adding that competitors have also been scaling back their investments and production of electric vehicles.\n\nAhead of the delivery numbers on Monday, Wells Fargo analysts noted the company\u2019s gross margin will likely be impacted amid a crowded market.

Last month Tesla announced its fourth Cybertruck recall since the vehicle\u2019s release late last year. Within the recall notice, 11,688 trucks appeared to be affected.\n\nAhead of the deliveries print, Tesla shares had gained more than 6% on Monday as Chinese peers Li Auto (LI) and Nio (NIO) and XPeng (XPEV) reported better than expected deliveries.\n\nTesla shares have rallied roughly 50% since their 52-week low on April 22.

        "content": "Within the technology sector, a few companies are beginning to emerge as future titans. Based on their growth potency, they can be valued at trillions of dollars in the foreseeable future. Three companies are about to become members of the elite trillion-dollar club. These companies currently dominate trillions of AI, semiconductors, and energy markets.\n\nTo be specific, these companies lead the semiconductor and automobile manufacturing industries. They also have cutting-edge tech advancements, solid financial performance, and strategic expansion. Moreover, their expertise in high-performance computing, control over the production of sophisticated semiconductors, and diversification into AI-driven and energy-storage technologies demonstrate several routes to significant market capitalization.\n\nHere, the focus is on these firms\u2019 core financial measures, technical innovations, and strategic objectives to understand what makes them unique and why their journey toward future trillion-dollar companies is\u00a0an important trend to observe in the prevailing adverse macro conditions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) An AMD sign on a CPU package. AMD Stock\n\nSource: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads the production of high-performance computing components. In the first quarter, the company\u2019s top-line increased by 2% from a year ago to $5.5 billion. A considerable lead in the data center and client segments against reductions in the gaming and embedded segments became the driving force behind this top-line boost. The revenue distribution demonstrates AMD\u2019s capacity to profit from rapidly expanding markets with a record quarterly Data Center sales of $2.3 billion. Thus, the Data Center segment outperformed the prior year by 80%.\n\nMoreover, there was a\u00a02% sequential growth in the data center category as well. Over 40% of AMD\u2019s total revenue came from its data center division. This\u00a0highlights this division\u2019s vital significance in the company\u2019s portfolio. This gain\u00a0was driven\u00a0by the ramp up of AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs and a notable increase in server CPU sales. Revenue in the client sector increased by 85% in the last year to $1.4 billion. Hence, this expansion was further supported by introducing the Ryzen Pro 8000 series.\n\nOverall, AMD\u2019s presence on the future trillion-dollar companies list\u00a0is supported\u00a0by record revenue from leveraging high-growth markets.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan SemiconductorManufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing with advanced process technologies. The company had a decline in sales in the first quarter, with the top line down 3.8%. There were seasonal fluctuations in the smartphone market that are partly to blame for this reduction. Meanwhile, demand for high-performance computing components remained relatively stable. The company lifted its gross margin by 0.1 percentage points to 53.1% despite this considerable decline in top line. Indeed, adjustments to the product mix due to the seasonality of smartphones led to this margin improvement.\n\nFurther, they were vital when TSMC\u2019s sophisticated process technologies were broken down by technology-based revenue. The 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer processes accounted for\u00a037% and 19% of wafer sales. Meanwhile, the 3-nanometer process technology contributed 9% to wafer revenue. The company\u2019s expertise and lead in advanced semiconductor production reflect\u00a0that technologies with a combined size of 7 nanometers or less accounted for 65% of the total wafer sales.\n\nTSMC\u2019s\u00a0strong gross\u00a0margin and cost management solidify its place on the list of future trillion-dollar companies.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is revolutionizing the automotive industry with electric vehicles. The company also excels in energy storage solutions. Tesla\u2019s energy storage deployments, especially with the Megapack, hit a record high in the first quarter.\n\nTesla\u2019s energy margins hit a record of 24.6%. In Q1, Tesla\u2019s AI training computed more than doubled. This expansion of the AI infrastructure includes the activation of around 35K H100 units. There are plans to grow them to about\u00a085K by the end of the year. Indeed, this growth accelerates the development of autonomous driving technologies. Tesla is introducing new car models more quickly than anticipated. Production is anticipated to begin late this year or early 2025. Therefore, with this strategy, Tesla should be able to produce more than 3 million cars annually.\n\nThe record deployment of Megapacks and the doubling of AI training compute capacity reflect Tesla\u2019s diversified revenue streams, solidifying its position on the future trillion-dollar companies list.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD and TSM.

        "content": "When deciding which stocks to invest in, understanding which exchanges they are listed on can make a big difference in long-term performance and perception. For most U.S.-based investors, the two exchanges they hear about the most are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. The NYSE is known for its relative stability and historically blue-chip stocks. On the other hand, the Nasdaq is a staple of high-growth and more speculative ventures like information technology, biotechnology and market disruptors. Yet, due to this reputation, Nasdaq stocks tend to be more volatile over short periods, leading to some Nasdaq stocks to sell.\n\nIn the case of these three companies, both broader market pressures and institutional overvaluations have put them in positions worth selling from. Furthermore, these companies may be at the end of their speculative roads, leading investors to want more growth where there may not be any left.\n\nBioNTech (BNTX) The headquarters of BioNTech (BNTX) in Germany.\n\nSource: Palatinate Stock / Shutterstock.com\n\nA product of the COVID-19 pandemic, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) has been steadily losing value ever since its meteoric spike from developing a vaccine alongside Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The best time to have sold would have been back in 2021 to take advantage of its extreme overvaluation at the time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToday, the company focuses on utilizing the mRNA drug delivery platform to treat cancer and has several such fully-owned drugs in the pipeline for diseases like melanoma and head and neck cancer. The company also deeply invests in its collaborative efforts for protein-based cancer therapies as well. While these goals may be admirable, they are not likely to take BNTX stock back up to the $350 range it was trading at during the height of the pandemic.\n\nRather, BNTX now represents a respectable biotech stock that has more modest long-term growth potential. That said, its current price still needs some correction as its lack of profitability and revenue growth could begin to turn investors away.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce touted as a symbol of American capitalism, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) may struggle to find its footing in an ever-financially savvy consumer market. Americans are more focused on saving money where they can as the dollar loses power due to inflation and the cost of essentials like housing and food are at all-time highs.\n\nThus, the business model of selling overpriced coffee may be going out of fashion, especially as coffee culture in the U.S. grows and encourages people to take brewing into their own hands. Yet, it\u2019s not just less consumer spending that could damage SBUX stock\u2019s long-term trajectory. Recently, both efforts to unionize amongst its workers and the rising cost of minimum wage in the U.S. are likely to cut into its profit margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nPair these factors with an ultimately non-essential product, and SBUX may be one of the Nasdaq stocks to sell before it continues to lose its value.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing bearish on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not contrarian; it\u2019s rational. That\u2019s because the company\u2019s current valuation stems from an overall misconception about its purpose. For the better part of a decade, many investors treated Tesla as a technology company that happened to test and market that technology through its cars. However, the reality and market dynamics of the auto industry are starting to catch up with TSLA stock.\n\nFor starters, its cars are still simply too expensive for the average American to afford. Consider the metric that 28% of Americans don\u2019t even have $1,000 in cash savings. This means one of Tesla\u2019s primary markets remains so financially burdened that it cannot afford the price of a new electric vehicle. Then consider the impracticality of Tesla vehicles across the majority of U.S. states which are so large that charging and range anxiety become an issue.\n\nThe combination of these practical factors alongside the fact that hybrid engines are a more pragmatic approach to cleaner transportation is likely to continue whittling away at TSLA\u2019s share value. As such, Elon Musk\u2019s foray into the auto industry might result in one of the best Nasdaq stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "A conscious shift towards the adoption of sustainable electric vehicle technology has been a boon for the best EV charging stocks on the market.\n\nThe dawn of the electric car has revolutionized the automotive industry as we know it. Effortless acceleration coupled with savvy user-interfaces has made driving EVs an exciting endeavor. Add on the positive effects of decarbonization with fossil fuel alternatives \u2014 and the growth potential of these vehicles remains endless.\n\nWhile EVs offer several use cases and utility, one key driver of its adoption is the presence of proper infrastructure. Namely EV charging stations. These stations play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless access to power, thus supporting the growth of electric vehicles on the road.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe commitment to encouraging the use of more \u2018clean cars\u2019 has led to significant increase in the presence of EV charging stations. This has served as a major tailwind for companies responsible for the deployment of these stations.\n\nAs the adoption of electric cars continues to grow, EV charging companies are poised for outsized returns.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCalifornia-based ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) leads the EV charging market with its vast network of stations and unique product offering. Unlike traditional power supply businesses, the company uses a subscription-based model to help businesses customize their EV charging needs.\n\nChargePoint as a Service is a cloud-based offering that offers a flexible option for EV charging. This all-in-one solution includes everything a user will need to manage a fleet of commercial or personal electric vehicles. Drivers, on the other hand, can control the charging of their vehicles from a mobile app. This high-utility offering has made ChargePoint a dominant force in the global EV market.\n\nNow on the surface, the company certainly has a good story to tell. After all, it played a key role in the early adoption of electric-vehicles. However, it\u2019s worth pointing out that ChargePoint has been affected by the cool down in EV purchases. This was evident in its recent earnings report with revenue down 18% from last year.\n\nNevertheless, as macroeconomic conditions in the market improve, CHPT is one of the best EV charging stocks for long term returns. Its fundamentals continue to remain strong and with the stock down 10.12% in June, this is a great entry point.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a sea of EV-makers, RivianAutomotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a reigning favorite for several reasons. The company faced a rocky start, plagued by high production costs and unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the carmaker successfully overcame these headwinds to emerge as a leader in the space.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs an electric pick-up manufacturer, Rivian was able to carve out a niche in a market dominated by automotive juggernauts, GM (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NASDAQ:FORD). Since then, it has seen impressive gains with strong delivery numbers and demand for its vehicles. The company recently attracted a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) that sent its stock price soaring 50% in the after hours.\n\nNow while the company\u2019s EV numbers are impressive, its EV charging initiatives are just as noteworthy. Rivian\u2019s \u2018Adventure Network\u2019 (RAN) is a network of 424 DC chargers available across 70 locations in the U.S. While the stations are typically exclusive to Rivian\u2019s customers, the company recently announced it is now compatible with Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) network. This will enable the company to expand its EV footprint while creating a more collaborative charging ecosystem.\n\nRivian\u2019s strong market position and growing charging ecosystem makes it one of the best EV charging stocks to buy now.\n\nNio (NIO) Retail display of NIO store at night. NIO is a Chinese electric car brand\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nA third company that\u2019s making waves in the EV charging market is Nio (NYSE:NIO). Known primarily for its electric cars, Nio is actively developing its charging infrastructure with EV battery swap technology. If you are unfamiliar with the jargon, battery swap stations let cars swap out empty batteries with fully charged ones.\n\nKeeping with this commitment, the company announced a partnership with several Chinese automakers to expand its battery swap network across China. A total of 2,300 swap stations have been installed with plans to build a 1,000 more this year. The growth of its charging station network will eventually translate for a higher demand for EVs.\n\nNow coming to the stock\u2019s performance, a cooling demand for EVs has pushed shares lower in recent months. Adding fuel to the fire is geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and EU with higher tariffs on Chinese EV imports. But despite the headwinds, a recent uptick in May vehicle deliveries has re-instilled investor confidence to a degree.\n\nAnalysts also remain cautiously bullish on NIO stock giving it a price upside of $6.19. The stock is currently trading around $4.44.\n\nNio is among the best EV charging stocks to consider for its expanding charging infrastructure and EV technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

(ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nEV maker Tesla saw its shares gain around 6% on Monday, but was lower in premarket the following day, as investors look to its quarterly production and delivery report later on.\n\nWall Street brokerage Wells Fargo added the stock to its \"tactical ideas\" watch list ahead of the data, but kept it at an \"underweight\" rating as other companies close in on the EV market in key territories.\n\nChina's BYD (1211.HK), for example, said it had seen a 21% rise in second-quarter electric vehicle sales, selling 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to a Reuters report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week, Tesla said that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets fall as traders await eurozone inflation data\n\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall \u2014 11,688 trucks \u2014 which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMeta stock barely wobbled after news of new regulatory challenges in Europe, as the European Commission circled its wagons to implement new digital markets laws.\n\nThe Commission said Instagram's \"pay or consent\" advertising model, where users must either consent to personalised ads or pay to remove them, is in breach of its laws.

But the stock price quickly crashed lower after market open. On Tuesday, it looks set to stage a slight recovery when the market opens, with stock up around 1.8% in premarket.\n\nRyan Cohen \u2014 CEO of GameStop (GME), another memestock \u2014 is also the Chewy founder.\n\nSainsbury's (SBRY.L)\n\nUK grocer Sainsbury's said it had seen \"sustained grocery momentum\" in its first quarter, despite poor weather conditions.\n\nThe chain reported a 3% rise in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to 22 June. This figure strips out the closure of its Argos business in Ireland.\n\nTotal grocery sales were 4.8% higher as the firm saw robust growth by volume. However, this was the slowest growth seen for many quarters as food inflation has fallen back significantly.\n\nEven with seemingly positive numbers, its stock price took a knock in early trade on Tuesday, down around 3.6% shortly after the open.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with our market-beating grocery performance and the early progress we\u2019re making against our Next Level Sainsbury's plan,\" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's CEO. \"We\u2019ve been winning from competitors every month for 15 months, as more and more people are choosing Sainsbury's for their big weekly shop.\"\n\nRead more: Shop price inflation at lowest point since October 2021\n\nSainsbury\u2019s has been struggling to differentiate itself from rivals with stiff competition on price from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl while its premium ranges fall short of those on offer at Waitrose and Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), noted Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.\n\n\"Nonetheless Sainsbury\u2019s continues to make headway in growing its market share versus rivals with potential for further growth as inflation pressures subsides, a boost from the summer sun that has only recently appeared, and the excitement around the Euros,\" she said.\n\n\"Sainsbury\u2019s was able to keep its full-year guidance unchanged for underlying operating profit of \u00a31.01bn and \u00a31.06bn representing growth of between 5% and 10%.\"\n\nWatch: EV demand, investing in AI, jobs data: Asking for a Trend<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/josh-lipton/\\\">Josh Lipton</a> breaks down the biggest takeaways from Monday's trading session.</p>\\n<p>Car manufacturers like General Motors (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM\\\">GM</a>) and Ford (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F\\\">F</a>) have scaled back their electric vehicle production plans amid weaker consumer demand.

Shipments were down 2.2% on May.\n\nThe drop comes ahead of closely watched global second-quarter production and delivery figures for Tesla, due later on Tuesday in the US.

Li Auto Inc. delivered 47,774 cars, mainly thanks to strong traction from its recently unveiled extended-range electric five-seater L6 model.\n\nNio Inc. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.\u2019s Zeekr brand both delivered record highs as well, each with monthly sales of more than 20,000 cars.\n\nChina announced a one-off subsidy of as much as 10,000 yuan ($1,400) in April to consumers who trade in their old vehicles and buy a newer model that meets certain emissions standards, and there have been additional incentives from various local municipalities. That\u2019s fueled consumers\u2019 willingness to buy a new car and helped temporarily stabilize car prices, PCA said.\n\nPCA didn\u2019t break down Tesla\u2019s domestic sales versus its exports in the preliminary data, but the US automaker typically focuses more on local deliveries in the last month of each quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China's BYD posted a 21% rise in second-quarter electric vehicle sales, closing the gap with Tesla after handing back the world's top EV vendor title to the U.S. rival in the first quarter.\n\nBYD sold 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to Reuters' calculations based on its monthly sales reports. That's around 12,000 vehicles fewer than Tesla's vehicle deliveries estimated for the second quarter.\n\nTesla is expected to report a 6% drop in April-June quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, the first time the U.S. firm is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.\n\nThe company may again cede its EV championship to BYD if the actual results turn out to be softer than estimated, with Barclays predicting an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever.\n\nTesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be \"notably lower\" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.\n\nThe EV maker has cut output of its best-selling Model Y electric car by a double-digit percentage number at its Shanghai plant since March to address weakening demand for its aged models in China, its second-largest market after the United States, Reuters reported in May.\n\nBy comparison, its top Chinese competitor BYD maintained steady growth in EV sales, while EV upstarts such as Nio reported stellar growth last quarter. NIO's vehicle deliveries in the second quarter more than doubled to 57,300 units.\n\nPrice cuts and a growing shift in consumer demand to EVs and hybrids from gasoline-powered vehicles are the main reasons behind Chinese EV makers' strong sales in recent months, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).\n\nSales of new energy vehicles including EVs and plug-in hybrids in China made up 46.7% of total car sales in May, a fresh monthly high, as per CPCA data.\n\n(Reporting by Qiaoyi Li, Zhang Yan and Kevin Krolicki; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge down as investors prepare for incoming labor market data during a holiday-shortened trading week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak at an European Central Bank event, with the Fed's potential interest rate path for the rest of the year in focus. Elsewhere, U.S. federal prosecutors are reportedly awaiting a decision from Boeing (NYSE:BA) on a plea deal to settle charges linked to two fatal crashes.\n\n1. Futures lower\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed lower on Tuesday after the main averages on Wall Street rose in light pre-holiday trading in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:19 ET (07:19 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 96 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 17 points or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 83 points or 0.4%.\n\nAll three of the indices finished higher on Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite boosted in particular by a jump in Big Tech names like electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and iPhone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Trading volumes were relatively muted as equity markets prepared to shutter for the U.S. Independence Day holiday on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, investors remained focused on the release of key U.S. labor market data this week, including job openings figures on Tuesday and the monthly non-farm payrolls report on Friday. The numbers could factor into how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate cuts later this year.\n\n2. Powell to speak at Sintra\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is set to participate in a panel at a European Central Bank conference in Sintra on Tuesday, with markets keen to see if he will provide any new cues on interest rates.\n\nPowell's comments will serve as a precursor to the publication of minutes from the Fed's June policy gathering on Wednesday, when the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) signaled that it only expects to reduce borrowing costs once this year -- down from three in March.\n\nYet traders, buoyed by hopes for a continued cooling in U.S. inflation, are still betting the Fed will roll out roughly two cuts in 2024 beginning in September, according CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) closely-monitored FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"There has been a tendency from Powell to be a bit more optimistic than the FOMC consensus on disinflation, and we think there are some downside risks for the dollar ahead of today\u2019s speech,\" analysts at ING said in a note.\n\n3. Federal prosecutors awaiting Boeing decision on plea deal - AP\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department is waiting for Boeing to accept a plea deal to settle felony fraud charges related to two fatal crashes of its 737 Max planes, according to the Associated Press.\n\nStory continues\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the AP said Boeing has until the end of the week to either accept or reject the offer, which would also see the company agree to independent monitoring for compliance with anti-fraud laws.\n\nThe proposal stems from a Justice Department finding earlier this year that Boeing had misled regulators who had approved the 737 Max, violating the terms of a 2021 agreement shielding the firm from prosecution over deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nWhile accepting the deal would save Boeing from a potentially bruising courtroom battle, it threatens to cloud over its ongoing attempt to move beyond a dangerous mid-air panel blowout in January on one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines.\n\n4. Billionaire Barry Diller eyeing possible Paramount bid - NYT\n\nBillionaire Barry Diller is considering a bid to take over Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) after the studio he formerly led pulled out of a merger with Skydance Media, the New York Times reported on Monday.\n\nDiller\u2019s media conglomerate IAC signed nondisclosure agreements with National Amusements, Paramount\u2019s controlling shareholder, the NYT report said, citing people close to the matter. A nondisclosure agreement usually precedes negotiations over a deal.\n\nThe NDAs were also signed sometime after deal talks between Paramount and Skydance fell through earlier in the year, the NYT report said.\n\nDiller had bid for Paramount in the early 1990's, but was outbid by Sumner Redstone, whose daughter Shari now controls the studio. Diller had also led the studio in the 1970's and 80's, and was credited with reviving it through several popular projects.\n\nParamount is the parent company of several major networks, including CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon. The firm has engaged in sale talks with several potential suitors over the past year, but none have so far borne fruit.\n\n5. Crude hovering near two-month highs\n\nCrude prices inched up on Tuesday, holding near two-month highs on expectations for rising fuel demand during the U.S. summer.\n\nBy 03:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) had gained 0.1% to $83.42 a barrel, while the Brent contract had climbed 0.1% to $86.71 per barrel. Both benchmarks touched to their highest levels since the end of April during the previous session.\n\nGasoline demand in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, is expected to ramp up as the summer travel season gathers steam due to the Independence Day holiday.\n\nTraders will also be looking at the latest data on U.S. crude stockpiles from the industry body American Petroleum Institute later in the session, as well as possible disruptions from Hurricane Beryl on U.S. oil refining and offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures lower, Fed's Powell to speak, Boeing plea deal - what's moving markets\n\nSri Lanka to save $5 billion after bilateral debt rework, president says\n\nECB's next rate cut an easy decision before choices become hard, Wunsch says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years According to Cathie Wood?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other stocks.\n\nAs the saying goes, time and tide wait for nobody. This also holds true for Wall Street, where not only are fortunes made in a blink of an eye, but things can take a 180 degree turn the next moment. The same appears to be true for Cathie Wood of Ark Investment. While most hedge funds focus on creating balanced portfolios that seek to leverage all kinds of stocks, Wood's firm chooses to focus exclusively on high growth sectors that it believes will disrupt the future. Wood is one of Tesla's biggest bulls, and her insights have proven to be correct as the electric vehicle maker has defied all predictions of doom and gloom and managed to deliver hundreds of thousands of vehicles globally.\n\nSince Insider Monkey tracks hedge fund data and investments to provide readers with the best stock picks, we've been following Wood for quite some time now. We took a look at her long term stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold For 5 Years According To ARK\u2019s Cathie Wood in 2021. Back then, Wood was a celebrity as her high-profile bets on the technology industry were paying off as the sector surged due to the booming demand in tech resulting from lock downs and stay at home mandates. Wood's fund returned 20% in 2020, and it led to a long interview with Bloomberg. In this talk, she stressed that Ark's investment horizon was five years, so any temporary corrections left her unfazed since the firm was in for the long haul. She added that while big ticket technology names were good stocks, the goal of her firm was to identify the next FANGs (now FAANG), and one sector that was ripe for growth was the DNA sector. Other sectors that she highlighted were ripe for growth in 2021 were artificial intelligence, energy storage, robotics, and blockchain.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, let's see how her top stocks have performed since then. Focusing exclusively on her top ten stocks back then and as of the first quarter of this year, only four stocks remain on the list. The rest have either been relegated to lower weights in the portfolio or have been eliminated altogether. The four stocks that remain have displayed mixed performance since the start of 2021. The worst performer has lost 86% since then, while the others are down by 73% to 39%. However, since these stocks are nevertheless still a part of Ark's portfolio, it's clear that Wood's is convinced of their potential to disrupt the market and is holding on to them with this belief.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the stocks that were eliminated, several of these have bled more than 80% since then, while one has lost all of its value and been de listed from the NASDAQ exchange. Other stocks have also lost more than 90% of their value since 2021, and given that these belong to sectors such as telehealth and online education, it's understandable since these sectors posted unbelievable gains during the era of lock downs but failed to retain investor interest once the situation normalized. Finally, none of the stocks that were part of Cathie Wood's top stocks in 2021 have posted returns since then.\n\nShifting gears, investing in 2024 has seen the stock market divided into technology and non technology sectors. Even within the former, it's mainly artificial intelligence and associated stocks that have delivered strong returns. So, Wood, whose firm targets high growth and disruptive stocks, has continued to struggle this year too. Ark Invest's flagship ARKK fund is down 16.7% year to date, while tech heavy stock indexes are up by almost 20%. Disruptive companies require easy credit and robust business spending -\u00a0 both of which struggle in a high interest rate environment.\n\nHowever, not all of Cathie Wood's 2024 stock picks have suffered. Some of the strongest performers belong to social media, cloud-based advertising, financial services, molecular testing, and counter terrorism data analytics services. These stocks are up by 48%, 36%, 83%, 76%, and 52% year to date. On the flip side, some sectors that have struggled are biotechnology and software as a service (SaaS). Cathie Wood's biotechnology stocks have lost anywhere between 86% to 64%, while her SaaS pick has bled 58%.\n\nThe last couple of years have been hard for growth stocks that are not part of the booming semiconductor industry. This is because of high interest rates, which not only damped investor risk appetite but also made it difficult for these firms to invest in growth. Since Wood is a pure play growth investor at heart, it's unsurprising that her stocks have also suffered during this period. Ark's latest investment portfolio was worth $14.4 billion as of March 2024 end, and given that some investors are optimistic that the Fed might finally start to cut interest rates soon, we decided to do a follow up piece and take a look at the top Cathie Wood stocks during Q4 2020 and see how they have performed since then. When reading about these stocks, readers are also advised to remember that the market of 2024 is a complete 180 degrees from the market of 2020 as back then interest rates were low and Internet and personal computing stocks were booming.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best Cathie Wood stocks to buy and hold for five years, we scanned her Q4 2020 SEC filings and picked out the top ten stocks in which her firm had invested the most. Then, their performance since then was evaluated.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nArk Investment's Q4 2020 Investment Stake: $2.9 billion\n\nNumber of Q1 2024 Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nShare Price Performance Since 2020 End: -15.87%\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of Cathie Wood's favorite stocks. It is the world's largest pure play electric vehicle manufacturer, and along with making cars, the firm has a host of other products such as self driving, energy storage, and even robotics to target high growth industries. Yet, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s bread and butter are electric cars, and any turbulence in this market means that the stock ends up struggling. The past 12 month have been hard for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), as higher costs, supply chain problems, and growing competition in the cut throat Chinese electric market have weighed on investors' minds. However, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) possesses key competitive advantages on the design and manufacturing fronts which enable it to utilize economies of scale to bring down costs and compete globally. Additionally, Chinese EVs have been recently the subject of tariffs in the EU, leaving the market open for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Another catalyst to the stock can be the much awaited sub $25,000 electric vehicle, which when coupled with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s brand name could lead to a higher market share and allow it to solve the key problem of EVs being too expensive for mass adoption.\n\nHaving first bought the shares in 2016 when they were trading at roughly $16, Ark Invest was out with a bullish take on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in June 2024. It shared that the launch of the Robotaxi could account for 90% of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s enterprise value by 2029 and electric vehicles could account for a quarter of revenue. Ark's updated model shows a bear case share price target of $2,000 per share and a bull share price of $3,100. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nTesla, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Shares fell 29.3% in the first quarter as the core automotive segment is facing headwinds due to a complex macroeconomic environment, factory shutdowns, growing competitive risks in China, and vehicle price reductions which are pressuring gross margins. During the first quarter of 2024, production was also negatively impacted by the Red Sea maritime supply- chain interferences, sabotage in a Tesla factory\u2019s power supply in Berlin, and a factory closure for the launch of the refreshed Model 3. We remain shareholders. Tesla commenced delivery of its highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup, which features new technologies within the car and its manufacturing lines. Tesla also launched version 12 of its Full Self Driving product, which shows significant progress from prior versions and increases the probability that Tesla\u2019s data collection at scale, and verticalized software and hardware approach will position Tesla as a leader in the future for autonomous driving and shared mobility. We also expect energy storage sales to continue to grow over the coming years as the adoption of renewable energy continues. Lastly, we believe Tesla\u2019s core automotive segment will recover with the company remaining a leader in the EV market, which continues to expand with EVs still accounting for only around 10% of vehicle sales globally.\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold.

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is expected to report another quarter of weaker sales, and it\u2019s running out of alibis.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely \u2018Upflation\u2019 Is the Latest Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers BlackRock Buys Preqin for $3.2 Billion in Private Data Push BlackRock Deal to Make Preqin\u2019s Founder Richer Than Larry Fink\n\nAnalysts surveyed by Bloomberg are estimating the carmaker will report on Tuesday that it handed over 439,302 electric vehicles in the second quarter, a 5.8% drop from a year ago. This would be a second consecutive quarterly decline, which Tesla last posted when it was phasing out its first model, the Roadster, in 2012.\n\nTesla has turned the page on several of the issues that contributed to its struggles early this year, including a suspected arson attack at its factory near Berlin and shipping diversions related to conflict in the Red Sea. That leaves the company with few excuses for its sales slowdown aside from a relatively straightforward problem: Tesla\u2019s older lineup of vehicles is having a harder time keeping up with fresher offerings from rival EV manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tougher to grow when you have increased competition and the current model lineup is a little stale,\u201d said Tom Narayan, a global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Tesla\u2019s stock.\n\nChief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried all sorts of moves to stoke demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles, including slashing prices and offering cut-rate leasing deals. But the discounting didn\u2019t stop the company\u2019s sales from decelerating in the second half of last year, before giving way to decline as the broader EV market cools.\n\nMusk also announced deep staffing cuts in April, which affected more than 10% of Tesla\u2019s workers, including sales staff. While that may have helped the company conserve cash, it also may have factored in its second-quarter delivery numbers.\n\nCustomers who are new to EVs typically have lots of questions about battery range, charging stations and software-based features. Musk is nevertheless increasingly betting on a mostly online sales process and encouraging consumers to order Teslas without even visiting a showroom.\n\nTesla is having a hard time building on the success of the Model Y, which was the best-selling vehicle in the world last year. The sport utility vehicle has been on the market since 2020, while the Model 3 sedan debuted three years earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s first pickup, the Blade Runner-inspired Cybertruck, has gotten off to a slow start since production began late last year. Tesla has recalled the truck several times, including over issues related to its accelerator pedal and windshield wiper.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have shrugged off several analysts lowering their estimates for Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries in recent weeks. While the stock is still down more than 15% so far the year, Musk has buoyed the shares by promising new models as soon as late 2024. He\u2019s also talked up prospects for the company\u2019s humanoid robots and plans to unveil a dedicated robotaxi in August.\n\nMusk received a major vote of confidence last month, when shareholders voted in favor of re-approving his $56 billion compensation package.\n\n\u201cWe see a growing number of investors shifting their outlook to the Robotaxi event on Aug. 8,\u201d Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on Tesla\u2019s stock, wrote in a report last week. \u201cWe see Q2 deliveries as being particularly important for full-year numbers and whether 2024 will be a growth year, however, we expect focus to remain skewed toward the long term until the Robotaxi unveiling.\u201d\n\nKallo expects Tesla to deliver 435,200 units this quarter and about 1.83 million for the year, up only slightly from its 2023 total. While the company vowed in April to introduce fresh models by early next year, it didn\u2019t provide any details on the cars and reiterated that growth will be \u201cnotably lower\u201d in 2024.\n\n(Updates with latest analyst estimate in second paragraph, shares.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Budget-Friendly Stocks Getting Ready to Rocket in 2024",
        "content": "Budget-friendly stocks are increasingly hard to find as top-performing mega-caps edge ever closer to overvaluation. And, as we\u2019ve seen with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past week, even moderate underperformance can be devastating when so much of the wider market hinges on their performance.\n\nBut a handful of budget-friendly stocks are floating in the ether, even if we must reevaluate how we define those budget-friendly stocks. In some cases, they\u2019re purely undervalued \u2014 even if per-share pricing seems high. In other cases, they\u2019re cheap enough to fall within penny stock territory without all the baggage associated with penny stocks. Of course, the sweet spot for budget-friendly stocks is right in the middle: priced low enough that buying a handful of shares won\u2019t break the bank while also offering some material undervaluation, whether based on current fundamentals or projected future performance.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY)\n\nSource: Nintendo\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) is perennially on my list of budget-friendly stocks for a handful of reasons. Primarily, the Japanese company does business better \u2014 in my mind \u2014 than most public American companies. Specifically, while most U.S.-based public companies fight quarter-to-quarter, Nintendo always keeps the long game in mind rather than squeezing every cent of profit from customers on a short-term basis that ultimately proves devastating long-term. Perhaps that\u2019s why Nintendo has been around since 1889 and continues thriving!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor proof of the company\u2019s commitment to long-term excellence, look at its balance sheet \u2014 Nintendo consistently keeps ton of cash on hand with zero debt, providing it a sizable war chest to weather economic uncertainty and take advantage of new opportunities. In fact, a massive cash balance is one of the reasons Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) execs saw Nintendo as ripe for acquisition in 2020. While the buyout didn\u2019t pan out, Microsoft clearly saw Nintendo as one of the best budget-friendly stocks in the market. Little has changed since then, inroads into greater intellectual property utilization that could be yet another cash cow for the budget-friendly gaming stock.\n\nPSQ Holdings (PSQH) The fa\u00e7ade of the New York Stock Exchange is decorated for the listing of PublicSq (PSQH) via a SPAC with Colombier Acquisition Corp.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the much more speculative side of the equation, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) trades in penny stock territory at around $3.75 per share and a market cap of just $110 million. But the former SPAC\u2019s small size shouldn\u2019t dissuade you \u2014 PSQ Holdings is at the forefront of emerging eCommerce trends, which I think will be huge over the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nPSQ Holdings\u2019 primary property is the digital PublicSquare marketplace, which affirms a commitment to \u201chelp consumers \u2018shop their values\u2019 and put purpose behind their purchases.\u201d For now, don\u2019t let the company\u2019s conservative leanings factor into the equation, no matter which side of the political spectrum you fall on. Instead, look to what PSQ\u2019s ethos represents and how that could transform eCommerce.\n\nSocial media\u2019s increased atomization of our online experience means we\u2019re often trapped in a similarly-minded networked ecosystem \u2014 if you want to be charitable \u2014 and an echo chamber if not. It only makes sense that many would prefer to shop the same way: by picking an eCommerce market that aligns with their values, no matter what they are, and that they can feel good supporting. Factor in the fact that Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) offerings are of increasingly poor overseas quality, and many find PublicSquare\u2019s emphasis on American-made goods even more appealing.\n\nUltimately, I think PSQ Holdings stands out among budget-friendly stocks for what it represents as much as its cheap per-share pricing. Considering it\u2019s a relative newcomer to stock exchanges, I see lots of upside in the company\u2019s future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike PSQ Holdings, I see Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of our budget-friendly stocks because of its long-term potential rather than its current pricing or valuation. First, of course, is the \u201ckey man\u201d issue negation as Musk\u2019s pay package panned out. This, of course, cements his focus on Tesla and, no matter how you feel about the man, means that Tesla will benefit from increased personal emphasis on its performance.\n\nThat\u2019s already evident just weeks after the decision as we\u2019re seeing Musk shift his AI emphasis back toward Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory is building a massive GPU warehouse to position more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs in a bid to realign AI development under the Tesla umbrella. This comes on the heels of Tesla\u2019s announced $3 \u2013 $4 billion AI hardware expenditure, showing that Musk and Tesla are serious about asserting their position as AI leaders. Improved AI will go a long way toward addressing Tesla\u2019s \u201cMarch of 9s,\u201d which, in turn, is effectively the last remaining hurdle toward full self-driving car capability.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage.

The platform\u2019s ability to attract viewers interested in both the debate and their favorite pundits\u2019 opinions sets it apart from alternatives like YouTube. Likewise, its unique user base and content moderation outlook make Rumble a standout among budget-friendly stocks for similar reasons to PSQ Holdings: it captures increased atomization of the Internet. It capitalizes on the trend of scaling the \u201c1,000 True Fans\u201d marketing theory that\u2019s increasingly taking hold among forward-looking companies.\n\nWhile Rumble is not yet a major competitor to YouTube, its growth trajectory is promising. Despite a slight dip in first-quarter monthly active users compared to 2023 highs, Rumble maintains a steady global MAU count above 50 million.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Rumble posted a $0.14 loss per share per share, outperforming analyst expectations of a $0.22. Additionally, Rumble has boldly filed an antitrust lawsuit againstGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The lawsuit accuses Google of unfair online advertising practices that favor YouTube over competitors like Rumble. Although the lawsuit\u2019s uncertain outcome makes it a risky move, it also positions Rumble as a formidable underdog among budget-friendly stocks.\n\nStem (STEM) Illustration of robot hand reaching for the letters \"AI\" with tech symbols around it.

AI Stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Allies Interactive\n\nStem (NYSE:STEM) trades roughly within penny stock territory with per-share pricing at $1.10 and a $171 million market cap. But the company\u2019s unique emphasis on both AI and sustainable energy supports a long-term growth trajectory, positioning it among today\u2019s budget-friendly stocks.\n\nStem\u2019s Athena software optimizes the interaction between generators, grid power, renewable energy sources like solar farms, and battery storage. Using an AI framework, Athena autonomously adjusts energy distribution based on weather conditions and energy pricing, making it invaluable for large-scale enterprise clients managing sustainable energy resources.\n\nDespite its penny stock status, Stem has ambitious growth plans. The company\u2019s strategic vision, detailed in its AI & the Future of Energywhite paper, explains how AI integration will drive efficiency and advancement across the sustainable energy market.\n\nWhile Stem faces challenges typical of speculative renewable energy stocks, such as profitability issues and cyclical sales, it has moved beyond its startup phase with a growing portfolio of successful projects. Investing in Stem offers a long-term opportunity among budget-friendly stocks in the sustainable energy sector, capitalizing on the increasing role of AI in green technologies and infrastructure.\n\nFresh Del Monte Produce\u00a0(FDP) Empty grocery cart in a grocery store aisle. Consumer goods.\n\nSource: gyn9037 / Shutterstock\n\nFresh Del Monte Produce (NYSE:FDP) is a unique budget-friendly stock that\u2019s firmly within the defensive side of stock selection and provides a value-based anchor to a budget-friendly portfolio. Although sales dipped slightly in the latest quarterly report, the seasonal nature of fresh fruit and produce suggests a likely rebound in summer, making the stock an attractive buy at its current price.\n\nFresh Del Monte is strategically optimizing its operations to navigate economic and consumer pressures better. Financially, the company reduced total debt by 15%, saving costs in today\u2019s high-interest-rate environment. Additionally, a renewed focus on fresh and value-added sales resulted in a 5% revenue increase in this segment, with avocado sales soaring by 23% despite overall lower sales. This strategic pivot has proven successful, and management is expected to continue pursuing this direction.\n\nFresh Del Monte offers a solid 5.25% dividend yield, allowing investors to build a budget-friendly position through dollar-cost averaging and capitalize on the company\u2019s growing potential.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock\u00a0(GLDD)\n\nSource: Istvan Balogh / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (NASDAQ:GLDD) is overlooked compared to many budget-friendly stocks but uniquely operates within a small niche sector that goes mostly overlooked itself \u2014 waterway management, a key piece of the global supply chain puzzle. The company specializes in deepening, dredging, and expanding waterways along coasts and ports, which makes it relatively recession-proof, and its efforts in coastal beach reclamation align with climate change management initiatives.\n\nRecent financial performance underscores the company\u2019s resilience in a sector that faced prolonged challenges during the pandemic. Great Lakes reported an EBITDA of $43 million, the highest since late 2021, indicating solid tailwinds ahead.\n\nLooking ahead, Great Lakes is ready to capitalize on a record $8.7 billion budget from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, fostering a strong bidding environment for securing steady contract cash flows. With a dredging backlog of $879 million, the company has a clear projection of future income, further stabilizing its financial outlook as supply chains normalize.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in evening deals on Monday, with focus turning squarely to an upcoming address by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for more cues on interest rates.\n\nAnticipation of key payrolls data and the minutes of the Fed\u2019s June meeting also kept sentiment frail, while trading volumes remained slim before the July 4 holiday.\n\nStill, Wall Street marked a positive close on Monday, buoyed chiefly by technology stocks.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,527.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 20,016.00 points by 19:49 ET (23:49 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,471.0 points.\n\nPowell, payrolls and Fed minutes in focus\n\nPowell is set to speak at a European Central Bank conference on Tuesday, where the Fed Chair could potentially address recent data showing some cooling in the U.S. economy and inflation.\n\nThe minutes of the Fed\u2019s meeting are due on Wednesday, and come after the central bank forecast during the meeting that it will cut interest rates only once in 2024. Several Fed officials have also warned that sticky inflation will delay any plans to loosen policy.\n\nNonfarm payrolls data is due on Friday and is expected to provide more cues on the labor market. The sector has been running hot despite sticky inflation and high interest rates, and is also a key consideration for the Fed in cutting interest rates.\n\nBut despite hawkish signals from the Fed, traders were seen increasing their bets that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points in September. The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in a 59% chance of such a possibility.\n\nWall St edges higher, tech reigns\n\nIncreased expectations of rate cuts kept investors positive on stock markets, helping Wall Street rise past signs of a cooling U.S. economy.\n\nTechnology stocks remained the biggest boost to indexes, amid persistent bets that artificial intelligence will help drive up demand for the sector.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3% to 5,475.09 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.8% to 17,876.26 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% to 39,169.52 points.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 6% before its second quarter deliveries, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ended up 1% after Morgan Stanley upgraded its price target on the AI darling.\n\nAmong aftermarket movers, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARAA) rose 3% after The New York Times reported that billionaire Barry Diller was considering a bid for the firm.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures edge lower with Powell in focus\n\nSalesforce shareholders reject compensation plan for CEO, other top executives\n\nBarry Diller considers bid for Paramount after Skydance deal falls through- NYT\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It will be tough for the stock market to keep up the pace after such an explosive first half. Undoubtedly, stocks could easily continue to rise if demand for artificial intelligence accelerates further. In any case, it\u2019s far smarter to lower expectations by a notch, especially with valuations getting a tad ahead of their skis.\n\nWhile not all stocks are pricier than when the year began, I think certain names stand out as more ripe for profit-taking than others. In this piece, we\u2019ll have a glimpse of three overhyped stocks to sell that may be in for rougher waters in the second half.\n\nWhether they\u2019re more vulnerable to amplified downside in the face of the next market crash or correction remains to be seen. Either way, I find there to be a lack of value in the following names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nAfter running into several road bumps in the first half, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares may be viewed by some as more of a prime buy-the-dip candidate. It is still a Magnificent Seven company, after all, and one that could have room to run if it\u2019s to catch up to its six better-performing rivals.\n\nAt the time of writing, TSLA stock was down just over 20% in the first half. With a much-hyped robotaxi event in store for August, the electric vehicle (EV) maker may have the catalyst it needs to make it magnificent again.\n\nDespite the relatively modest multiple \u2014 54.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) \u2014 Tesla and the other autos could roll further downhill from here as hopes for a delivery recovery fade. Some analysts see Tesla coming up short on deliveries for the second quarter. If Elon Musk and his company fail to stack up to expectations, it\u2019s hard to envision TSLA stock turning higher in the second half.\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) also had a painful start to the year, with LULU stock shedding more than 40% of its value in the first half. The woes may not be over yet as the company attempts to find its footing in a fashion scene that\u2019s seeing denim making a comeback of sorts. Jeans seem to be in, while athleisure and yoga pants are out.\n\nThe latest quarterly earnings report, which saw sales rise 10% and a higher guide, provided some relief for investors, at least initially. With LULU stock now stretching lower to kick off the second half; however, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m all too enthused to chase the name as a value play. Especially not while consumers look away from various upscale apparel brands.\n\nThough shares look historically cheap at 24 times trailing P/E, I find it tough for Lululemon to stay relevant in the face of rising competitive threats. Management seems to be pointing the finger at themselves for the recent underperformance, noting \u201cmissed opportunities.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, I think the worst of Lululemon\u2019s woes are mostly out of its control. The apparel scene, as a whole, is just in such a bad spot right now. And it could stay this way for a while.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of laggards, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) finished off the first half with a catastrophic implosion. Now down close to 25% in the past week and over 54% for the first half, questions linger as to what the free-falling U.S. pharmacy retailer will do as it shutters a sizeable chunk of its stores.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s no easy solution for Walgreens, which also trimmed its guidance for the full year, now calling for earnings per share to be in the $2.80 to 2.95 range, down from $3.20 to 3.35. That\u2019s a steep cut and one that\u2019s adding salt to the wounds of an already distressed firm.\n\nManagement\u2019s commentary did not do much to soothe WBA stockholders\u2019 fears, either. CEO Tim Wentworth stated that the \u201ccurrent pharmacy model is not sustainable.\u201d With big changes ahead and significant earnings headwinds on the horizon, WBA stock seems like too risky a stock to buy no matter how much cheaper it gets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Langan said.\n\nTesla is expected to report 6% lower vehicle deliveries in the April to June period, compared to the year-ago quarter, according to analysts' estimates from LSEG.\n\nThe company said in January it expects \"notably lower\" growth in deliveries this year, and in its latest annual impact report, published in May, dropped its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles a year by 2030.\n\nTesla stock fell 20.4% in the first half of the year, compared to a 14.5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nStill, about two-fifths of the analysts have a \"buy\" or higher rating on Tesla, and another two-fifths have \"hold\", with a median target price of $180.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)",

        "content": "There are multiple signs that robots are already being used on a very wide scale and will soon proliferate throughout society. For example, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently reported that it had begun successfully using two of its humanoid, artificial intelligence-powered autonomous robots in one of its factories. Moreover, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that robots could one day generate more revenue than automobiles. And as of June 2023, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was utilizing 750,000 robots in its warehouses and fulfillment centers, up from 350,000 in 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, robots now carry out many functions in healthcare, including assistance with surgeries, supply delivery, and cleaning. According to one report, the global robotics market generated revenue of $46 billion last year and will grow at a compound annual rate of 15% over the next eight years. As a result, the sector is expected to be worth nearly $170 billion in 2032.\n\nHere are the three best robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon reportedly wanted to buy iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), which specializes in making robotic vacuum cleaners, to access the information the company\u2019s products had gathered about the layout of consumers\u2019 homes. According to iRobot\u2019s founder and former CEO, \u00a0Colin Angle, the company\u2019s operating system \u201ccan identify more objects than any other robot vacuum.\u201d It can purportedly comprehend features of users\u2019 homes better than the firm\u2019s previous operating systems.\n\nAmid opposition to the deal from regulators, Amazon eventually backed out of the transaction. The e-commerce giant likely wanted to buy iRobot to tailor its products and marketing efforts more precisely to each consumer\u2019s home. On its own, iRobot can use its operating system to enhance the performance of other robotic devices that it can sell in the future.\n\n\u201cOther iRobot OS devices could have access to (the data), and through this shared understanding of the home, know how they\u2019re supposed to operate,\u201d Angle, who is no longer with the company, explained in 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, iRobot now has a tiny price-to-sales ratio of just 0.3x, and in May, it appointed a promising new CEO, Gary Cohen. In his previous role as CEO of Qualitor Automotive, Cohen increased \u201csales and profits by approximately 100% through the design of proprietary wiper technologies, improved supply chain and operations, and the (launch of ) an omnichannel strategy,\u201d iRobot reported.\n\niRobot\u2019s huge potential and tiny valuation make it one of the best robotics stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo.

These days, its robots are primarily used in warehouses. Among its impressive customers are Walmart (NYSE:WMT), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nOn May 8, after Symbotic\u2019s strong fiscal second-quarter financial report, Deutsche Bank hiked its price target on the shares to $58, well above the shares\u2019 current level of just over $35. The bank, which kept a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the shares, notes that the company\u2019s robots help its customers utilize less storage space while reducing the amount of money they spend on warehouses. Deutsche Bank believes the firm\u2019s products can meaningfully change the logistics sector.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the company generated free cash flow of $18 million last quarter, while its EBITDA margin, excluding certain items, was 5.3%, up from 3.5% during the previous quarter.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) An image of a white, grey, and orange sign with the \"Intuitive Surgical\" logo and number \"1020\" on a patch of grass in front of a white, grey, and orange building on a sunny day.\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leading developer of robotic-assistance devices for surgeons, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) reported that the number of surgical procedures in which its products were used jumped 16% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Moreover, the firm now expects the metric to climb 14% to 17% for the entire year.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that, since the end of the coronavirus pandemic, Intuitive\u2019s operating income, excluding certain items, advanced at an impressive compound annual growth rate of about 16%.\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the new version of the company\u2019s flagship robotic assistance system was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and features many improvements over the previous iteration.\n\nFinally, Bank of America recently identified Intuitive as one of 26 \u201cbest of breed \u201cstocks.\n\nIntuitive\u2019s market-leading position and strong growth make it one of the best robotic stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "title": "Why Tesla Stock Popped Ahead of Second-Quarter Deliveries",
        "content": "Shares of Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have been on the comeback trail recently, and that continued on the first trading day of July. Shares of the leading electric vehicle (EV) maker were higher by 5.5% as of 11:10 a.m. ET Monday morning. The stock is now up by about 18% over the past month.\n\nToday's jump comes just a day before Tesla is expected to report its second-quarter EV delivery data. While estimates have been trending lower, delivery reports from Chinese EV makers today have investors feeling more optimistic about what the American company will say.\n\nThe important Chinese EV market\n\nThe Chinese EV market has been crucial for Tesla, whose most productive factory is in Shanghai. Today, several Chinese EV makers reported strong June and second-quarter deliveries. That might bode well for what Tesla has to share tomorrow.\n\nNio, Li Auto, XPeng, and the larger BYD all showed year-over-year growth in battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales for the quarter. The period seemed to end on a strong note, as Nio delivered a monthly record 21,209 vehicles in June. That was nearly twice what it shipped in June 2023.\n\nMany EV observers have been closely watching the larger BYD, whose BEV volume is more in line with that of Tesla. BYD sold more than 426,000 fully electric vehicles in the second quarter, up about 21% year over year.\n\nTesla analysts have been lowering estimates for its second-quarter sales, with most recent projections averaging about 420,000 EVs. That would be down from about 466,000 delivered in the prior-year period. It would also be the second quarterly period where BYD outsold Tesla to be the world's largest EV seller.\n\nWith China's EV market seemingly recovering, it could result in Tesla beating estimates. Even after that data is released, though, shareholders will want to continue to pay attention to what Tesla says about profit margin when it releases its full second-quarter financial report. If the sales in China are coming from reduced prices, the boost in it shares might be short-lived.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Tesla is running out of excuses for its prolonged sales slump",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is expected to report another quarter of weaker sales, and it\u2019s running out of alibis.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Buys Preqin for $3.2 Billion in Private Data Push France\u2019s Market Rally Falters as Investors See Enduring Risk Justice Department to Charge Boeing, Seeks Guilty Plea from Planemaker Le Pen\u2019s Far Right Wins First Round, Chases French Majority Trump as President or Private Citizen: Why Supreme Court\u2019s Immunity Ruling Is a Test\n\nAnalysts are estimating the carmaker will report on Tuesday that it handed over 441,019 electric vehicles in the second quarter, a 5.4% drop from a year ago. This would be a second consecutive quarterly decline, which Tesla last posted when it was phasing out its first model, the Roadster, in 2012.\n\nTesla has turned the page on several of the issues that contributed to its struggles early this year, including a suspected arson attack at its factory near Berlin and shipping diversions related to conflict in the Red Sea. That leaves the company with few excuses for its sales slowdown aside from a relatively straightforward problem: Tesla\u2019s older lineup of vehicles is having a harder time keeping up with fresher offerings from rival EV manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tougher to grow when you have increased competition and the current model lineup is a little stale,\u201d said Tom Narayan, a global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Tesla\u2019s stock.\n\nChief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried all sorts of moves to stoke demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles, including slashing prices and offering cut-rate leasing deals. But the discounting didn\u2019t stop the company\u2019s sales from decelerating in the second half of last year, before giving way to decline as the broader EV market cools.\n\nMusk also announced deep staffing cuts in April, which affected more than 10% of Tesla\u2019s workers, including sales staff. While that may have helped the company conserve cash, it also may have factored in its second-quarter delivery numbers.\n\nCustomers who are new to EVs typically have lots of questions about battery range, charging stations and software-based features. Musk is nevertheless increasingly betting on a mostly online sales process and encouraging consumers to order Teslas without even visiting a showroom.\n\nTesla is having a hard time building on the success of the Model Y, which was the best-selling vehicle in the world last year. The sport utility vehicle has been on the market since 2020, while the Model 3 sedan debuted three years earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s first pickup, the Blade Runner-inspired Cybertruck, has gotten off to a slow start since production began late last year. Tesla has recalled the truck several times, including over issues related to its accelerator pedal and windshield wiper.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have shrugged off several analysts lowering their estimates for Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries in recent weeks. While the stock is still down 20% for the year, Musk has buoyed the shares by promising new models as soon as late this year. He\u2019s also talked up prospects for the company\u2019s humanoid robots and plans to unveil a dedicated robotaxi in August.\n\nMusk received a major vote of confidence last month, when shareholders voted in favor of re-approving his $56 billion compensation package.\n\n\u201cWe see a growing number of investors shifting their outlook to the Robotaxi event on Aug. 8,\u201d Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst with the equivalent of a buy rating on Tesla\u2019s stock, wrote in a report last week. \u201cWe see Q2 deliveries as being particularly important for full-year numbers and whether 2024 will be a growth year, however, we expect focus to remain skewed toward the long term until the Robotaxi unveiling.\u201d\n\nKallo expects Tesla to deliver 435,200 units this quarter and about 1.83 million for the year, up only slightly from its 2023 total. While the company vowed in April to introduce fresh models by early next year, it didn\u2019t provide any details on the cars and reiterated that growth will be \u201cnotably lower\u201d in 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Known for her appetite for relatively risky tech-based stocks, Cathie Wood has become an icon on Wall Street. The founder of ARK Investment Management, Wood has accumulated a net worth of $220 million and built a reputation owing to her knack for identifying high-potential innovation-focused stocks.\n\nWood was recognized as Wall Street\u2019s best stock picker of 2020 after masterminding the market\u2019s post-pandemic recovery, and her bravery in picking undervalued stocks with plenty of room for growth has seen the ARK CEO become a key influencer for retail investors with a high-risk appetite.\n\nAs for ARK, the investment management firm has amassed $6.71 billion in assets under management (AUM) and will be readying for a market rally in the second half of 2024 and 2025 as the prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts becomes a reality.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith Cathie Wood remaining a long-time supporter of cryptocurrency, the expectation of a market rally in the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s halving event in April 2024 is likely also to shape ARK\u2019s performance for the months ahead. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at three of Wood\u2019s biggest Wall Street bets among her top stock picks.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to stocks with high growth potential on Wall Street, cryptocurrency firms stand among the best market prospects. At the pinnacle of crypto stock market listings is Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), a cryptocurrency exchange that has moved closely alongside Bitcoin in terms of price movements.\n\nIn February, Cathie Wood claimed that Coinbase was \u201cexecuting brilliantly,\u201d while highlighting that the exchange remains the most compliant option throughout the crypto industry.\n\nWhile recent surges in the value of Bitcoin have seen ARK sell off some of its COIN holdings, the stock remains one of the biggest in the investment firm\u2019s portfolio with a 7.8% share.\n\nBecause Coinbase moves alongside the price rallies of Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency bull markets, there is much hope for the stock over the coming months due to Bitcoin\u2019s recent halving event, which has historically paved the way for sustained bull runs and fresh all-time high values for the crypto asset.\n\nIt\u2019s widely hoped that a future cryptocurrency bull run will directly influence the growth of COIN in late 2024 and 2025.\n\nAside from its crypto connotations, Coinbase is a highly innovative platform that has recently introduced its own smart wallet technology to help cryptocurrency holders navigate the complex and sprawling world of blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock. stocks that could be the next Tesla\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nAhead of Coinbase is another innovation-focused stock in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which accounts for 8.1% of ARK\u2019s total AUM.\n\nAlthough ARK has been selling Coinbase stock in recent months due to the relatively strong performance of the cryptocurrency market, Cathie Wood has remained laser-focused on the long-term prospects of Tesla and recently predicted that the stock will grow an astonishing 1,350% in the five years leading up to 2029.\n\nTesla has been struggling on Wall Street of late, owing to the tumultuous leadership of Elon Musk, and has recorded a 20% decline over the first two quarters of 2024. However, Wood\u2019s belief in the potential of TSLA indicates that its recent decline could offer a strong buying opportunity for investors with sufficient risk appetite.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) hood stock: An image of a wallet with a coin in it, a cellphone on top depicting Robinhood logo. Robinhood crypto\n\nSource: salarko/Shutterstock\n\nAnother cryptocurrency-focused stock that Cathie Wood has remained a long-term supporter of is Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD).\n\nAlthough the retail investor exchange platform only represents 4.7% of ARK Invest\u2019s AUM at the time of writing, HOOD has undergone significant growth of 78% in the first half of 2024 and has more than doubled in value since the beginning of Q3 2023.\n\nThis illustrates the strength of the stock\u2019s ability to bounce back from its lows following a series of bad press in the wake of the meme stock frenzy, which saw retail investors become frustrated by Robinhood suspending trading on stocks like GameStop.\n\nWall Street analysts have supported Wood\u2019s assertion that Robinhood is ripe for growth, and Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak recently upgraded the stock from Peer Perform to Outperform.\n\nMuch like Coinbase, Robinhood\u2019s exposure to the cryptocurrency landscape means that the stock could be in line for a period of strong performance should Bitcoin undergo its post-halving rally, as some analysts anticipate, over the course of the next 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Akash Sriram and Hyunjoo Jin\n\n(Reuters) - Tesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 3.7%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.\n\nThe company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday.\n\nTesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be \"notably lower\" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdding to these problems is a consumer shift to cheaper gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, which has left Tesla with a growing inventory of vehicles that it is trying to move with price cuts and incentives including cheaper financing options and leases.\n\nEarlier this year, CEO Elon Musk shelved plans to make an all-new, cheaper electric car and shifted Tesla's focus to robotaxis, a concern for some investors who fear that autonomous technology will be hard to perfect. Still, investors overwhelmingly voted in favor of his record $56 billion pay package at the annual shareholder meeting last month.\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy predicted an 11% drop in second-quarter deliveries, Tesla's biggest ever. He said \"a soft delivery result could turn attention back to the currently challenging fundamental environment for Tesla\".\n\nTesla's stock has lost a quarter of its value this year, making it one of the worst performers on the S&P 500, despite Musk's forecast in April that Tesla would be able to increase sales this year. He has slashed costs including through mass layoffs that gutted Tesla's supercharging team.\n\nStory continues\n\nOLD DESIGNS\n\nSome analysts expect the company to post its first annual sales drop this year. In the January-March period, deliveries had dropped by the most in nearly four years and missed Wall Street expectations.\n\nTesla sales have been especially weak in Europe, sales fell 36% in May, due to waning EV subsidies and poor demand from fleet operators, who accounted for nearly half its sales in the region last year.\n\nReuters reported in May that Tesla was working to appease some European leasing firms after its repeated retail price cuts tanked their fleet's value and its slow service and expensive repairs alienated their corporate customers.\n\nAs rivals in China have rolled out cheaper models, Tesla has been slow to bring new designs to market. In April, Musk said Tesla would introduce \"new models\" later this year, including affordable vehicles, but offered no details about pricing.\n\nTesla refreshed its Model 3 sedan late last year, but without a major revamp in design. Its best-selling Model Y SUV, its Model S premium sedan, and the Model X SUV have not seen major changes in years.\n\nThe company started deliveries of its Cybertrucks late last year, but Musk does not expect to mass produce the vehicle until 2025. The pickup has been plagued by recalls and quality issues.\n\nIn May, Tesla left out its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 in its latest impact report, a big change after touting for years a long-term annual growth target of 50% for EV deliveries.\n\nTesla expects to unveil robotaxis on Aug. 8, as it seeks to boost adoption of its \"Full Self-Driving\" software. But it is not clear when production will begin or how many of them will be made.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)",

In April, Musk said Tesla would introduce \"new models\" later this year, including affordable vehicles, but offered no details about pricing.\n\nTesla refreshed its Model 3 sedan late last year, but without a major revamp in design. Its best-selling Model Y SUV, its Model S premium sedan, and the Model X SUV have not seen major changes in years.\n\nThe company started deliveries of its Cybertrucks late last year, but Musk does not expect to mass produce the vehicle until 2025. The pickup has been plagued by recalls and quality issues.\n\nIn May, Tesla left out its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 in its latest impact report, a big change after touting for years a long-term annual growth target of 50% for EV deliveries.\n\nTesla expects to unveil robotaxis on Aug. 8, as it seeks to boost adoption of its \"Full Self-Driving\" software. But it is not clear when production will begin or how many of them will be made.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Tesla Stock?",
        "content": "Since hitting a peak in 2021, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has struggled to build much, if any, momentum. Once trading at more than $400 per share, the stock has been beaten up for the last three years and currently sits at around $185.\n\nWhile those who invested before 2021 are likely sitting on comfortable gains, those who've invested more recently may not be so fortunate. Perhaps Tesla's best days have already passed, begging the question: Is it too late to invest in Tesla? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nExplaining Tesla's fall\n\nTesla's stock dip can largely be attributed to dwindling gross-profit margins. At its peak, Tesla's margins were above 30%, easily the best in the entire auto industry. Today, those margins have receded to 17% which, although still near the top, now face a number of pressures.\n\nThe reason for this decline is varied but can be boiled down to a reduction in consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs). Higher interest rates have dissuaded would-be buyers due to the increased costs of financing a vehicle. In an attempt to stimulate demand, Tesla decided to cut prices in 2023. This, combined with higher costs across supply chains and labor markets, caused margins to tumble. TSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHowever, interest rates will fall eventually, and demand for EVs are likely to rebound as these factors are typically cyclical. Current trends suggest that rates may start to finally decrease by year's end. Naturally, as borrowing becomes cheaper, consumer demand for EVs should rebound.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla stands to benefit from the overall trend in EV adoption around the world. Governments are implementing stricter emissions regulations and offering incentives to encourage EV purchases, creating a supportive environment for Tesla's long-term growth.\n\nPlus, the company is expanding internationally with construction of a factory in Mexico underway and plans to enter India and Thailand in the coming years.\n\nA new Tesla takes shape\n\nTesla is striving to become more than just an EV company. One of its key efforts right now is building out autonomous vehicles and eventually launching a robotaxi business. Tesla's self-driving technology has made significant strides, and the company is preparing for a worldwide demo of its robotaxi on Aug. 8.\n\nIn addition to autonomous vehicles, Tesla is also in the midst of getting its humanoid robot, Optimus, ready for market launch, which is anticipated to happen in 2025. While these endeavors are not yet ready for widespread commercial release, Tesla has made notable progress. Optimus is already being used in Tesla factories, showcasing its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labor costs across all kinds of industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking the optimistic route\n\nCritics will point out that Tesla and deadlines don't always mix well. But it is difficult to contend with its ability to eventually follow through. If Tesla can replicate similar levels of success in its robotaxis and Optimus as it has with its EVs, it could transform the company and maybe even society for the better.\n\nWhile it is difficult to measure the true monetary impact that these two innovations will have simply because no such market exists for these types of products, some estimates put the total revenue of robotaxis at $700 billion a year and Optimus at around $1 trillion. Combined, and if accurate, that means the two would more than triple Tesla's current revenue.\n\nAt the risk of being optimistic, I believe Tesla's best days remain ahead and that it isn't too late to invest in one of the most transformative companies of the future. Tesla's ability to innovate and push the boundaries of technology has been a key driver of its success thus far. If it can continue to lead in the EV market while successfully expanding into new areas like autonomous vehicles and robotics, the company could soar to even greater heights.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Halfway Into 2024: 2 Underperforming \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" represent some of the strongest businesses around. However, a few members of this elite group have failed to live up to expectations in the first half of 2024.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the widely followed S&P 500 index has climbed 14.8% through June 26, but weak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which are up 11.6%. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has been the worst performer, with a recent dip in sales from its electric cars sending the stock down 21%.\n\nSometimes, betting on strong companies when they are experiencing temporary weakness can pay off over the long run. Indeed, both companies have promising growth opportunities unfolding in artificial intelligence (AI), which could have a huge impact on shareholder returns over the next decade.\n\nHere's why these stocks are ready to take off.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWeak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple stock year to date, but since the company's last earnings report in early May, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500, with the shares up 21%. The stock got a significant bounce following the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where Apple unveiled highly anticipated artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features coming to iOS 18 later this year.\n\nApple Intelligence will be the biggest update to Apple's operating system in years. The AI features in this update will allow users to summarize long texts, create images, and receive personalized search assistance from Siri, just to name a few highlights.\n\nOf course, Apple has a profitable business angle here. While iOS 18 will be free to download like previous updates, the AI features will require devices with more recent processors, such as the A17 Pro chip found on the iPhone. iOS 18 will be a huge incentive for users with older devices to upgrade, and that could lead to record iPhone revenue during the holiday quarter.\n\nBeyond iOS 18, iPhone 16 is also expected to come in a new larger size of 6.9 inches for the Pro Max version, which could be enough to drive strong demand on its own. It's all setting up for a stretch of improving revenue growth over the next year.\n\nWall Street analysts are increasingly bullish. The current consensus is that Apple's sales will grow just 3% in fiscal 2025, but Evercore ISI recently raised its growth forecast from 4% to 7% and even sees a scenario where Apple could report double-digit top-line growth next year.\n\nMore analysts may raise their growth estimates as the launch of iOS 18 draws closer, which could send the stock even higher in the second half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the push into AI software could also benefit Apple's higher-margin services business (e.g., app sales) and drive above-average earnings growth. For these reasons, Apple is likely heading into a stretch of accelerating growth that could launch the stock higher over the next few years.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla shares have been slashed in half from their all-time high. A few reasons are to blame, including weak car demand amid rising interest rates and the uncertainty around the recent shareholder vote to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's 2018 performance award.\n\nWith shareholders recently voting to reinstate Musk's $56 billion pay package, it removes a major cloud over the stock since some investors were concerned that Musk might eventually leave Tesla if the vote didn't pass. However, the stock has moved higher since the vote as investors turn their attention back to Tesla's growth opportunities.\n\nTesla plans to unveil Cybercab in August, which opens up a massive market for the company. Analysts expect most of Tesla's revenue to come from the robotaxi market over the long term, which is significant, given that the company's $626 billion market cap is mostly based on its revenue from electric cars that generate more than 80% of the company's revenue right now. However, RBC Capital sees 52% of Tesla's valuation will ultimately be driven by robotaxis, 27% by full-self-driving car software, 15% by Megapack batteries, and only 6% by electric cars.\n\nMusk compared Tesla's robotaxi business strategy to those of services like Airbnb and Uber. Tesla will operate some of the robotaxi fleet itself, while a certain number of customers can choose to contribute their own cars to the service. Tesla aims to one day have tens of millions of cars in its fleet worldwide. It would lead to a new high-margin revenue stream in service fees flowing back to Tesla.\n\nThe robotaxi opportunity reflects Tesla's growing capabilities in AI. It has about 35,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) currently used for AI training, but it plans to have more than twice that number by the end of 2024. These are not cheap, with each H100 selling for thousands of dollars. Tesla's capital expenditures have quadrupled over the last four years to $9 billion and will continue to grow.\n\nIf Tesla is successful in expanding its robotaxi service over the next decade, it could have a huge impact on the company's profitability and, therefore, lead to a higher valuation for Tesla stock.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving rating changes.\n\nAffirm Holdings\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Goldman Sachs launched coverage with a new analyst on Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) at Buy with a $42 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman regards AFRM as a frontrunner in the provision of contemporary credit solutions for consumers, boasting a varied array of products tailored for point-of-sale financing and daily expenditures. The analysts are particularly taken with the sophistication of AFRM\u2019s underwriting processes compared to its fintech counterparts, as well as the company\u2019s consistent delivery of well-managed credit results, even amidst rapid growth that outpaces its peers. This success is attributed to AFRM\u2019s approach to short-duration receivables and transaction-level underwriting, which enables the company to individually assess and underwrite various types of consumer spending. These include everyday purchases (\u201cPay now\u201d via Debit), cash flow management or short-term financing (such as Pay-in-4), and more extended installment financing options (spanning 6-12 months or more), all facilitated through a single card-based product, the Affirm Debit+ card.\n\nIn contrast to traditional card issuers who have historically provided a single revolving credit line to cover these needs, AFRM\u2019s method incurs significantly lower costs for the consumer and reduces credit risk for the lender by avoiding large open-to-buy balances. Goldman believes that AFRM\u2019s precise underwriting grants it a competitive edge, enabling the firm to delve deeper into the credit spectrum and make inroads into the subprime/near-prime market segment\u2014a challenging area for many established players to engage in sustainably. The analysts anticipate that this precision in underwriting will bolster AFRM\u2019s position in the market and facilitate its continued growth and success.\n\nBuy at Goldman means \u201cAnalysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock\u2019s total return potential relative to its coverage universe.\"\n\nHow did the stock react? Affirm Holdings opened the regular session at $31.02 and closed at $33.70, a gain of 12.82% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nPenn Entertainment\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Raymond James downgraded PENN Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:PENN) to Market Perform and removed their $20 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? The recommendation change follows a 21% increase in the company\u2019s share price since May 20, which was influenced by activist pressure and merger and acquisition rumors. Initially, when coverage began, Raymond James posited that the stock\u2019s potential was limited to approximately $20/share. This ceiling was attributed to ongoing discounts related to the interactive segment and the \u201cpenalty box\u201d status, which were expected to continue until a clearer route to profitability in the interactive space was established or a significant strategic shift occurred.\n\nHowever, the path to profitability in the digital realm for PENN remains ambiguous, and no substantial changes in strategy, such as a complete sale of the company, appear imminent. Consequently, Raymond James advises investors to capitalize on the recent gains and seek more favorable risk-adjusted investment opportunities within the sector. The brokerage highlights Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) as its preferred choice, suggesting that it offers a more attractive investment profile compared to PENN under the current market conditions.\n\nRaymond James\u2019 assessment reflects a cautious stance on PENN\u2019s short-term prospects, emphasizing the need for clarity in its digital strategy and profitability outlook.\n\nMarket Perform at Raymond James means \u201cThe security is expected to perform generally in line with the S&P 500 over the next 12 months and could potentially be used as a source of funds for more highly rated securities.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Penn Entertainment opened the regular session at $18.85 and closed at $18.26, a gain of 5.58% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nTesla\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, (well Tuesday after hours) Stifel initiated coverage on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) at Buy with a $265 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Stifel believes that TSLA is very well positioned to deliver robust multi-year growth in 2025-27+. In the near term, the revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y refresh should bolster sales, followed by the commencement of its next-generation vehicle (Model 2) production, which will likely garner very strong demand. The Stifel analysts also believe TSLA\u2019s AI-based Full Self-Driving initiative has the potential to generate significant value through sales of FSD, possible licensing agreements, and as a critical driver of longer-term RoboTaxi initiatives.\n\nNoteworthy near-term risks include delivery levels following lackluster 1Q24 results, as well as near-term EV adoption headwinds and the U.S. election. Stifel is initiating coverage with a Buy and a $265 target price.\n\nBuy at Stifel means \u201cWe expect a total return of greater than 10% over the next 12 months with total return equal to the percentage price change plus dividend yield.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Tesla opened the regular session at $186.69 and closed at $196.37, a gain of 4.81% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nQiagen\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Wolfe Research upgraded Qiagen (NYSE:QGEN) to Outperform with a $50 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Wolfe Research has expressed increased confidence in QGEN\u2019s prospects following the company\u2019s compelling Corporate Management Day (CMD) presentation on June 17th. The brokerage is optimistic about QGEN\u2019s ability to surpass its competitors in the upcoming year, as management has presented a credible strategy to achieve over 7% organic growth and an Operating Margin exceeding 31% between 2024 and 2028.\n\nThe current portfolio is particularly appealing due to its high percentage of recurring revenue, approximately 85%, alongside several medium-term growth catalysts and strong market positions. Additionally, Wolfe Research anticipates that QGEN\u2019s latent-TB segment will remain unchallenged by new competitors in the near term, and they trust in the company\u2019s disciplined execution, as demonstrated by initiatives like NeuMoDx.\n\nDespite these positive indicators, QGEN\u2019s stock is currently trading at less than 20x the next twelve months\u2019 P/E ratio, which is more than a 5x discount compared to its peers. This valuation leads Wolfe Research to believe that the shares are undervalued, presenting an attractive investment opportunity with limited downside risk. In light of this assessment, the brokerage has decided to revise its estimates for 2025 and beyond, reflecting a stronger belief in QGEN\u2019s trajectory towards enhanced growth and profitability.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s analysis suggests that QGEN is well-positioned for future success, and its current stock price offers a favorable entry point for investors.\n\nOutperform at Wolfe means \u201cThe security is projected to outperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Qiagen opened the regular session at $41.02 and closed at $41.10, a gain of 1.02% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) to Neutral with a $181 price target.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet's to Neutral citing several areas of transitional risk that warrant cautionary observation. Key concerns include the potential impact of AI on search functionality, particularly the introduction of AI Overviews, which may temporarily disrupt search ad revenues. Additionally, there are indications of emerging competition from Bing, potentially leading to a loss of search market share. Moreover, the shift of search ad revenue towards retail media networks, influenced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others entering this space, is expected to accelerate, posing further uncertainties.\n\nAnother significant factor is Amazon's aggressive foray into video advertising, including the integration of ads on Prime Video and a robust upfront sales strategy, which could alter the dynamics of ad sales, particularly affecting Alphabet's YouTube platform. The research team also highlights the possibility of heightened capital expenditure (capex) for AI, driven by competitive pressures within the industry.\n\nIn light of these transitional risks, Rosenblatt suggests a cautious stance on Alphabet until clearer outcomes emerge from these developments. Monitoring how Alphabet navigates these challenges will be crucial in reassessing its investment outlook going forward.\n\nNeutral at Rosenblatt means \u201cWe believe that this stock\u2019s performance will be in line with the average return of others in its industry over the following 12 months.\u201c\n\nHow did the stock react? Alphabet opened the regular session at $184.17 and closed at $182.15, a decline of 1.76% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Stifel initiates on Tesla; downgrade for Alphabet\n\nRising trade policy uncertainty poses a downside risk to growth: Goldman Sachs\n\nExclusive-US prosecutors meeting with Boeing, crash victims as criminal charging decision looms, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other tech stocks.\n\nGerstner is Bullish on Tech in 2024\n\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\n\nGerstner Thinks Now is the Right Time to \u00a0Invest in Tech\n\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and\u00a0addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\n\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\n\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28. 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $103,663,363\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the 9th largest holding of Brad Gerstner, accounting for 1.59% of his portfolio. Gerstner increased his position in the stock by 277% from the previous quarter. The company is making strides in autonomous driving. The FSD V12, a fully autonomous vehicle, has driven over 300 billion miles. The FSD chip, developed by TSLA, is an AI inference chip capable of running Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) autonomous vehicle software. The company is also actively working to advance its core AI infrastructure and AI compute, by doubling its training in AI and compute compared to the previous quarter. The Tesla Bot, a general-purpose humanoid robot can perform a variety of mundane and monotonous tasks.\n\nOverall, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was held by 75 hedge funds with total stakes amounting to $4.95 billion. Analysts hold a consensus Buy opinion on TSLA and the Street-high target of $310 implies an upside of 57% from current levels.\u00a0On May 7, Brad Gerstner appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he discussed the future of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and its exemplary position in AI and data. Gerstner likes Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitive advantage in AI and self-driving and believes it's \"underappreciated\". Here are some comments from the interview:\n\n\"Well, first, let me say I think Elon has done an extraordinary job, and I think his advantage in A.I. and full self-driving relative to all the other manufacturers in the world is deeply under appreciated. A ChatGPT moment for self-driving after ten years of marginal improvements, we had a profound breakthrough around imitation learning I think that will be an incredible asset to the company.\"\n\nHe then discussed how companies need to have enough supporting data to compete with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is quite challenging at the moment. Here are some additional comments from the interview:\n\n\"I don't think it's an asset that can be replicated by other OEMs. Unless you have the data, you're going to have a very hard time catching Tesla in full self-driving I don't think BYD will be able to play in that game either.\"\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 9th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. You can visit 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner to see the other tech stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "You\u2019ve Been Warned! 3 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.",
        "content": "We have all heard about the woes of renewable energy stocks these days. Macroeconomic uncertainty has disincentivized consumers and businesses to stop investing in clean energy technologies or infrastructure. Moreover, high interest rates have also severely dented consumer demand for new electric vehicles, which have come with expensive car notes and car insurance. On the earnings side, renewable energy companies tend to be capital expenditure (capex) heavy. With rates as high as they are, higher capex could translate to more pressure on bottom-line margins, keeping investors interested in the space largely at bay.\n\nNonetheless, renewable energy technology is not going anywhere. Despite the current slump, the sector will eventually rebound from its current doldrums. Below are three renewable energy stocks to buy before it\u2019s too late.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) has emerged from being just a maker of lithium-ion batteries to a world-class seller of new energy vehicles (NEVs). The NEV maker was even able to best long-time competitor Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in terms of sales in 2023. Despite concerns about a slump in electric vehicles, BYD has largely sustained its strong growth trajectory. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 31st), BYD sales figures grew 46% year-over-year to 301,631 passenger vehicles, 300,114 of which were NEVs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe intense competition in China\u2019s domestic EV market has put pressure on the margins of BYD and other competitors, but the growth speaks for itself. In April, BYD\u2019s NEV sales soared 48.9% to 313,245 vehicles, while in May, NEV sales also increased 38.1% to 331,817 NEVs. International opportunities, particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, await BYD and will certainly boost the carmaker\u2019s financial figures going forward.\n\nNot to mention, BYD is still at an attractive valuation compared to Tesla, for example. In particular, the Chinese NEV maker\u2019s forward-looking P/E multiple is around 19.9x forward earnings, making it an attractive investment opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolar panel module manufacturer First Solar (NYSE:FSLR) also deserves an honest look from investors. First Solar designs and manufactures photovoltaic (PV) solar cell modules that leverage thin-film semiconductor technology. \u201cThin film\u201d refers to the thin layer of non-crystalline silicon that goes into the semiconductor portion of solar panels. The process takes significantly less silicon, thus bringing overall costs downward.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike many American solar panel manufacturers, First Solar had trouble fending off Chinese competitors making solar panels with similarly advanced technology but at lower manufacturing costs. That is set to change. The Biden Administration announced a 50% tariff on solar module imports from China. This move is certainly welcomed in the U.S. domestic solar energy sector.\n\nFirst Solar\u2019s shares have rallied 34.4% YTD, yet the company trades at 16.2x forward earnings, which is less expensive considering the environment of expensive tech equities in the United States.\n\niShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) An image of a man charging an electric car with icons for renewable energy sources in the background; renewable energy grid\n\nSource: petovarga/Shutterstock\n\nInvestors who desire diversification in the sector and are still afraid to put any significant amount of money into a single renewable energy stock should consider exchange-traded funds or (ETFs). The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN) could make a good investment. The 2-billion-dollar ETF has invested in 145 different equities exposed to varying facets of the broader renewable energy sector. This includes solar energy, hydrogen energy, hydroelectricity and wind energy.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s holdings include First Solar, Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA), a sizable geothermal energy business, and Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), a developer of proton\u2013exchange membrane hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nThe renewable sector has not performed well broadly, which is reflected in ICLN\u2019s year-to-date performance. Since the beginning of the year, ICLN has fallen more than 11%. However, with inflation seemingly under control, renewable energy stocks could very well rebound, making an investment into ICLN while it has already lost lucrative value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "This is the Chart of the Week from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nCar companies often seem like brands that last forever, with names like Ford, Chevrolet, and Mercedes woven into the history books. Even Buick and Lincoln are still around, perhaps thanks in part to Tiger Woods, Matthew McConaughey \u2014 and Michael Connelly.\n\nBut like any business, the history of the auto market is littered with defunct car brands like Studebaker, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Plymouth, Mercury, AMC, DeLorean, Saturn, and Saab.\n\nPeople plan on having cars potentially for a decade (I am on year 15, myself) and count on having the company be available for support, parts, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 critical recalls.\n\nKnowing a car company will be around is a legitimate factor when considering what car to buy.\n\nWhich is why prospective car buyers may be looking at some version of our Chart of the Week.\n\nThe nascent EV market has given us many new names like Tesla, Polestar, Rivian, and Lucid. And with their startup status, new technology, and an extremely capital-intensive business, the possibility of them being around in a decade is even more of an uphill slog \u2014 even with hill-start assist.\n\nThis week, Volkswagen invested $5 billion in a joint venture with Rivian, giving the challenged EV maker a much-needed influx of cash. The stock jumped 67% before settling down around 30% up on Monday\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cVW\u2019s investments in Rivian will prove valuable in helping it achieve the scale necessary to get to positive free cash flow,\u201d BofA analyst John Murphy wrote in a research note this week. \u201cThe company is one of the most viable among the start-up EV automakers with attractive product, solid long-term strategy, and adequate funding well into 2025+.\u201d\n\nViability remains the operative word with these companies. As Murphy's team notes in its risk overview, the ability to raise money and sustain positive earnings and free cash flow are crucial factors.\n\nOur chart lays these concerns bare: Rivian is down 89% since its 2021 IPO as Tesla and Ford are up 1,253% and 22%, respectively, over the last five years. (And down 45% and 37%, respectively, since Rivian's IPO.) Those numbers mean Tesla\u2019s concerns about sticking around are mostly gone, for now.\n\nAnd Ford\u2019s conservatism, knowing its historical role as an automaker and staying focused in that literal lane \u2014 unlike Tesla, with its \u201cwe\u2019re a robotaxi AI company\u201d mindset \u2014 must be reassuring for buyers.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns about whether Rivian and its competitors will make it won\u2019t go away until more hit the road and the company keeps its head above water, proving it has the cash to not just survive but thrive.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance morning brief image\n\nView comments",

        "title": "EVs are giving new owners more headaches, and Tesla is a big reason why: J.D. Power study",
        "content": "Automotive research firm J.D. Power\u2019s highly watched initial quality study is out \u2014 and it appears EVs are giving consumers big headaches.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s study tracks responses from nearly 100,000 purchasers and lessees of 2024 vehicles within the first 90 days of ownership, and for the first time in the study\u2019s 38-year history, it incorporates repair visit data. Overall, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles averaged 180 PP100 (or 180 problems per 100 vehicles), while battery electric vehicles (BEVs) averaged a whopping 266 PP100, 86 points higher than ICE vehicles.\n\nAutomakers have typically said that EVs are generally less problematic and require fewer repairs than ICE vehicles because they have a smaller number of parts and systems. However, J.D. Power's study with newly incorporated repair data shows EVs, as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles in all repair categories.\n\n\u201cOwners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\u201d wrote Frank Hanley, senior director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power, in the study.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that the introduction of new technology has challenged manufacturers to maintain vehicle quality,\u201d Hanley added.\n\nJ.D. Power\u2019s study reported no notable improvements in BEV quality this year, and that has to do with the biggest name in the EV space \u2014 Tesla (TSLA).\n\nTypically the gap between Tesla\u2019s quality and that of legacy automakers\u2019 EVs has been wide, with Tesla\u2019s score better than other automakers. But that disparity has narrowed, with Tesla's score and traditional automakers' average scores for EVs standing at 266 PP100. \u201cThe removal of traditional feature controls, such as turn signals and wiper stalks, has not been well received by Tesla customers,\u201d J.D. Power said, which has led to Tesla\u2019s score worsening in the latest model year (to 266 from 253 in 2023).\n\nInitial quality issues with EVs come as demand for EVs in general in the US has slowed. Obstacles like lack of charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and elevated costs (which are coming down) have hurt EV adoption. Adding quality concerns and high repair costs to the ownership bill will not help the electrification of the nation\u2019s fleet of vehicles, which is among the top priorities for the White House. A Tesla supercharging location is seen on Kipling Street, June 3, 2024 in Houston. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA recent McKinsey consumer pulse survey also found that 46% of Americans who own EVs are considering going back to ICE vehicles, a surprising stat given the overall global percentage was 29%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking across brands in general, J.D. Power\u2019s study said Ram, Stellantis\u2019s truck brand, topped the overall rankings list with a 149 PP100 ranking, with Chevrolet, Hyundai, Kia, and Buick also near the top. Porsche, at 172 PP100, beat out all premium brands, ahead of Lexus and Genesis.\n\nOn the flip side, Polestar, Dodge, Tesla, Rivian, and Volvo (tied with Audi) were the worst in terms of overall quality, with pure EV brands like Polestar, Rivian, and the aforementioned Tesla dragging down EV rankings.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "title": "Tesla's humanoid opportunity is 'bigger' than autonomous cars - Morgan Stanley",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley analysts explored how AI is transforming robotics, and they now see the humanoid opportunity as \"far bigger and faster adopting than autonomous cars.\" Specifically, the analyst looked at Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Optimus humanoid robot.\n\n\"AI is driving transformational change in robotics,\" analysts at the firm proclaimed. \"We believe the humanoids opportunity is far bigger and faster adopting than autonomous cars and will see a greater quantum of capital behind it. Tesla is at the epicenter of the theme. Investors may need to add new tabs to their excel models.\"\n\nCommenting on why the world needs robots shaped like humans, the analysts said the strongest argument is that the world was already created for and by humans. Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang agrees. He recently said, \u201cThe easiest robot to adapt into the world are humanoid robots because we built the world for us.\"\n\nSo, how big is the humanoid opportunity? The analysts said amid a theoretical $30 trillion global labor market, their US TAM model forecasts a humanoid population of 8 million units by 2040 ($357 billion wage impact) and 63 million units by 2050 ($3 trillion wage impact).\n\nAt Tesla's recent annual meeting, CEO Elon Musk said he believes that humanoids will eventually outnumber humans by two-to-one or more. \"I think the ratio of humanoid robots to humans will probably be at least two-to-one, something like that,\" Musk said. \"One-to-one for sure. So, which means like somewhere on the order of 10 billion humanoid robots. Maybe, maybe, maybe 20 billion or 30 billion.\"\n\nThe analysts believes Tesla is uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from humanoids. He highlights three key factors supporting the Tesla \"AI Enabler\" case:\n\nMassive data set that is both high quality (edge cases from unique driving situations) and continuously growing at an accelerating pace (constantly collecting data from increasing miles driven across growing car parc). 2. Massive global manufacturing footprint with labor-intensive processes that are relatively simple to replicate via automation, which creates the opportunity to \"observe\" and collect data from its own workers to train bots (and continuously iterate upon that pattern). 3. Experience in vertically integrating key hardware and software infrastructure.\n\nThe analysts highlight that their current $310 price target on Tesla is derived from the company\u2019s auto (hardware), auto-related (software, services), and energy-related businesses, and they have not included the potential humanoid opportunity into Tesla's revenue streams. The firm maintains an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla's humanoid opportunity is 'bigger' than autonomous cars - Morgan Stanley\n\nBoeing Starliner's return from space to hinge on weeks of more testing\n\nExplainer-What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next after NFL loses $4.7 billion \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSunday Ticket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 trial\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla Investors Brace for Big Share Price Moves as Major Catalysts Loom",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A rare streak of tranquility in Tesla Inc. shares is about to end, as investors brace for three crucial events over the coming six weeks that could bring back the wild swings often associated with the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s stock.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden\u2019s Disastrous Debate Accelerates Doubts Over Candidacy Democrats Question Replacing Biden: Here\u2019s How It Could Work Biden Struggles as He Spars With Trump on Economy: Debate Takeaways Gavin Newsom Is Ready for the Biden Emergency Biden Struggles Against Trump in High-Stakes 2024 Debate\n\nIn less than a week, the Elon Musk-led company will report second-quarter delivery results, followed by earnings later in July, and the unveiling of its self-driving vehicle \u2014 also called robotaxi \u2014 in early August. Options trading data show that investors are positioning for a move of around 15% in either direction through mid-August, according to data compiled by Citigroup Inc.\n\nBut, strategists say the shares could see much more turmoil than that. \u201cTesla options are underestimating volatility across these three upcoming catalysts,\u201d Citi\u2019s equity trading strategist Vishal Vivek said in a note to clients. These events have triggered big stock moves in the past, including for Tesla suppliers and other EV makers, Vivek said.\n\n\u201cConsidering how important Tesla\u2019s deliveries have been in the past, how the much the stock moves on earnings and the potential for a new product line announcement at the robotaxi day, the 15% move implied between now and the Aug. 16 expiry seems low,\u201d he added in an interview.\n\nTesla shares have been trading within a pretty tight range since early May after gyrating earlier in the year. The stock remains below its 200-day moving average \u2014 a longer-term trend indicator that traders pay close attention to \u2014 but a sharp move higher this week signals a potential for change.\n\nThat\u2019s boosting optimism among some investors. \u201cWhile the intermediate-term period of consolidation and downtrend remains intact for Tesla since 2021, the short-term picture has begun to improve markedly in the last two months,\u201d said Mark Newton, global head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 estimates for the company\u2019s second-quarter deliveries have been coming down rapidly, and along with that the expectation for both profit and revenue. Yet, some argue that Tesla\u2019s troubles around selling its vehicles are widely understood, so that barring a heavy miss, the shares can actually rally once the figures come out.\n\nTraders have taken an increasingly bullish stance on where Tesla may find its shares toward the end of the summer. Options traders have bid up the price of calls that eye a 10% rally and expire in two months relative to the cost of equivalent puts. That dynamic signals rising interest to chase the stock higher, coupled with fading desire to hedge a dive down.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe real test for the stock, however, will be the unveiling of the company\u2019s robotaxi in August.\n\nAs Musk tries to re-position Tesla as an artificial-intelligence company, rather than just an EV maker, a lot is depending on the August event. Tesla shares currently command a hefty premium that\u2019s towering over all other mega-cap technology stocks, even that of the market\u2019s favorite AI-play, Nvidia Corp.\n\nThat pricey valuation is underpinned by investors\u2019 faith in Musk\u2019s ability to successfully transform Tesla into a dominant AI player. The robotaxi reveal will be a pivotal step in that direction.\n\nAs such, correctly predicting how the push and pull of these catalysts will play out over the coming weeks is tough. But technical strategists recommend watching some key levels to understand whether the stock is breaking out in one direction or the other.\n\n\u201cOn the upside, a rally above the $206 resistance, which is a convergence of its February peak and the 200-day moving average, would mark a breakout and act as the next incremental positive for the stock\u2019s trend,\u201d said Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co. That would mean a 4.3% jump from Tesla\u2019s Thursday close of $197.42.\n\nOn the other hand, any decline that takes the shares below their shorter-term trend-line of the 50-day moving average will be notable. It would require an 11% drop from the stock\u2019s last close for that to happen.\n\nWhile it is hard to predict what the next few weeks have in store for Tesla, \u201cwhat I can say with more certainty is that these events are likely to end the recent period of relative calm in the stock price,\u201d said Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO at 50 Park Investments. \u201cPositive surprises could fuel a rally, while disappointments might lead to a selloff.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this electric car maker have returned +10.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nTesla is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.46 points to a change of -21.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 indicates a change of +35.4% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $24.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.1%. The $98.24 billion and $113.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.5% and +15.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTesla reported revenues of $21.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.83%. The EPS surprise was -2.17%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Most Futuristic City in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the most futuristic city in the US. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 25 Most Futuristic Cities in the US.\n\nThe most futuristic cities in the US are leading the way in using new technologies to improve urban living. They are using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), green energy, and smart infrastructure to build sustainable cities. These cities connect buildings, vehicles, and devices through IoT networks, promote electric vehicles, and use smart public transportation systems.\n\nThe push for green energy solutions like electric vehicles is important, as the United States Environmental Protection Agency reports that an average passenger vehicle emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of CO2 annually. This estimate is based on the assumption that the average gasoline-powered vehicle currently on the road achieves about 22.2 miles per gallon and travels around 11,500 miles per year. Each gallon of gasoline burned produces about 8,887 grams of CO2.\n\nRecognizing the harmful effects of pollution, cities worldwide are moving towards sustainable solutions to protect the environment. According to Business Fortune Insights,\u00a0the worldwide market for Green Technology and Sustainability is expected to increase from $19.76 billion in 2024 to $89.9 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.9% throughout the forecast period.\n\nThe growth in green technology is driven by the increasing use of Green AI across various sectors. For instance, a data center can consume as much electricity as 50,000 homes, but Green AI enhances energy efficiency by adjusting cooling systems based on real-time data analysis. An example is Google's DeepMind AI, which optimizes data center cooling by analyzing data from multiple sensors. This can help reduce energy consumption by up to 40%.\n\nFurthermore, this growth is supported by key industry players developing sustainable solutions. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a popular example, producing electric vehicles and solar panels through its Tesla Energy Solutions division.\n\nHere\u2019s what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Shares fell 29.3% in the first quarter as the core automotive segment is facing headwinds due to a complex macroeconomic environment, factory shutdowns, growing competitive risks in China, and vehicle price reductions which are pressuring gross margins. During the first quarter of 2024, production was also negatively impacted by the Red Sea maritime supply[1]chain interferences, sabotage in a Tesla factory\u2019s power supply in Berlin, and a factory closure for the launch of the refreshed Model 3. We remain shareholders. Tesla commenced delivery of its highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup, which features new technologies within the car and its manufacturing lines. Tesla also launched version 12 of its Full Self Driving product, which shows significant progress from prior versions and increases the probability that Tesla\u2019s data collection at scale, and verticalized software and hardware approach will position Tesla as a leader in the future for autonomous driving and shared mobility. We also expect energy storage sales to continue to grow over the coming years as the adoption of renewable energy continues. Lastly, we believe Tesla\u2019s core automotive segment will recover with the company remaining a leader in the EV market, which continues to expand with EVs still accounting for only around 10% of vehicle sales globally.\u201d\n\nStory continues The Most Futuristic City in the US\n\nA futuristic multi-server data center, symbolizing the advanced multicloud services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 25 most futuristic cities in the US, we used a consensus methodology and consulted various sources such as Business Insider, BDC Network, Earth.Org, and WealthManagement. We collected information across various metrics related to sustainability, technology, and advanced infrastructure for each of the cities. Following the shortlisting of the cities, we assigned a score to each city based on the number of times it appeared across our sources. In the case of cities having the same score, tiebreaking was done on the basis of which city was outranking the other in our sources. The most futuristic cities in the US have been ranked in ascending order of their scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Most Futuristic City in the US\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nScore: 4\n\nSan Francisco has approximately 119 B corporations, featuring prominent apparel companies such as Birdies Inc. and Athleta. The city also recorded an increase in its median download speed from 92.3 Mbps in 2022 to 133.4 Mbps in 2023, reflecting an increase of 44.5%. The city supports sustainable transportation with 443 EV charging stations, one of the highest numbers in the area. Moreover, all residents in San Francisco have access to a park within a 10-minute walk, and 20% of the city's land is dedicated to parks and recreation. These factors highlight San Francisco's commitment to sustainability, urban livability, and a business community that values environmental and social responsibility.\n\nDiscover which city secured the second spot.

        "title": "Musk won pay package with shareholders' vote, Tesla argues in court filing",
        "content": "Tesla is arguing in a court filing that CEO Elon Musk won the legal battle over his $56 billion pay package because shareholders voted to reapprove the compensation after a Delaware judge voided the compensation plan earlier this year.\n\nThe filing, which was made public Thursday, comes about two weeks after Tesla shareholders voted to approve Musk's compensation plan, which was originally approved in 2018.\n\nChancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery invalidated the pay plan in January after finding that Musk's close relationships with some board members influenced negotiations and that the company failed to adequately explain to shareholders that Tesla was on track to hit many of the plan's performance-based targets.\n\nTesla's filing argues that the judge should issue a final order that finds for the defendants. The company has also sought to lower the amount of legal fees that the attorneys for the shareholder who brought the lawsuit will receive to as low as $13.6 million.\n\nTESLA, OPPONENTS OF MUSK'S PACKAGE CLASH OVER RESOLVING COMPENSATION LAWSUIT\n\nThe attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued to invalidate the pay package, previously asked for 29 million shares of Tesla stock \u2013 an amount worth over $5 billion \u2013 as the legal fee.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIn a filing on Friday, they said Tesla could pay them $1.1 billion as an alternative, which they said would be based on precedent in the Delaware Court of Chancery, although they characterized that amount as \"unfairly low.\"\n\nThe judge on Thursday ordered the two sides to begin preparing briefs outlining their views on the impact of the shareholder vote on the case. She also asked them to agree on a date in late July or early August for oral arguments on the issue.\n\nTESLA SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO REINSTATE MUSK'S $56B PAY PACKAGE\n\nMcCormick will hear oral arguments regarding the legal fee on July 8 and may take a few weeks before issuing a ruling on the matter.\n\nEven if McCormick doesn't reverse her ruling that voided the pay package in January, she may recognize that the shareholder vote to reinstate it showed there was little value in winning the case because Tesla shareholders want Musk to receive the record-breaking compensation.\n\nMUSK DISHES ON TALKS WITH TRUMP DURING TESLA SHAREHOLDER MEETING\n\nThat would undermine the plaintiff's attorneys' fee request, which is based on the value they provided to the company by getting the pay package rescinded.\n\nMusk's pay package, which consists of performance-based targets that trigger stock option awards that he must hold for a period of five years before exercising, was valued at $56 billion at the time the last target was achieved, according to Tesla. The value of the package fluctuates with changes in Tesla's stock price, which is down over 20% year-to-date.\n\nStory continues\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Musk won pay package with shareholders' vote, Tesla argues in court filing\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The AI wars are heating up, and Elon Musk has joined the race. Grok, X\u2019s chatbot, is his answer to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. While Musk has long touted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the top AI stocks due to its self-driving technology, his attention has turned to Grok.\n\nIn May, xAI announced a series B round raising $6 billion from Saudi Arabian Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and others. These funds allow xAI to fast-track its upgrade of Grok to keep up with ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude.\n\nA portion of these funds will go toward employees. With Big Tech companies and startups scrambling for competent engineers, AI talent wars have escalated. It\u2019s now common for compensation for a top AI engineer to exceed $1 million annually.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe remaining funds will go toward infrastructure, such as AI servers, storage and networking. These AI stocks are key suppliers to the xAI Grok project. They will benefit from the increase in capital expenditure by xAI.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the leading provider of AI chips, anyone developing large language models and AI chatbots must build on Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) infrastructure. Musk has relied on the semiconductor\u2019s giant chips for Tesla\u2019s AI projects. Once again, he will resort to Nvidia\u2019s hardware to power Grok.\n\nAccording to the Information, xAI acquired over 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs in 2023 to train its Grok 2 model. However, the chatbot still lags behind the latest GPT 4o or Claude 3.5 performance. Therefore, Elon Musk must invest more in hardware and training to make xAI one of the top AI companies.\n\nMusk estimates that a future iteration, Grok 3, would need more resources, upwards of over 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs to train the model. Truly, these are very expensive chips, costing about $30,000 each. Therefore, orders from xAI will be a huge boost for Nvidia\u2019s revenues.\n\nGoing forward, Nvidia will remain one of the top AI stocks. Its advantage in AI chips at the moment is almost unassailable. It announced the next generation AI chip architecture Blackwell in March at the GTC conference, with deliveries later this year. Ultimately, companies that want to dominate in the AI era want the best hardware \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother immediate beneficiary of Grok\u2019s spending is Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL). The company is well-positioned in the AI server market to meet the needs of cloud service providers and startups like xAI. The latest disclosure that it will assist in powering Grok makes it one of the top AI stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to its engineering advantage and technical differentiation, DELL has emerged as a leader in the AI server market. Customers like Grok favor its customizable solutions that deliver end-to-end solutions. Dell Technologies offers a wholesome AI server solution that includes design, integration, deployment, optimization and support services.\n\nOn June 20, Elon Musk disclosed that DELL was one of the suppliers that will assemble its AI servers. In a post on X, the billionaire disclosed that Dell Technologies was making half of the racks that will go into xAI\u2019s supercomputer. In a follow-up, Michael Dell teased the AI factories they were building in partnership with Nvidia.\n\nLastly, besides Grok, Dell Technologies has hundreds of AI server clients. These customers have outstanding orders that guarantee demand into 2025, making Dell Technologies one of the top AI stocks for 2025. Morgan Stanley thinks DELL\u2019s AI server momentum will accelerate, driving a $200 price target in the bullish case.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been one of the top AI stocks. Although the stock has retreated from its highs above $ 1,200, it is still up by 196% YTD as of this writing. And the gains are far from over since it will enjoy a boost from Grok.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, xAI is building an AI factory to power the latest Grok model. Super Micro Computer is one of the AI stocks that are well-positioned to profit. Particularly, it has a competitive advantage in AI servers with liquid cooling at scale and can ship over 2,000 AI server racks a month.\n\nSo, it came as no surprise when CNBC reported that Super Micro Computer would also supply xAI. It can customize AI server racks to application-specific platforms in accordance with customer needs. Furthermore, its fully functional plug-and-play systems are what xAI needs to scale Grok\u2019s training quickly.\n\nConsidering this revenue boost, Super Micro Computer isn\u2019t done with its rally and has more upside. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) expects the company to profit from strong demand from tier-2 cloud service providers and sovereigns. Their $1,090 price target presents over 25% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Tesla is claiming Elon Musk won his legal battle over his $56 billion pay package because shareholders voted for the compensation, despite a judge rescinding it earlier this year, according to court filing made public on Friday.\n\nThe company's filing comes two weeks after Tesla shareholders voted to ratify the 2018 package of stock options. Tesla held the vote following a January ruling by a Delaware judge to void the compensation because Musk improperly controlled the negotiation process and the company misled shareholders about key details.\n\nThe uncertainty in the case hangs over Musk's relationship with Tesla, which is struggling with slower sales and stiffer competition. He has said he might develop some products outside the company if he does not obtain a larger ownership stake.\n\nTesla made its argument in its proposal for how the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery, should craft a final order that is needed to implement the January ruling. Tesla said the final order should state that \"judgment is entered for the defendants.\"\n\nThe shareholders' legal team wants the judge to stick with her original ruling voiding Musk's pay package. They want her to order Tesla to pay them potentially billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock as a legal fee award.\n\nTesla's has said a fair fee might be as low as $13.6 million.\n\nMcCormick will hear oral arguments over the legal fee on July 8 and she might take at least a few weeks before ruling.\n\nEven if she does not reverse her January ruling, she might recognize that the shareholder vote demonstrated that there was little value in winning the case because Tesla shareholders want the record-breaking compensation. That would undermine the plaintiff's attorneys fee request, which is based on the value they provided to the company by rescinding the pay package.\n\n(Editing by Josie Kao)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The EV Era Continues To Be All About Joining Forces\n\nOn Tuesday, Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) revealed it will be providing Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) with a cash injection of $5 billion. Together, Rivian and Volkswagen are embarking on a joint venture to create vehicle software as they both fight for their place under the EV sun and look for ways to challenge the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\u00a0Volkswagen and Rivian announce a 50/50 win-win venture.\n\nVolkswagen\u00a0will be working with\u00a0Rivian on creating the\u00a0\u201cnext generation software-defined vehicle (SDV) architectures\u201d\u00a0that both will use to build their future EVs. With an immediate investment of $1 billion that is to be followed by $4 billion more through 2026, Volkswagen will be providing the struggling EV maker with the funds it needs to scale up its manufacturing as Rivian is to build a new factory in Georgia.\n\nVolkswagen and Rivian\u00a0plan to launch\u00a0new vehicles utilizing the joint venture\u2019s technologies before\u00a0the end of this decade.\u00a0Rivian\u2019s fundamental vehicle software design is expected to provide the basis for the new company\u2019s software.\u00a0Rivian will license its existing IP rights to the joint venture, allowing\u00a0Volkswagen to boost its tech\u00a0profile and increase its competitiveness on the EV front.\n\nRivian made history by bringing the world\u2019s first electric pickup to the road, doing it even before\u00a0Tesla \u00a0released the long-awaited Cybertruck. But, even the pickup king, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) didn\u2019t solve its EV challenges with the Lightning, the electric version of America\u2019s best-selling pickup. The electric pickup concept continues to evolve, from the vehicle itself to advanced gadgets the bring the game to a whole new level, with Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) launching an Alpha release of its solar-powered tonneau cover this summer. Moreover, Worksport just revealed that SOLIS will not only be charging its power partner, the portable battery system COR but also\u00a0most other portable power stations and power banks on the market. Along with potential\u00a0OEM integrations,\u00a0such as the anticipated collaboration with Hyundai, Worksport promises the SOLIS Cover\u00a0to potentially\u00a0add up to approximately 10 miles of range per day, which would ease the range anxiety of many EV owners. Worksport is set to produce the SOLIS from its state-of-the-art facility in West Seneca, New York, bringing a \"Made in America\" label of excellence to its value proposition.\n\nBack to Rivian, Volkswagen\u2019s fresh infusion of capital will undoubtedly allay concerns of depleting cash reserves as Rivian needs to bridge to the release of its next-generation vehicles, the R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. Even Tesla was forced by the slowdown and fierce competition to bring back its plans of making an affordable EV.\u00a0Rivian also still needs to become profitable.\u00a0In a separate announcement,\u00a0Rivian CEO\u00a0Scaringe told Reuters yesterday that\u00a0the EV maker\u00a0is working to\u00a0improve\u00a0its cost structure and simplify\u00a0production at its Normal\u00a0Illinois\u00a0plant\u00a0by making upgrades to its factory equipment, among other efforts. The collaboration with Volkswagen will undoubtedly help in terms of\u00a0lowering costs and boosting operational efficiency which should both ultimately result in higher gross margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, even Tesla is struggling on its own, having reported a brutal first quarter, seeing its margins dented by the price war it ignited and\u00a0expecting a tough year ahead. Meanwhile, a legacy automaker like Volkswagen was wise to admit it cannot make it in the EV era on its own and change its strategy. This year, it entered into an agreement with XPeng (NYSE: XPEV) in an effort to drive its e-offensive and China and now, it made another effort to catch up on the EV front through Rivian. Unlike Rivian whose shares soared upon the news, its shares slipped on cost concerns. But, the bigger picture is that even the biggest\u00a0European automaker\u00a0realized that partnerships are the way to solidify its\u00a0EV positioning.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. no longer stands above other electric vehicles in quality because head-scratching design changes on its cars, such as removing turn-signal stalks, have frustrated its owners and lowered its score in a bellwether quality survey.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion Supreme Court Ends OxyContin Settlement, Cracking Sackler Shield China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid\n\nLong the EV quality leader, Tesla now is on par with rivals such as Rivian Automotive Inc. and the battery-powered models of legacy automakers like General Motors Co., according to J.D. Power\u2019s Initial Quality Study for the 2024 model year that was released Thursday.\n\nTesla owners complained about changes made to basic functions, like window controls and the horn, which Tesla moved from the center of the steering wheel to a button on the spoke of the wheel in some models. The EV maker also removed turn-signal stalks on some models and put directional arrow buttons on a spoke of the steering wheel instead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not being well received,\u201d Frank Hanley, J.D Power\u2019s senior director of auto benchmarking and author of the study, said in an interview. \u201cIn an emergency situation when you have to hit the horn, you don\u2019t necessarily want to have to think about it. We see customers commenting that eyes-off-the-road time is increasing because they have to hunt around.\u201d\n\nCar buyers and automakers closely watch J.D. Power\u2019s quality study, a long-time measure of the reliability of cars in the first three-months of ownership. This year, J.D. Power added data on how often owners visit car dealers for repairs and information on features like rear emergency braking and back seat reminders, Hanley said. That makes it impossible to directly compare last year\u2019s scores with this year, he said.\n\nRam, Stellantis NV\u2019s truck and van division, topped the rankings, with 149 problems per 100 vehicles, followed by GM\u2019s Chevrolet model line and Hyundai Motor Co.\u2019s namesake brand. Porsche was the top luxury maker with 172 problems per 100 vehicles, followed by Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s Lexus line and Hyundai\u2019s Genesis premium brand.\n\nThe industry average this year was 195 problems per 100 vehicles. Stellantis\u2019 Dodge model line, with 301 problems, was at the bottom of the list of manufacturers that didn\u2019t only make EVs.\n\nBut the pure EV makers scored low on the quality rankings. Tesla and Rivian both had 266 problems per 100 vehicles, while Polestar had the most of any of the brands, at 316 problems per 100 vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nEVs in general have lower quality than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. While EVs have fewer parts to break down, they also tend to be loaded with new technology that can go wrong, Hanley said.\n\nIn fact, he said, EV owners \u201care experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners.\u201d\n\nAs a company, GM performed the best, receiving six awards for having models score at the top of their segment, including the Chevy Equinox ranking as the most problem-free compact sport-utility vehicle and the Chevy Silverado as the top heavy duty pickup truck.\n\nFord Motor Co., which is on a push to improve quality and reduce warranty repair costs that hit $4.8 billion last year, saw improvement in its namesake brand, which ranked ninth overall and was above the industry average. However, its Lincoln luxury line was below average, pulled down by quality problems with the Nautilus SUV Ford is now making in China and shipping to the US, Hanley said.\n\nFord\u2019s redesigned F-150 pickup truck, its top seller, was not included in this year\u2019s J.D. Power study, Hanley said, because the automaker held 60,000 of them for extra quality checks in the first quarter. That omission cut both ways for Ford because the gas-fueled F-150 typically has good quality, while the electric F-150 Lightning has been sub-par, Hanley said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The global prices for lithium carbonate, a rare earth mineral that forms the basis of lithium-ion batteries, have continued their downward trend. In 2023, prices plunged more than 80%, but after that epic slump, investors and traders had been hoping prices had reached a bottom and the market would exhibit signs of recovery.\n\nFor the most part, lithium price growth has been uneven\u00a0with a rally in prices during\u00a0the end of the first quarter and continuous slump since mid-April.\u00a0Waning demand in the electric vehicle (EV) sector is primarily to blame.\u00a0In essence, EV producers are still working through their lithium inventories, which has\u00a0not prompted\u00a0them to purchase more rare earth minerals from their suppliers.\n\nLithium producers, in turn, have seen their margins compress\u00a0and\u00a0public lithium companies have seen their valuations plummet. There are\u00a0signs that the price slump may be nearing a bottom\u00a0and\u00a0EV producers will begin to restock on their lithium supplies, ultimately benefitting miners.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the end of the day, investing\u00a0in\u00a0lithium stocks has to be a long-term game.

The Grota do Cirilo mining operations have been particularly successful. In a May press release, Sigma Lithium revealed that the mine\u2019s provable reserves had increased 40% from 54.8 million tons to 77 million tons, which would effectively increase the life of the mine to 25 years.\n\nSimilar to\u00a0SQM, Sigma Lithium\u00a0is also injecting\u00a0significant amounts of capital into expanding production facilities.According to Sigma Lithium, the expanded reserves of Grota do Cirilo will allow the miner to create a third and potentially fourth facility.\n\nSigma Lithium\u00a0share price is\u00a0around $12.30\u00a0as of\u00a0the end of Monday\u2019s trading session, and the company\u00a0sits at a trading valuation of\u00a018.3x forward earnings.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a lithium ion battery.

        "title": "EU Electric Vehicle Tariff Implications: China Takes The EV Lead",
        "content": "Investing.com - After spectacular gains sales of electric vehicles are struggling in the West, with China taking the lead. This has resulted Western governments proposing tariffs on Chinese EV imports. Barclays takes a look at the situation.\n\nEV Stocks: What\u2019s Happening Globally?\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market has been one of the success stories of the 21st century, with the growth in sales nothing short of remarkable. In 2020, there were 10 million EVs on the road, in 2023 there were 45 million.\n\nBut after years of soaring sales, EV growth appears to be stalling, particularly in the West.\n\nSales of new battery-electric cars in the European Union dropped 12% in May from a year earlier, led by a 30% plunge in Germany.\n\nAdditionally, global sales of the world's largest EV maker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), were actually lower in the first quarter of 2024 than in the same period in 2023.\n\nHowever, China has in many ways avoided the \u201cEV Winter\u201d that has set in upon the West, noted analysts at Barclays, in a note dated June 26.\n\nIndeed, despite facing a more challenging macro situation China has propped up global EV volumes of late and its domestic manufacturers, most notably BYD (SZ:002594), have continued to capture EV market share.\n\nWhereas EVs as a percentage of new car sales are tracking at 17% in Europe and only 9% in the U.S. year-to-date, EV penetration in China is tracking at 36%, with recent months well north of 40%.\n\nThe China EV Advantage: Government Support\n\nThe core driver of the China EV story is significant cost advantage, the U.K. bank said. Indeed, Chinese manufacturers have been profitable on vehicles as cheap as around $10,000 a vehicle, while in the West manufacturers have been losing significant amounts on far more expensive vehicles (i.e. over $50,000).\n\nThis begs a key question \u2013 how did the Chinese EV cost lead emerge?\n\nWhile government support for consumer EV uptake in China still exists, it\u2019s far less direct than in the past \u2013 for instance, instead of EV purchase credits, EV uptake is stoked by way of reduced restrictions for EVs.\n\nYet the support from the Chinese government goes beyond direct subsidies, and more critically reflects the efforts by the government to build a robust EV and battery supply chain, which is far ahead of what exists in the West.\n\nChinese EV battery raw mats and component supply chains have been developed extensively over past years, while China has established a dominant position in the refining/processing of key battery raw mats, even in materials which aren\u2019t all that prevalent domestically, i.e. cobalt and lithium.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis development came in advance of demand and led to the vast majority of global EV batteries and (especially) key components flowing through China.\n\nEV Battery Supply Chain\n\nThe EV battery supply chain has become a key factor, with the lead China has developed supporting lower costs, and raising dependence concerns for the West.\n\nIn 2024 China accounted for around 85% of global battery cell production capacity, with an even greater share in battery components production. This is largely a function of extensive early investments ahead of the broader EV inflection, establishing a mature Chinese EV battery/supply chain ecosystem, with fierce competition on price forcing players in the industry to adapt or be consolidated.\n\nAnother key cost advantage from China\u2019s robust EV ecosystem relates to its sharp lead in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, with the likes of Tesla having plans for all standard range EVs to use LFP cells over time.\n\nImportantly, China accounts for effectively all LFP production globally, and local champion BYD (SZ:002594) uses LFP cells exclusively.\n\nSome efforts to build LFP capacity in North America are underway, but this involves licensing from Contemporary Amperex Technology (SZ:300750), the leading Chinese battery maker, a point of notable contention.\n\nMoreover, in addition to its lead in LFP, China also appears to be leading the industry\u2019s push into new battery technologies, such as sodium-ion cells.\n\nElectric Vehicle Tariffs for US and EU\n\nThe EV Winter has seen a pullback from Western manufacturers, while domestic Chinese manufacturers have been dealing with overcapacity concerns and fierce competition in their home market via growing exports.\n\nThis has prompted Western governments to seek the shielding of their own manufacturers from potential existential risk via tariffs while navigating the geopolitical concerns around China\u2019s EV dominance.\n\nThe United States imposed 100% tariffs on EVs along with a much longer list of 13 items, spanning from raw materials to components and final products.\n\nThe European Union, on the other hand, has announced plans to impose 38.1% tariffs to be added to the 10 percent already in place.\n\nHowever, the EU is set to hold talks with China in early July, with Beijing rejecting accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of its EV industry has been the result of advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains.\n\nEurope paints the most complex case, according to Barclays, as EV imports from China already have a notable presence in Europe, accounting for around 18% of 2023 EV sales.\n\nYet Tesla is a key portion of this (around a third of imports, and about 6% of total sales) and the European brands of Chinese manufacturers made up another third of the imports.\n\nThe European EV share of the domestic Chinese brands (led by BYD) is indeed growing, but still quite modest at around 3% of the market in 2023.\n\nDespite this relatively small mix today the growing focus on exporting to Europe by the Chinese domestics has been scrutinized by the EU, including a months-long investigation into the extent that the EVs are subsidized by the Chinese government.\n\nAt the currently proposed levels, the incremental tariffs are \u201cmanageable\u201d for both EU manufacturers into China and Chinese companies into Europe, the bank added.\n\nChinese EVs sell for a significant premium in the EU relative to their price in China, and given this pricing premium and an increasingly difficult EV market in China, we find that the Chinese EV manufacturers consistently make \"extra profit\" on selling in the EU.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s been estimated that at least an approximate 50% tariff would be needed to make the EU market unattractive for China exports given their cost advantage.\n\nWhat Should EV Investors Buy?\n\nThe clear winners of heightened tariffs on EVs from China would be mass-market manufacturers with minimal China exposure such as Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and Renault (EPA:RENA), as this would support their competitiveness with Chinese imports and their exposure to retaliation would be muted, Barclays said.\n\nOn the other hand, EU manufacturers with more notable exposure to China via exports and local production (i.e. Porsche (ETR:PSHG_p), Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG), Mercedes Benz (ETR:MBGn), BMW (ETR:BMWG), Aston Martin (LON:AML) and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE)) face potential risk from retaliation that may well end up being more severe in terms of relative profitability impacts than what the domestic Chinese manufacturers face from the EU\u2019s tariffs.\n\nDiscover The Top EV Stocks\n\nLooking to assess the performance of EV stocks as part of a diversified portfolio?

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "With EV sales regaining momentum, look at the top EV stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nRemember, as I said yesterday, \u201cFord Motor (NYSE:F) said its\u00a0electric vehicle sales were up 64.7% in May. It also said its EV sales were up nearly 88% higher than year-ago numbers for the first five months of the year. Even General Motors (NYSE:GM) said May was its best month for EV sales ever. Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) said its U.S. EV sales were up 42% in May year over year.\u201d\n\nShould EV sales continue to improve, RMI.org predicts that by 2030, about a third of all cars sold globally will be electric. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), that number could rocket to about 50% by 2035.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll of which makes some of the top EV stocks to buy on the dip even more attractive.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, you\u2019re well aware that lithium is needed to make an electric vehicle. You also know that lithium prices have fallen significantly due to supply-demand issues, which have destroyed related stocks like Albemarle (NYSE:ALB).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s safe to say the lithium pullback has become overkill. Not only are lithium prices starting to bottom out, but lithium is likely to see further heavy demand, combined with growing demand for electric vehicles \u2014 all of which is bullish for ALB.\n\nBetter, ALB is ridiculously oversold at $92.77. It\u2019s over-extended on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R, with a yield of 1.66% to boot. Its latest dividend of $0.40 is payable on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14. In addition, analysts currently rate ALB as a moderate buy with an average price target of $146.13.\n\nIn short, I\u2019d use ALB\u2019s excessive weakness as a buying opportunity. At just $92.77 a share, it\u2019s ridiculously cheap.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen I last mentioned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I said, \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0time to buy the fear. Granted, sales have slipped, but it\u2019s still dominating the market. With EV sales regaining momentum, I\u2019d like to see Tesla initially retest $205 from that last traded price.\u201d\n\nThat was on June 17, when Tesla traded at about $173. Today, it\u2019s up to $187.35 and is still a buy. From here, I\u2019d like to see it rally back to at least $205 in the near term. Helping, as I also noted, \u201cWedbush analysts\u00a0say the $56 billion Elon Musk compensation removes a $20 to $25 overhang on the TSLA stock.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Tesla has a major leg up on its competition. As noted by Business Insider, Tesla is building EVs cheaper than anyone else. Tesla\u2019s input cost per vehicle is less than $30,000 per vehicle, which is about $10,000 less than the industry average. This is also why Tesla dominates the market with high profit margins. We\u2019ll also get a good idea of recent Tesla numbers when the company posts delivery numbers around July 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio\u2019s (NYSE:NIO) weakness is also an opportunity.\n\nAfter running from about $3.61 to a high of $6, it pulled back to $4.37, again oversold. With delivery numbers improving, I\u2019d like to see it rally back to $6.\n\nGranted, recent earnings weren\u2019t so hot.\n\nRevenue fell about 7.2% year over year to $1.37 billion, missing estimates by $70 million. First quarter deliveries were 30,053, down 3.2% year over year. While vehicle margins were up 9.2% from 5.1% year over year, they were down from the 11.9% posted in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, the negativity appears to be baked into the NIO stock.\n\nHelping, JPMorgan recently upgraded the stock from underweight to neutral. The firm believes NIO benefits from its move into batteries and the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to reignite EV demand. NIO sales are also accelerating, with April deliveries up\u00a0134.6% year-over-year.\u00a0Year to date, Nio delivered 45,673 vehicles, a 21.2% jump year over year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Amazon's market cap hit $2tn this week for the first time. (Nathan Stirk via Getty Images)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon's market cap hit $2tn this week for the first time, making it the fifth US company to hit that mark. The bullish sentiment reflects optimism around artificial intelligence and the potential for imminent interest rate cuts.\n\nThe stock rose 3.9% on Wednesday to $193.61, putting it in the same club as technology heavyweights Microsoft Corp, Apple, Nvidia and Alphabet.\n\nUS stock indexes have recorded robust gains this year on relentless enthusiasm around AI, optimism around resilience in the US economy and potential easing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve.\n\nWall Street was trading near record levels, largely powered by megacap stocks, such as Nvidia and Amazon, whose future cash flows stand to benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple saw its stock coast in premarket on Thursday, after having gained 2% in yesterday's session as it rides out a competition probe under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrussels has accused the computing giant of stifling competition with practices in its App Store, marking the first enforcement actions under the new digital rules. The European Commission said earlier this week it was concerned about how Apple's controls on developers limits their ability to \u201cfreely steer their customers\u201d to options outside of the App Store.\n\nMeanwhile, as the tech giant pushes into new tech, Rosenblatt has upgraded Apple to 'buy' from 'neutral' and increased its price target to $260 per share, citing the company's privacy-focused AI initiatives.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed after yen hits 38-year low against dollar\n\nMicron (MU)\n\nChipmaker Micron was hit by AI jitters on Thursday, with its stock 6.8% lower in premarket. The company beat Q3 estimates for revenue but stumbled when it came to forecasts \u2014 disappointing investors.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of $7.6bn, plus or minus $200m, for the current quarter, compared with an estimate of $7.6bn, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's results usually act as a weather vane for earnings in the chip sector, as it acts as an indicator of demand for various types of chips and end-markets.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla stock was down in premarket trade on Thursday, after gaining 4.8% in Wednesday's session. The electric vehicle maker gained this week, despite news that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\n\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall \u2014 11,688 trucks \u2014 which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nThe moves also comes after Musk clinched a reported $210bn valuation for SpaceX. Bloomberg reported the valuation earlier today, following an insight into the value of insider shares being sold in a tender offer.\n\nWatch: Amazon's $2tn market cap, consumer spending: Asking for a trend<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/josh-lipton/\\\">Josh Lipton</a> breaks down the major market trends of the trading day.</p>\\n<p>As inflation has put consumers under pressure, Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva provides insight into <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/top-trends-among-americans-dine-212125686.html\\\">Americans' dining preferences</a>.

        "title": "The Nasdaq Just Notched Another All-Time High, and Cathie Wood Thinks This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Soar Another 1,300%",
        "content": "It's only halfway through 2024, and yet the capital markets are roaring like there's no tomorrow. The Nasdaq Composite is up 19% so far this year, and reached an intraday high of 17,936 just days ago on June 20.\n\nThe Nasdaq is a tech-heavy index. Given the euphoria surrounding all things artificial intelligence (AI), tech stocks in particular have been major contributors to the Nasdaq's red-hot start to the year.\n\nHowever, not all AI opportunities have fared so well. Shares in electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) are down about 20% in 2024. Although concerns about EV demand and competition in the sector linger, one investor in particular is undeterred.\n\nArk Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood recently released a revised price target for Tesla stock. Her base case model is forecasting a price of $2,600 per share in Tesla by 2029 -- implying about 1,300% upside from current trading levels.\n\nLet's dive into Wood's research and assess if Tesla stock is a good opportunity right now.\n\nIt's all about Robotaxi\n\nRight now, Tesla's revenue largely stem from two sources: EVs and energy storage products. Over the years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed that his vision for Tesla includes products in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), both of which will be used to complement the EV business.\n\nOne of the biggest initiatives at Tesla right now is the company's development of autonomous driving software. Dubbed full self-driving (FSD), Musk aims to integrate this technology across Tesla's fleet of EVs. While this is exciting, it's really only the first phase of Musk's long-term vision.\n\nThe broader scope of FSD has become known as Robotaxi. Essentially, Musk wants to create a large-scale fleet of Tesla vehicles that are both fully capable of autonomous driving and constantly in motion at any given time.\n\nThink of it this way: Instead of hailing a taxi in a city or going to rental car service at an airport, you could have the option to just order a Tesla Robotaxi right from your phone. The implications for such a service should not be underappreciated. The advent of a widespread Tesla fleet could completely disrupt ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Lyft, as well as delivery and logistics services from DoorDash and even Amazon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow would Robotaxi help Tesla's overall business?\n\nThe crux of Wood's bullish thesis hinges on a successful launch of Robotaxi. However, understanding the details around the economics of Robotaxi sheds light into why the tech investor is calling for a more than 10-fold increase in Tesla stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Robotaxi may seem like a mere extension of the core EV business, it's actually quite different. When a consumer buys a Tesla, it's highly likely that this is a one-time purchase, or at least one that won't be repeated for a number of years. By contrast, consumers could use Robotaxi services an infinite number of times.\n\nIn essence, Robotaxi will carry much higher gross margins than Tesla's EV operation. Wood describes the margin profile on Robotaxi as akin to a software company, which her research suggests sits at about 80% on average. When compared to the average margin of about 16% for auto makers, it's understandable why Musk is relentlessly focused on launching Robotaxi.\n\nThe compound effect of a high-margin Robotaxi fleet is that this operation could spur a surge in cash flow, which Tesla can then use to reinvest into other projects and further differentiate from the competition.\n\nIs Tesla stock a good buy right now?\n\nI think investors may have soured too much on Tesla, as reflected by the share price decline. Although growth in the EV business is slowing, it's important to remember that the macroeconomy also poses its share of challenges, from lingering inflation to high interest rates. Both of these factors can affect a business in any industry, especially automobiles.\n\nRight now, much of the chatter around Robotaxi is reserved for speculation from Wall Street pundits. However, Tesla is set to make a major announcement on Aug. 8 about Robotaxi.\n\nI see this as a good opportunity for investors to dial in and get a glimpse into Musk's roadmap. I think a prudent strategy for investors is to monitor Tesla's progress as it relates to FSD, EV demand, and the rollout of Robotaxi.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "FREMONT, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Tesla must fix air quality problems at its electric vehicle manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area after racking up more than 100 violations for allegedly releasing toxic emissions into the atmosphere over the last five years, an air quality board said Tuesday.\n\nThe Bay Area Air Quality Management District planned to issue a written abatement order later this week after Tuesday's announcement. Each of the 112 violations can emit hundreds of pounds of illegal air pollution, the board said.\n\nThe plant is in the city of Fremont, in the East Bay, and the agency's independent hearing board pointed to the facility's paint shop operations as a specific problem. The board has ordered Tesla to hire an independent consultant and develop a proposed implementation plan for approval, which it then must execute to stop the toxic emissions.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s ongoing violations at their Fremont facility pose a risk to public health and air quality in the surrounding community,\u201d Philip Fine, executive officer of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, said in a news release. \u201cThis order is crucial to ensure that Tesla takes prompt and effective action to stop harmful emissions and comply with all air quality regulations to protect the health of those living near the facility.\u201d\n\nTesla's public relations department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nIn February, a California judge ordered the company to pay $1.5 million as part of a settlement of a civil case alleging the company mishandled hazardous waste at its car service centers, energy centers and a factory.\n\nThe complaint filed in San Joaquin County alleged illegal disposal of hazardous waste and violation of laws involving the storage and management of the waste. Prosecutors said Tesla cooperated with the investigation and acted to improve compliance with laws that were brought to its attention by the prosecutors.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Why has Tesla Underperformed?\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Tesla is the leading EV maker in the world and has rewarded shareholders with gains of more than 15,000% since going public in 2010. However, the road to profitability has been difficult for investors. Throughout the company\u2019s history, Tesla (TSLA) has been plagued by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Furthermore, the company has its fair share of detractors and is perennially among the most highly shorted stocks on Wall Street. The year 2024 is no different for the stock \u2013 shares are down more than 20% year-to-date as shrinking automotive margins and a cooling EV market have weighed shares down.\n\nIs now the time to bet on a turnaround in the stock? Five bull catalysts hint at a turnaround and suggest the answer to that question is yes, including:\n\nThe EV maker\u2019s revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y Refresh will support sales. Like fashion, the automotive industry is a game of \u201cwhat have you done for me lately?\u201d Tesla will revamp its two most popular models in 2024 and a refreshed vehicle line should help to support sales in the coming quarters.\n\nDespite the recent pullback in the Nasdaq, Tesla is up more than 5% for the week \u2013 a sign of relative price strength. Few better signals exist than a stock that bucks the market trend. If TSLA can rise in a falling market, it will likely soar in a bullish market.\n\nTesla\u2019s Robotaxi event is set for August 8th and should be a bullish catalyst for the stock. Elon Musk is betting the company on its Robotaxi plans. If history acts as a precedent, Musk\u2019s bet will pay off. Elon Musk has a long history of making bold bets that pay off in the long term.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla\u2019s price-to-sales ratio has plunged from over 30 to ~7, making shares cheap from a valuation perspective. If the company\u2019s earnings rebounds as I expect, Tesla will morph into a classic growth at a reasonable price (GARP) play.\n\nTesla deliveries have shown signs of a turnaround, and the July 2nd delivery announcement should be a tailwind for the stock.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf Elon Musk and Tesla can execute on their new plan, investors should expect shares to rise much higher in 6-12 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "China\u2019s EV Success Story Built on Price Wars, Tesla Factor",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China became a world leader in electric vehicles by showering companies with public cash. It\u2019s a charge increasingly heard in the US and Europe, and a refrain that\u2019s central to the escalating trade war.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho YouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid FedEx Stokes Investors With Hint of a Freight Deal Volkswagen Invests $5 Billion in EV Startup Rivian to Form Joint Venture\n\nIf it were only that simple, China would have champions in every industry, from aircraft to semiconductors. The unique rise of China\u2019s EV makers, which are rapidly taking over the world despite Western politicians\u2019 efforts to block them, holds lessons for other countries about how industrial policy can succeed.\n\nWhile Beijing plowed in plenty of money after identifying EVs as crucial for the environment and the economy, to a large degree it was a foreign company that kickstarted the domestic industry \u2014 an argument against the protectionism that China has insisted on in many other sectors. Although former government minister Wan Gang pushed the country early on to leapfrog the dominance of foreign brands by investing in electric cars, when Tesla Inc. started manufacturing locally in China in 2019, it sparked genuine enthusiasm among consumers and fueled the build-out of an entire EV supply chain.\n\nInnovation became the catch cry and scores of EV makers blossomed, each trying to outdo the other on design, software and other high-tech features. Many fell by the wayside, leaving survivors leaner and hungrier. In 2024, China\u2019s EV market is characterized by bruising price wars and intense competition.\n\nThe policies employed by China\u2019s leaders are now being emulated by Western governments, which are trying to make their own EV makers more competitive, including with subsidies. Yet it\u2019s clear that Beijing\u2019s willingness to let companies fail while boosting the overall new-energy vehicle sector is what\u2019s made a difference. In contrast, its decades-long commitment to manufacturing homegrown aircraft to take on Boeing Co. and Airbus SE hasn\u2019t seen Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd. make many viable inroads into that global duopoly.\n\nIn EVs, China hasn\u2019t sought to \u201ccreate specific national champions,\u201d said Gerard DiPippo, a senior geo-economics analyst at Bloomberg Economics. \u201cIt wanted winners but didn\u2019t want to pick them. It was more of a \u2018let one hundred EV makers bloom\u2019 approach.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThat strategy has seen carmakers like BYD Co. offer electric hatchbacks that have rotating touchscreens from just 73,800 yuan ($10,200). Li Auto Inc.\u2019s L-Series has rocketed to the top of electric SUV charts thanks to its spacious interiors and top notch in-car entertainment. While Apple Inc. gave up on its EV project, Xiaomi Corp. founder Lei Jun has fans queuing up to buy the smartphone maker\u2019s recently released SU7 EV.\n\nSome of these automakers may even have a shot at becoming the next Toyota Motor Corp. \u2014 BYD, which produced more than 3 million cars last year, overtook Tesla in the fourth quarter as the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs \u2014 and China\u2019s economy is getting a lift at the same time.\n\nInnovation in EVs has also rippled into surrounding areas, including batteries and supply-chain optimization.\n\nThe government effectively excluded foreign battery manufacturers from the market for a time when the industry was still developing, creating a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of approved cell makers that could supply local EV manufacturers. But the list was abolished in 2019 and in the first four months of 2024, BYD and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, had a combined global EV battery market share of 53.1%, according to Seoul-based SNE Research. And at a recent press briefing, a Commerce Ministry official boasted that electric carmakers in the Yangtze River Delta near Shanghai can get all the parts they need within a four-hour window.\n\nWith China\u2019s government having called time on growth driven by real estate and infrastructure, the EV industry is delivering. It\u2019s on track to contribute 2.7% of gross domestic product by 2026, Bloomberg Economics estimates. That\u2019s nine times as much as in 2020, although still not enough to fill the gap left by China\u2019s burst housing bubble.\n\nLonger term, automakers could contribute even more \u2014 but there are obstacles to their global advance. US tariffs of 100% effectively shut them out of that market and the European Union this month announced plans that take duties as high as 48%. Both have cited Beijing\u2019s financial backing for the industry and the overcapacity it\u2019s encouraged.\n\nIt would be a mistake however for Western policymakers to conclude that subsidies are a magic bullet, Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight, said.\n\nSubsidies alone \u201cnever create a healthy industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason for China\u2019s success is more product driven and demand driven.\u201d After the US led the way with Tesla, \u201cChina ran faster and the Europeans slowed down,\u201d he said.\n\nRunning faster can take a toll. Chinese brands are under constant pressure to refresh and upgrade, sometimes as often as every 18 to 24 months \u2014 a rate unthinkable elsewhere. In Europe, it might be more like every four to five years. The frenetic pace can leave employees burned out.\n\n\u2018Stark Contrast\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s need to bring down heavy pollution in cities played a crucial role in its EV policy. Generous subsidies went to buyers to incentivize them to switch to electric cars, creating a demand-led cycle rather than a supply glut.\n\n\u201cThe government came in at a time when the EV industry was still quite young, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of competition,\u201d Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. \u201cBut it was mature enough to actually be able to make very rapid progress.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to the US, which preferred to let market forces determine whether EVs would become a viable alternative, according to Paul Triolo, a former US government official who specializes in China and technology policy at Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nChina managed to create \u201can air of inevitability\u201d around the uptake of EVs, he said. \u201cBeijing\u2019s approach was to provide sustained subsidies, encourage private sector players to jump in and compete and then gradually withdraw support as the most innovative and capable private sector players emerged from the fray.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s helping hand ranged from investment in charging infrastructure \u2014 even when the number of EVs on the roads was minuscule \u2014 to introducing preferential license-plate policies.\n\nAsia\u2019s biggest economy has also become especially strong in batteries, the biggest reason why its EV firms have a cost edge over rivals, Herbert Crowther, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said.\n\n\u201cChinese battery firms are reaching price levels that are surprising to even the biggest foreign competitors and which could completely change the traditional economics of EV input costs,\u201d he said. That success stems from programs to secure supplies of the raw materials needed in EV cells, an area where \u201cChinese policy is also effective and where Western industrial policy will probably continue to struggle.\u201d\n\nFuture leaps forward for China could come in any number of areas, from AI to renewable energy or bio-pharmaceuticals. Ultimately, it will be up to the nation\u2019s scientists and entrepreneurs \u2014 not officials \u2014 to make things happen.\n\nWinners will be made by \u201cgovernments that create an environment for innovation,\u201d Scott Kennedy, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. That will allow \u201cthe potential for breakthroughs by companies to eventually find a place in the market.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Linda Lew, Chunying Zhang, James Mayger and Danny Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along Why BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors are certainly finding no shortage of stock darlings in which to invest right now. However, the list of such hyper-growth stocks has changed quite a bit in recent years. In other words, the stock darlings of 2020 and 2021 are not necessarily today\u2019s winners.\n\nThe three companies on this list of stock darlings to consider diversifying away from have mixed outlooks and recent performance. Some have performed relatively well of late, and others are already seeing fundamentals deteriorate. But each of these three stock darlings are similar in the sense that I think the outlook over the next five years or so will likely be increasingly challenging for these companies.\n\nHere are three such stocks I think investors may want to steer clear of right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter seeing considerable share price appreciation over the past year, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares are starting to appear pricey to some investors. With a trailing price-earnings (P/E) multiple around 46-times, Netflix is certainly pricing in a considerable amount of growth.\n\nHowever, with so much cost cutting already haven taken place, and the likely need to spend more on content moving forward, margin pressures may materialize. And that could derail the company\u2019s recent earnings growth and high return on equity that Netflix has seen relative to its peers.\n\nDespite slightly stable financials, Netflix will cease reporting subscriber numbers by Q1 of 2025, signaling a shift towards service optimization over subscriber count. This strategic change aims for long-term profitability but may initially slow subscriber growth and impact stock value.\u00a0 Additionally, Netflix has opted not to issue regular dividends, directing all profits back into business reinvestment, driving its impressive earnings growth.\n\nNevertheless, the company\u2019s multiple in combination with its cash flow uncertainty make this a stock that\u2019s worth waiting on right now. If NFLX stock drops low enough, I think it could be a buy. But at this valuation, I\u2019m skeptical.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nProfiting from artificial intelligence (AI) hardware trends, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is an AI stock that most people think complements to other AI chips like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). MU anticipates robust demand for high-bandwidth memory amid Samsung\u2019s chip issues, boosting its capital expenditure by 6.7% to $8 billion.\n\nThe memory market\u2019s volatile history once featured fierce competition among numerous players. Over time, consolidation reduced rivals, fostering hopes of stable profitability for memory firms. However, these hopes were dashed when demand for computers and smartphones declined in 2023, adversely affecting MU\u2019s finances.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, analysts project a return to breakeven this year, yet challenges persist with Micron Technology\u2019s shares trading at over 150-times forward earnings. While AI has been highlighted as a growth driver for the company, its contribution remains modest within Micron Technology\u2019s broader business landscape. I believe MU stock is highly overvalued right now due in large part to its 78% increase in stock price last year.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSeeing a 28% decline in the first half of 2024, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is only proving its stock price can\u2019t really be justified.\n\nTrading $196 per share and a market cap of $589 billion, Tesla\u2019s momentum is clearly to the downside. With more car buyers turning their attention to hybrids and lower-cost EVs, Tesla\u2019s demand profile has shifted considerably. Importantly, the company\u2019s price cutting measures have done little to stimulate demand, with an excessive amount of inventory now building up on lots across the company.\n\nIn March, hedge fund manager Per Lekander warned in a CNBC article that Tesla might go as low as $14 and could go bankrupt. Lekander gave these words after Tesla\u2019s disappointing Q1 results, especially its lower-than-expected deliveries.\n\nLekander\u2019s pessimistic outlook on Tesla extended to predicting a potential drop in its stock price to $14 per share. He also thinks the forecast for Tesla\u2019s earnings will go down to $1.40 per share per year, showing slow growth. Lekander thinks Tesla\u2019s valuation should be based on 10x earnings.\n\nAside from the numbers, Tesla is struggling with its sales as other EV companies are providing more affordable alternatives to its models. I think Tesla stands to be among the biggest laggards in the mega-cap tech space for some time. There are just so many better high growth options out there. Put simply, Tesla isn\u2019t the growth stock it once was.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Smartest Battery Stocks to Buy With $200 Right Now",
        "content": "Battery stocks to buy are tough to overlook, considering the global push towards a sustainable energy future.\n\nOf late, though, we\u2019ve seen a sharp pullback in battery stock valuations following the slowdown in the broader EV market. Additionally, Bloomberg\u2019s EV Outlook for the year highlights a mixed landscape in the global EV space. While EV sales are rising overall, the pace of growth varies by region and segment. Additionally, multiple automotive players have had to adjust their timelines for EV goals, pointing to a muffled landscape.\n\nHowever, from a long-term perspective, the battery market remains poised for robust annual growth of 16.7% leading up to 2030. That said, these three battery stocks stand out at attractive price points and have strong upside potential. These stocks are positioned exceptionally in their niche and primed for substantial long-term returns, making them top-value picks now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBattery Stocks to Buy: Albemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)\u00a0has been a leading lithium supplier for EVs over the past few years. What gives it the edge over its competition is its interest in bromine and catalysts markets, complementing its lithium segment.\n\nDespite a major correction in the lithium space, Albemarle\u2019s focus on liquidity preservation positions it well during volatile times. Moreover, besides its projected $280 million in productivity benefits, ALB boasts a robust liquidity reserve of $3.7 billion as of March.\n\nFurthermore, a decent head of steam has been building in commodity markets, with gold, oil, and natural gas leading the way. Hence, we could potentially see a comeback in the lithium space during the second-half of the year. Also, Albemarle recently unveiled promising developments in its North Carolina lithium mining project. Therefore, it\u2019s an ideal time for patient investors to invest in ALB stock, as it is positioned for stellar growth once lithium demand escalates.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFF) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFF) is an OG player in the battery space, known for its high-profile collaboration with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, we\u2019ve recently seen the battery market advance its footprint with ambitious independent initiatives. The firm plans to expand its battery production capacity from 50Gwh at the beginning of the year to an enormous 200Gwh by March 2031.\n\nOn the innovation front, Panasonic continues pioneering advanced battery technologies. The firm is actively developing cobalt-free battery options boasting an energy density of 1,000 Wh/l. Additionally, Panasonic plans to release a new iteration of EV battery cells with greater energy capacity this year, aiming for a 25% jump in energy density from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, Panasonic has plenty on its table, and it stands to expand its presence significantly in the EV battery realm. Its recent strategic moves underscore the firm\u2019s massive potential to deliver greater productivity and lower costs in EVs, making it a compelling battery stock option.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) represents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity in the battery stock space. \u00a0Though its stock is up more than 13% year-to-date (YTD), it\u2019s still trading 49% behind its 52-week highs. Hence, those looking to wager on SLDP stock need to have a taste for high-stakes opportunities.\n\nSLDP is spearheading the development of solid-state batteries\u2014often hailed as the holy grail for EVs. Should these groundbreaking batteries reach commercialization, they could potentially deliver multi-bagger returns.\n\nThe firm is set to deliver on its ambitious goal of launching improved A-2 cells this year, following the successful delivery of its A-1 cells to its partners last year. A key factor that has analysts bullish over its prospects is its financial backing from the likes of BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Ford (NYSE:F). BMW, in particular, has gone one step further and is licensing SLDP\u2019s technology. Moreover, earlier this year, SLP expanded its collaboration with SK On, which will now license SLDP\u2019s solid-state cell designs and manufacturing processes.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Is this the Tesla robotaxi killer? Meet the 'Verne.'",
        "content": "Watch out Elon Musk. There\u2019s another robotaxi play in town \u2014 and it\u2019s backed by a highly-regarded name in the business of EVs.\n\nElectric vehicle tech and hypercar maker Rimac has launched \"Verne,\" an autonomous robotaxi startup named after author Jules Verne, the \"father of science fiction.\" Verne (the startup) debuted its futuristic EV robotaxi at an event in Rimac\u2019s hometown of Zagreb, Croatia. The sleek vehicle appears similar in size to a VW Golf, with a premium interior and Mobileye technology.\n\nVerne is an \u201cecosystem\u201d that includes three interrelated parts: an autonomous EV, a mobile-based app that consumers use to summon the robotaxi, and an infrastructure system called, as the company puts it, the \u201cMothership.\u201d That's where the robotaxis will be serviced and maintained.\n\nVerne will launch in Zagreb in 2026 with an aim to deploy the robotaxis worldwide. The Verne autonomous EV (credit: Verne) (Verne)\n\nBut a key factor in the Verne formula \u2014 which makes the startup one Tesla (TSLA) needs to keep an eye on \u2014 is its main backer: Mate Rimac, the founder of his eponymous company. He's one of three founders alongside Verne CEO Marko Pejkovi\u0107 and designer Adriano Mudri.\n\n\u201c[Verne] is a service that will be tailored to your needs in every possible way,\" Mate Rimac said in a statement. \u201cWe are shifting the attention from the technology itself to its benefits.\u201d Looking good: A view of the Verne autonomous EV. (Verne) (Verne)\n\nMate Rimac is no slouch in the EV world. He started his EV company, Rimac Automobili, in 2011 at the age of 23. The company\u2019s $2.2 million Nevera EV hypercar has won numerous awards, and its innovative tech, from motors to inverters and other EV infrastructure, has been licensed to automakers like BMW.\n\nRimac, who an auto industry source calls \u201cElon Musk without the baggage,\u201d is quietly building his empire. Rimac also recently entered a joint venture called Bugatti-Rimac with Porsche (POAHY), which owns luxury automaker Bugatti, of which Mate will be CEO. Is the world ready? Inside the Verne. (credit: Verne) (Verne)\n\nNow Rimac has thrown its hat in the robotaxi ring, crucially a few months before Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s Aug. 8 debut of its taxi.\n\nMusk has been adamant that Tesla\u2019s robotaxi is key to unlocking trillions in additional value for the company. The question is whether Tesla\u2019s offering will rival Rimac and its Verne autonomous EV.\n\nThe Verne EV looks the part and offers a luxurious interior, which at this point appears more plush than Tesla\u2019s Model 3 or Model Y. The car uses sliding doors for ease of entry, and while there are no pedals, steering wheel, or traditional dashboard to speak of, there is instead a 43-inch widescreen display for infotainment purposes. For Tesla, rumors suggest a Cybertruck-like industrial look for the Musk\u2019s robotaxi, which could be controversial.\n\nStory continues The Verne mobile app (Verne) (Verne)\n\nUnder the hood (so to speak), the Verne EV is utilizing Mobileye\u2019s autonomous driving package \u2014 which can supposedly operate fully on its own in urban settings, using a combination of cameras, LIDAR, and radar sensors. Verne and Rimac are promising Level 4 autonomy, meaning the car is in full control but in only certain conditions \u2014 for instance in city or urban driving with a geofenced operating area.\n\nWith Rimac\u2019s expertise in EV componentry and manufacturing, building the Verne EV should not be an issue. Verne is targeting a 2026 release for the robotaxi product, with expansion coming next to cities in UK and Germany, and the Middle East after that. Verne said it also has agreements with 11 cities in the EU, UK, and Middle East, with negotiations ongoing with 30 more cities that are interested in the Verne service.\n\nLet the Hunger Games of the robotaxi world begin.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

Michael Bow reports:\n\nAs part of the investigation, investigators seized a range of assets from Mr Benko\u2019s mansion in Innsbruck, including a Porsche sportscar.\n\nIt comes as Mr Benko faces allegations of embezzlement, fraud and fraudulent bankruptcy.\n\nThe claims emerged following the collapse of Signa last year, which filed for the largest bankruptcy in the country\u2019s history.\n\nPlunging property prices and high interest rates put the squeeze on Signa\u2019s highly indebted property portfolio, prompting a debt crunch and subsequent collapse of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead the full story...

Questions also remain about whether the two companies will be able to align culture and strategies.\n\n\u201cCariad should and will disappear. The reality is it\u2019s going to become irrelevant and die a natural death,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois, adding that no other legacy carmaker had managed to build a competitive software offering alone.\n\nStill, Houchois welcomed the change in strategy signalled by the deal. \u201cThe old VW would have kept throwing money at the problem - the new VW with [chief executive Oliver] Blume is more pragmatic and humble, looking for help elsewhere.\u201d\n\n05:36 PM BST\n\nBritish banker handed record \u00a39.5m payday by Japanese lender\n\nA British banker has pocketed a record $12m (\u00a39m) payout from lender Nomura \u2013 three times more than that of his Japanese boss. Michael Bow reports:\n\nVeteran banker Christopher Willcox scooped the highest-ever payday for an executive working for the Japanese finance giant after the lender swung back to profit.\n\nMr Willcox runs the company\u2019s wholesale bank from New York, making him responsible for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), trading and underwriting activities, all of which typically reap the largest rewards in the world of banking.\n\nHe was paid $12m for the year ending March 2024, up from $5.5m the year prior, according to a new Nomura filing.\n\nMr Willcox\u2019s payout may raise eyebrows internally, given that it is significantly higher than that of Kentaro Okuda, the Nomura chief executive, who received 506m yen last year (\u00a32.5m).\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:11 PM BST\n\nTraders may \u2018attempt to test the resolve of the Japanese authorities\u2019, says analust, as yen hits 38-year low\n\nThe yen, weakened by the Japanese government\u2019s easy monetary policy, hit a 38-year low against the dollar today, sparking speculation about a new intervention by authorities.\n\nThe yen slid as far as 160.75 to the greenback.\n\nThere is no indication that authorities have intervened to support the yen, market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation said.\n\n\u201cThis being the case, it\u2019s possible that traders work to push the yen lower in a renewed attempt to test the resolve of the Japanese authorities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Asian country\u2019s top currency official has said authorities were ready to act 24 hours a day if the unit fell too far, but some investors suspect that the new trigger may be 165 yen to the dollar.\n\nBillions were pumped in to support the yen after it hit a 34-year low of 160.17 in late April, but with limited effect.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said:\n\nIf the Japanese finance ministry sees FX [foreign exchange] intervention as a waste of money, then they may let the yen continue to weaken, and leave it up to the BOJ [Bank of Japan] at the end of July to boost the yen with monetary policy tightening.\n\nTraders are also poring over any comments from the Bank of Japan, which many say has been too cautious in moving away from its ultra-loose monetary policy. It is tipped to hike interest rates next month.\n\n05:06 PM BST\n\nFootsie closes down as global markets fall\n\nThe FTSE 100 dropped 0.3pc today.

It hit its highest level since February 2017 on the day after president Emanuel Macron called a snap election.\n\n\u201cIf National Rally wins a relative majority, we likely see tightening in French government bond (yield spreads),\u201d said Gordon Shannon, partner and portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management, arguing that Le Pen has made the right noises about working with Macron\u2019s government \u201cso the market won\u2019t jump straight to pricing in a fiscal crisis\u201d.

        "title": "After 4 Cybertruck recalls in 5 months, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla may soon lose more of its luster",
        "content": "Tesla just can\u2019t shake those quality problems with its Cybertruck.\n\nThe first recall came at the end of January, thanks to a warning-light font size that was too small, which could have caused crashes, though Tesla said there was no record of any happening. This was easily fixed with an over-the-air software update, unlike the next recall in April, when Tesla had to physically fix the vehicle because its accelerator pedal could\u2014and did\u2014get stuck, causing surprise acceleration.\n\nBut yesterday, Elon Musk truly spoiled his critics with not one but two Cybertruck recalls, both of the this-needs-to-come-in variety.\n\nTesla paused Cybertruck shipments a couple weeks back, with some reports saying there was a windshield wiper issue. Accordingly, one of the recalls is because \u201cexcessive electrical current can cause the front windshield wiper motor controller to fail\u2026increasing the risk of a crash.\u201d The wiper motor needs to be replaced. It\u2019s not clear if there were any crashes because of this, but there were multiple reports of the wipers failing.\n\nThe other recall is because the Cybertruck\u2019s sail applique\u2014the long strip of plastic lining on top of the sides of the truck bed\u2014was badly installed in some vehicles. The cosmetic piece fell off in at least two instances and had the potential to create a road hazard for people driving behind the truck.\n\nThat\u2019s four recalls\u2014three physical\u2014in just five months. It\u2019s only been seven months since people first took delivery of the thing. Like the Cybertruck itself, it\u2019s not a good look. (Your mileage may vary; nearly 12,000 Cybertrucks have been delivered, suggesting plenty of people do like its early-PlayStation-graphics design.)\n\nTesla\u2019s investors, who recently decided that Musk deserves a $50-something-billion pay package, remain very patient people. There was barely a blip in the rise of the company\u2019s share price, which ended Tuesday up 2.6% and continued its ascent this morning (the stock is down over 30% this year.)\n\nWhat\u2019s likely to be of more interest to them is Tesla\u2019s next overall shipment figures, which are expected to arrive early next week. Wall Street consensus has deliveries down to 440,000 from 466,000 last year, though some analysts say you could lop off another 20,000 or so.\n\nOn top of that, other carmakers will also soon report their Q2 shipments and, as Bloomberg reports, it is quite possible that Tesla will no longer be the electric car company that sells more in the U.S. than all its rivals combined. Its Q1 sales were already down 13%, while the likes of Ford and Hyundai soared.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is not a favorable trajectory, but perhaps it is natural\u2014in an expanding market, an early lead may not last forever.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Short Sellers Destroyed As Volkswagen Gives Rivian a $5 Billion Boost",
        "content": "After soaring to a record high just days after its November '21 IPO (at $78/share), the fate of EV maker Rivian had been a brutal one-way masterclass in disappointment after disappointment, with the price trading near record lows in recent months, and flirting with single digits, down 93% from the all time high of $172 hit in November 2021.\n\nSo one can almost feel happy for the long-suffering RIVN longs who saw their stock price surge more than 50% after hours when Germany's largest car company Volkswagen announced it would invest $5 billion to form a joint venture with Rivian, throwing a lifeline to the struggling startup and giving the German automaker access to the American EV company\u2019s technology.\n\nAs part of the investment, VW said it will invest $1 billion immediately in Rivian and an additional $4 billion over time. The new venture will be \u201cequally controlled and owned\u201d and aims to develop \u201cnext generation\u201d battery-powered vehicles and software, VW and Rivian said in a joint statement..\n\nThe strategic alliance provides the cash incinerating Rivian with a much-needed source of new capital after the company has struggled to ramp up production and deliveries of its electric pickup and SUV models. It comes ahead of Rivian\u2019s previously-scheduled investor day on Thursday.\u00a0 For VW, the German car giant gets access to the EV startup\u2019s software and EV architecture after years struggling to roll out plug-in vehicles with efficiency and functionality on par with those from Tesla.\n\nAs part of the deal, Volkswagen will take an initial $1 billion equity stake in Rivian through an unsecured convertible note that will exchange into Rivian shares on or after Dec. 1. That would make Volkswagen the company's second largest shareholder after Amazon.com, which will remain Rivian\u2019s largest investor with a 16% stake valued at nearly $2 billion as of Tuesday\u2019s close (and $3 billion following news of the venture).\n\nVW will then invest an additional $2 billion in Rivian shares via two equal tranches in 2025 and 2026, and will put an additional $2 billion into the joint venture through a payment at the venture\u2019s inception and a loan available in 2026.\n\nOn a conference call, Rivian Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said he and VW CEO Oliver Blume, shared an \u201cimmediate realization\u201d the two were aligned on product strategy soon after they initially met. That led to conversations about working together, he said.\n\n\u201cThrough our cooperation, we will bring the best solutions to our vehicles faster and at lower cost,\u201d Blume said in the companies\u2019 statement. \u201cWe are strengthening our technology profile and our competitiveness.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian went public in November 2021 at the peak of enthusiasm for the speedy arrival of the EV future, seen as a potentially competitor to Tesla. Sure enough, an early rise in Rivian shares briefly gave it a market value exceeding that of Ford and General Motors, but since then, many of its fellow EV startups have fallen by the wayside as mainstream car buyers turned away from pricey EVs. Rivian has struggled to find a path to profitability and generate enough cash flow to fund its future.\n\nThat said, one would not be shocked if today's tie up ends up in flames similar to the catastrophic JV between GM and the fraud that was Tesla, where Mary Barra did precisely zero diligence before investing millions in the soon to be defunct company.\u00a0 And indeed, Rivian has seen attempted partnerships with established automakers collapse before. In November 2021, it abandoned plans to jointly develop EVs with Ford, an early investor. And in December 2022, it shelved a deal to build electric vans with Mercedes-Benz AG.\n\nFor VW, the German automotive giant gets access to the EV startup\u2019s software and EV architecture after years struggling to roll out plug-in vehicles with efficiency and functionality on par with those from Tesla Inc.\n\nBoth companies plan to introduce vehicles featuring technology created by the joint venture in the second half of this decade, according to the companies\u2019 joint statement.\n\nRivian stock exploded after hours, surging as much as 55%...\n\n... on what is as much a kneejerk response to the news, as an epic short squeeze. As we noted earlier, some 133 million RIVN shares are currently short, just shy of the all time high, and some 16.4% of the float.\n\nAnd if indeed Germany's largest carmaker is aggressively expanding into EVs in the US, then is it time to look at downstream beneficiaries, where one name sticks out: with a record short interest of 112 million, or a whopping 28% of the float short, is Chargepoint, another name that has been largely left for dead (market cap of only $500 million), about to squeeze into the stratosphere next?\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s Secret Project: A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle Natural Gas Outlook Mixed Amid Volatile European Markets China Puts Limits on 'No-Limits' Friendship' With Russia\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Recalls Nearly 12K Cybertrucks in Latest Setback",
        "content": "Tesla, Inc. TSLA has issued two additional recalls for its Cybertruck pickups in the United States. The automaker still struggles with the challenges associated with the new EV roughly six months after deliveries began.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth recalls for the Cybertruck require physical repairs, necessitating appointments with Tesla service centers. One recall addresses issues with trim pieces that can loosen and fall off the trunk, while the other involves faulty motor controllers in the front windshield wipers. Nearly all of the 12,000 Cybertrucks on the road are affected by the recall.\r\n\r\nPer a report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), if a trim piece detaches while driving, it could create a road hazard and increase the risk of injury or collision for other motorists. Tesla plans to replace or rework the trim piece to ensure sufficient adhesion.\r\n\r\nPer another report by NHTSA, some vehicles have a front windshield wiper motor controller that may fail due to electrical overstress, reducing visibility and increasing the risk of a collision. Tesla will replace the motor controller for affected customers. Cybertruck owners will be asked to bring their trucks to a service center for these repairs, with notifications beginning in mid-August.\r\n\r\nThe Cybertruck, unveiled by CEO Elon Musk four years ago and initially slated for production two years later, began limited deliveries in November during a launch event in Austin, TX.\r\n\r\nPrevious Cybertruck recalls include an April recall for a sticking accelerator pedal and a January software recall for 2.2 million vehicles, including Cybertrucks, due to small warning light letters, which was resolved with an over-the-air software update.\r\n\r\nThe Cybertruck, Tesla\u2019s first entry in the U.S. pickup market, competes with the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T.\r\n\r\nPer Tesla, the Cybertruck production capacity exceeded 125,000 units per year. During Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk announced a record of 1,300 Cybertruck shipments in one week. The company is going through a broad restructuring, including a headcount reduction of at least 14%.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nTSLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Blue Bird Corporation BLBD, Oshkosh Corporation OSK and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "Rivian founder tells investors why incoming shareholder Volkswagen needs his help to take on Tesla just as much as he needs the cash injection",
        "content": "Volkswagen\u2019s planned $5 billion investment in Rivian is a lifeline for the troubled carmaker\u2014but not necessarily the one you may think.\n\nThe\u00a0cash injection plugs a hole in Rivian\u2019s spending plans, providing much-needed investor confidence in founder R.J. Scaringe at a critical juncture when other EV startups like Fisker are declaring bankruptcy.\n\nBut the world\u2019s second-largest carmaker isn\u2019t helping a U.S. rival out of some altruistic notion to drive the adoption of zero-emission electric vehicles.\n\nIt\u2019s flat-out desperate after years of effort and billions of dollars spent trying to narrow Tesla\u2019s competitive edge in the crucial field of vehicle software with nothing to show.\n\nIn exchange for the money, Scaringe will grant Volkswagen access to its so-called single stack software architecture, which can affect changes in every part of the vehicle from top to bottom, just like Tesla.\n\n\u201cWhat we realized over the last few years is the enormous difficulty for incumbent existing auto manufacturers to develop their own full stack software,\u201d Scaringe told\u00a0investors on Tuesday.\n\nThis is exciting! Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume and I are thrilled to announce the formation of a joint venture between our two companies. This partnership brings Rivian\u2019s software and zonal electronics platform to a broader market through Volkswagen Group\u2019s global reach and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/11XVNUo89J\n\n\u2014 RJ Scaringe (@RJScaringe) June 25, 2024\n\nThe Rivian founder and CEO said the industry\u2019s approach to software developed over several decades. Various electronic components to regulate everything from fuel injection to body control sprang up over time, each with its own software. This inevitably led to an increasingly tangled web of parts that struggled to function as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for an incumbent existing [automaker] is if you built a deep dependency on suppliers for making all these ECUs to flip the switch to move off of that,\u201d Scaringe said.\n\nYour typical Volkswagen car contains 50 to 70 individual electronic control units (ECUs) supplied by roughly 200 different companies. Engineers have estimated that the annual cost to integrate them in a vehicle can amount to a figure in the low hundreds of millions of euros for the brand, as something on the order of 10,000 bugs needs to be patched by the start of a new model\u2019s series production.\n\nRivian\u2019s architecture would collapse the dozens of different ECUs Volkswagen employs in most cases into a handful, minimizing the amount of wiring and cables that need to be installed while dramatically reducing complexity and cost.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI really deeply believe this is one of the hardest things for existing manufacturers to do just because of the way historically the electronics and software space has evolved within automotive,\u201d Scaringe said.\n\nVolkswagen's long-running headache with software\n\nA number of EVs like the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3 hit the market around the same time that Tesla launched the Model S in 2012, when Elon Musk\u2019s superpower was simply making the technology desirable.\n\nBut Musk really revolutionized the industry by being the first to apply software operating systems, which are well-known from smartphones, to vehicles.\n\nThis allowed Musk\u2019s company to constantly push out to the fleet new features and updates to owners over the air well after they bought a car.\n\nBy comparison, traditional automakers concentrated on building and distributing their products wholesale\u2014once a vehicle left the factory gate, the relationship with the actual end user belonged to the dealer, and there was little incentive or ability to offer improvements.\n\nIn 2015, engineers at German automakers began to recognize that they were not only years behind Tesla in adding new functions remotely via the cloud, but that software would increasingly come to define vehicles moving forward.\n\nAre layoffs at VW incoming?\n\nVolkswagen first revealed its plan to develop an\u00a0operating system of its own capable of replicating Tesla\u2019s single software stack that controls every aspect of the car late in 2017.\n\nTwo years later, the task was assigned to a newly created unit called Car Software Organization, later renamed Cariad.\n\nHowever, even as the term \"software-designed vehicles,\" or SDVs, became the new buzzword in the industry, attempts to acquire the tech sector\u2019s deep expertise in coding and its rapid iterative development approach proved halting at best.\n\nCariad\u00a0lost \u20ac4.5 billion ($4.8 billion) over the past two years and caused numerous product launch delays across the VW group.\n\nIn addition to investing up to $3 billion in Rivian equity, Volkswagen will cough up $2 billion to form a joint venture with Rivian to develop technology for such SDVs.\n\nBoth carmakers will incorporate the JVs' technology in the latter half of the decade, but Volkswagen\u2019s statement specifically references its ability to gain access to Rivian\u2019s current software platform in the short term as well.\n\nWhat this means for Cariad was not immediately spelled out.\n\nAccording to its own website, its roughly 6,500 employees worldwide work on \u201ctransforming cars into software-defined vehicles.\u201d\n\nWhen you boil it all down, they have just one job\u2014now seemingly being taken over by a new joint venture with Rivian.\n\nIn a statement to\u00a0Fortune, the company insisted the Rivian deal would complement Cariad, but UBS analysts are not so sure.\n\n\u201cThe logical consequence of the new partnership seems that VW\u2019s own software unit Cariad needs to be right-sized to avoid double-spending,\u201d analysts at the Swiss bank wrote on Wednesday.\n\nFive years after Volkswagen first began sketching out its software roadmap and billions of dollars later, it looks as if Cariad may have been a bottomless pit this whole time.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amid market uncertainty, many investors may be looking to diversify away from some of the top market winners. Instead, they want to start looking at more defensive names. Some of the biggest tech stocks have continued to rally and drive the market to new all-time highs. But, we\u2019re already seeing signs cracks are forming among certain names. And these three companies are showing some propensity for drops during times of crisis.\n\nFor those looking to position away from more cyclical tech names, consider selling these three right now. These companies could be among the biggest decliners of the large-cap tech stock group if we do see a recession. Yield curve inversions often don\u2019t end well, particularly when they persist this long.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront. Peloton layoffs\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis tech stock absolutely soared during the pandemic. However, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) went from a big winner to a major market laggard in recent years.\n\nMuch of this can be tied to market forces, as well as the company\u2019s own financial hurdles. With declining home workout demand, fierce competition, economic challenges and ongoing losses, PTON\u2019s fundamentals were hit hard. Additionally, safety recalls and leadership changes have further dampened investor confidence. The stock plummeted sharply last year and continues a downward trend this year.\n\nDuring this past earnings season, Peloton Interactive made headlines with its 20% stock surge in a week. However, despite the company\u2019s efforts, fiscal Q3 results showed persistent challenges. These include declining revenue and flat subscriber growth, along with leading Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Barry McCarthy announcement of his departure.\n\nIn May, PTON stock surged due to speculation around a potential buyout of the business. Currently valued at $1.6\u00a0 billion, Peloton Interactive is now exerting more efforts to cut costs. However, these cost cuts might cause more of a problem for investors, particularly if profitability doesn\u2019t arrive sooner than later.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is well known as the king of the electric vehicle (EV) sector. However, like many of its counterparts in this sector, it faces a myriad of challenges. Sales growth hasn\u2019t remained as robust as investors previously thought, bringing into question the company\u2019s high price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47-times.\n\nAlso, increasingly tight competition and cheaper alternatives becoming available in the market have propelled TSLA stock lower this year. In many ways, Tesla has led the price-cutting war, slashing prices to retain demand in its core consumer segments. With these price cuts have come lower margins, something that many investors focused on the bottom line clearly don\u2019t like to see.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, until interest rates are lowered and the macro environment improves, these concerns are likely to hamper the stock. Analysts tend to agree, with those at JPMorgan and Bernstein believing Tesla\u2019s disappointing Q1 reports says enough for investors to steer clear of the stock. Tesla delivered 386,810 units during the quarter, while analysts expected the company to sell 457,000 units. This underperformance makes TSLA\u2019s valuation unjustifiable, at least to me.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming platform Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been widely popular for new generations, and this stock has clearly rewarded its investors in recent years. However, Netflix now suffers tight competition from other platforms, especially now that users are not happy about the app\u2019s tightened password sharing.\n\nTo sustain growth, Netflix needs innovative strategies beyond this crackdown to expand its subscriber base and revenue. The company\u2019s P/E ratio sits at a relatively high 45-times. And with revenue slowing, this certainly poses challenges for fundamentals-oriented investors right now.\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, NFLX stock is currently a moderate buy. Considering the range of high-growth Magnificent 7 options available, will Netflix will be able to see the same capital inflows into its stock as its peers will? I think that\u2019s unlikely. And while index-related buying may help the stock during this bull market rally, how long this rally can be maintained?\n\nTherefore, Netflix is among the Magnificent 7 stocks to consider unloading right now. Better options avail with more attractive valuations and better cash flow growth projections.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "You\u2019ve Been Warned! 3 Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.",
        "content": "While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has recently faced business setbacks due to dipping demand for electric vehicles, its approach to fully self-driving cars has kept interest in its stock high. Yet, despite being the furthest ahead, Tesla isn\u2019t the only automaker focusing on the technology. Now major competitors across markets are developing their approach to becoming autonomous driving stocks, which could form a lucrative new sub-industry for investors to get in on early.\n\nFurthermore, developed nations are increasingly improving their infrastructure, making autonomous vehicles more plausible for more drivers as commutes get longer. However, investors should remember that not all technological trends in the auto industry are in demand.\n\nIn fact, despite the current media excitement around autonomous vehicles, regulations and human nature may make it so that the technology never catches on. Bearing that in mind, here are three car companies that could become autonomous driving stocks if the industry takes off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nThrough its Cadillac-branded sedans, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has shown the most promise for competing with Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving tech. The company\u2019s wide portfolio of cars has also enabled it to test various camera and autopilot technologies to determine its approach to the autonomous driving market.\n\nCurrently, General Motors\u2019 most developed self-driving technology is called Super Cruise, which is intended for long-range cruise control and exceptional comfort. The reason this technology could be more competitive than Tesla is that it\u2019s more applicable to the most common use cases when people need transport.\n\nWhile autonomous driving around the city might be nice, having a long-range cruise from point A to point B on the highway is likely more enticing to the broader population. Pair this with GM\u2019s brand identity and GM\u2019s broad market share, and it looks like one of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nNissan (NSANY) Closeup logo nissan car with soft-focus and over light in the background\n\nSource: Memory Stockphoto / Shutterstock\n\nThough Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) has struggled to capture profit growth in the last few years, the company\u2019s ProPILOT technology could be a big step in the right direction. Much like General Motors, Nissan is focusing its autonomous driving efforts on a more reasonable and generally applicable version of autonomous driving than a full Tesla autopilot.\n\nThe difference, however, is that this technology could improve Nissan\u2019s entire line of longer-range vehicles, such as SUVs and sedans, unlike Cadillac\u2019s relatively limited number of models that apply the Super Cruise technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, Nissan could potentially perform better if autonomous features continue to be more sought after in the new car market. However, investors should keep a close eye on the financial performance of Nissan before investing in its autonomous driving ventures. Once the company addresses its slimming profit margins and expenses, it could become one of the best autonomous driving stocks to invest in.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to cars and speculating on new technologies, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) tends to be one of the safest bets an investor can make. As the world\u2019s largest company by car sales, Toyota has the widest array of customers and markets to test its new Mobility Teammate Concept technologies for better integration. This makes TM a good prospect for autonomous driving stocks.\n\nThese technologies include the Chauffeur system and the Guardian system. Chauffeur technology enables a vehicle to drive on its own. while Toyota Guardian has the driver and an AI system share roles to improve driving safety. This is possible through Guardian\u2019s software, which constantly monitors the driving environment and steps in at a moment\u2019s notice to protect the vehicle and its passengers when a collision or other safety risk is imminent.\n\nMoreover, Toyota claims, \u201cThis is not done by braking alone but by using the full range of driving actions.\u201d This would put Toyota vehicle safety in a league of its own, if true.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "7 Struggling EV Stocks to Sell Before They Head to Zero",
        "content": "The electric vehicle industry has been struggling, and it is easy to argue that most EV stocks are worth selling at this point. Rate cuts are unlikely to be fast enough, barring a recession, which would be even worse for EVs. With that in mind, it makes sense to look for EV stocks to sell before the lights go out.\n\nEV startups should be the top candidates if you are looking for EV stocks to sell. These companies have been some of the worst performers in the market so far. They are perpetually diluting their shareholders and burning huge amounts of cash with only a few dozen units to show for it. And, even those units are sold at negative margins.\n\nWith that in mind, here are seven EV stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVinFast Auto (VFS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of Vietnamese car manufacturer VinFast (VFS) on screen in front of business web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is a Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer that has seen its hype train derail spectacularly over the past year. Once touted as a potential EV juggernaut, VinFast\u2019s dirt-cheap labor costs and massive addressable market in Southeast Asia had investors salivating over its export potential.\n\nHowever, the curtain has been pulled back to reveal a company hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate with no clear path to profitability. In Q1, VinFast delivered a paltry 9,689 vehicles globally, a rounding error compared to established automakers. While this represented 444% year-over-year growth, it\u2019s building from an extremely low base.\n\nManagement\u2019s full-year target of 100,000 deliveries seems like a pipe dream, considering the sluggish 2,421 quarterly run rate. VinFast\u2019s VF 5 and VF 6 models accounted for the bulk of sales.\n\nDespite management\u2019s rosy outlook, macroeconomic headwinds and fading EV exuberance will likely keep VinFast\u2019s sales stuck in neutral for the foreseeable future. I have little confidence this cash-burning machine can achieve sustainable profitability before diluting equity holders into oblivion.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) manufactures luxury electric vehicles, but I believe this EV startup is a prime example of a struggling company that investors should avoid. Saudi money is unlikely to keep it afloat forever.\n\nIn Q1, Lucid missed on both the top and bottom-lines, with EPS of -30 cents missing by 5 cents and revenue of $172.74 million missing by $9.74 million. While deliveries were up 39.9% YOY, Lucid only expects to produce about 9,000 vehicles in 2024. That\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) production.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, Lucid touts its superior technology and steadfast support from Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF. But the reality is that this company is burning cash at an alarming rate. Lucid had to raise another $1 billion just to keep the lights on this quarter, and it will need more!\n\nEven with the U.S. subsidies and tariffs currently propping up American EV companies, I don\u2019t believe Lucid can compete with Tesla in the long run. Throw in the uncertainty around the 2024 elections and potential rollback of EV subsidies, and Lucid looks like a sinking ship.\n\nFaraday Future Intelligent Electric (FFIE) Mobile phone with logo of electric vehicle company Faraday Future Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on center-right of phone display. Unmodified photo. FFIE stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFaraday Future (NASDAQ:FFIE) develops and manufactures ultra-luxury electric vehicles, but that\u2019s about the only positive thing I can say about this struggling company. The company delivered a measly 11 vehicles to date. That\u2019s not a typo. The company\u2019s flagship FF 91 2.0 costs an eye-watering $309,000, which is enough to buy nearly six Teslas with similar specs. It\u2019s hard to imagine any significant demand at those astronomical prices, especially considering the FF 91 is already outdated by several years in its capabilities.\n\nFaraday Future\u2019s financials paint an even bleaker picture. The company racked up a staggering $1.5 billion in net losses over the past three years while burning through cash at an alarming rate. As of now, Faraday has less than $2 million in cash remaining, which is barely enough to keep the lights on, let alone scale vehicle production. FFIE cash losses chart. EV stocks to sell\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nTo make matters worse, Faraday Future is caught in a vicious cycle of dilution and reverse stock splits that are rapidly eroding shareholder value. In fact, management just proposed another reverse split ranging between 1-for-2 to 1-for-40 shares. That\u2019s not the kind of financial engineering that instills confidence.\n\nGiven these immense challenges, I struggle to see how Faraday Future can avoid bankruptcy in the coming months. The company is essentially trying to sell an overpriced, outdated product to a minuscule market while hemorrhaging cash. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster in my book, placing FFIE among EV stocks to sell.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) manufactures electric and hydrogen-powered trucks. The company reported a disappointing Q1 2024, with revenue of just $7.5 million, missing estimates by a staggering $7.83 million. This 32.56% YOY decline highlights the immense challenges Nikola faces in its niche market.\n\nI believe Nikola\u2019s focus on electric and hydrogen trucks is simply too far ahead of its time. The technology isn\u2019t there yet to make these vehicles viable for most companies. Battery limitations severely hinder the practicality of electric trucks, while hydrogen infrastructure remains scarce. Nikola\u2019s venture into EV military vehicles seems even more far-fetched in the current landscape.\n\nThe company\u2019s future looks bleak, with mounting losses and dwindling cash reserves. Nikola burned through $131 million in Q1 alone. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see them file for bankruptcy protection in the coming quarters as they struggle to stay afloat.\n\nUnless EV subsidies ramp up significantly, I don\u2019t see how Nikola can compete against traditional trucks. Companies adopting Nikola\u2019s offerings would likely destroy their bottom-lines.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) builds and sells electric pickup trucks, SUVs and delivery vans. Despite growing its market share to 5.1% and becoming the fifth best-selling EV maker in the U.S. in Q1, I believe Rivian faces an uphill battle. The company posted a staggering net loss of $1.45 billion in the quarter, which is simply unsustainable. Yes, Rivian still has a sizable $7.9 billion cash buffer, but at this burn rate, bankruptcy isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\nI\u2019m skeptical about Rivian\u2019s path to profitability without significantly raising prices, which the current market won\u2019t support. And if EV subsidies get cut, Rivian\u2019s challenges will only intensify. The stock is also seeing substantial dilution, so even in a best-case scenario, shareholders might not see meaningful returns.\n\nWhile Rivian\u2019s vehicles are impressive, and the brand is gaining traction, I think the company is biting off more than it can chew.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) A close-up of an orange ChargePoint (CHPT) station.\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) provides EV charging solutions. But this stock is one to sell before it plummets to zero. The company has been hemorrhaging market share over the past few quarters as it struggles with deep unprofitability. ChargePoint\u2019s revenue in Q1 was only $107 million, a concerning 18% YOY decline. Gross margins inched up to a meager 24%, while its adjusted EBITDA loss was still an abysmal $36 million.\n\nManagement seems to be grasping at straws, touting \u201clarge deals\u201d later this year to achieve EBITDA breakeven by Q4. However, I have little faith in this pipe dream, considering ChargePoint\u2019s track record of overpromising and underdelivering. The reality is that ChargePoint is simply outmatched by bigger, more competitive players in the EV charging space. Dilution is already on the rise here. CHPT shares outstanding\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith EV adoption still in the early innings, ChargePoint will likely run out of cash and declare bankruptcy long before industry tailwinds can rescue its business model.\n\nInnoviz Technologies (INVZ) In this photo illustration the Innoviz Technologies (INVZ) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nInnoviz Technologies (NASDAQ:INVZ) makes LiDAR sensors and perception software for autonomous vehicles. I\u2019m very bullish on the LiDAR sector\u2019s long-term potential, but that doesn\u2019t mean every company is a smart bet. Innoviz is one struggling EV stock I would sell before it potentially heads to zero. The stock has plunged 64.7% in the past year as net losses hit $30.1 million in Q1 alone. With just $123.4 million in cash left, I don\u2019t believe Innoviz has the funds to survive long enough to turn profitable.\n\nWhile Innoviz scored early wins with BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and VW (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), competition is rapidly intensifying. Rivals are also launching Level 3 autonomy and aggressively pursuing the same automakers. Meanwhile, Innoviz is burning cash supporting these complex rollouts across the globe. Gross margins improved to just 17% but remain concerningly low. I view INVZ as one of the EV stocks you will want to sell now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced in its Q1 2024 report several changes to its vehicle development strategy.\n\nAmong other things, the electric carmaker said it plans to introduce new models, including more affordable options, by combining elements of its next-generation vehicle platform\u2014aimed at reducing the cost of goods sold (COGS) from around $40,000 to $20,000 per vehicle\u2014with aspects of its current platforms. These new models will be manufactured within existing production lines.\n\nTesla believes that while this approach may not achieve the maximum cost savings of an entirely new third-generation vehicle, it will improve efficiencies in capital expenditures and time to market.\n\nConsidering Tesla's tight timeframe for introducing new models and its plan to use existing manufacturing lines, Goldman Sachs analysts believe the new lower-cost models will likely incorporate design elements from the Model 3 and/or Model Y.\n\nAt Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on June 13, a slide showed current and future products, including three vehicles covered by sheets. However, those cars still gave an idea of a body shape, which analysts believe hinted at a smaller version of the Model 3, a van or larger version of the Model Y, and a robotaxi.\n\nIf Tesla can achieve roughly a quarter to a third of its original cost reduction target, it would result in an estimated $5,000 to $7,500 reduction in cost per vehicle when scaled to higher production volumes, Goldman continued.\n\n\u201cTesla Model 3 and Model Y are currently offered starting at ~$39k and ~$45k respectively in the US, and for about $32K USD and $34 USD respectively in China,\u201d analysts noted. \u201cIf Tesla were able to lower cost by a net of $5-$7.5K, it would imply a Model 3 for sub $35K in the US and sub $30K in China, and a Model Y that may start in the US for sub $40K.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla's push to cut vehicle costs may see Model 3 priced under $35k: Goldman\n\nCiti initiating coverage on US Machinery stocks\n\nPremium Catering (Holdings) Limited Files for 2M Share IPO at $4-$5/sh\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Largest Automotive Market in the World",
        "content": "We recently compiled a comprehensive report detailing the 20 Largest Automotive Markets in the World. In this article, we\u2019ll be taking a look at what's going on in the global auto industry and the largest automotive market in the world.\n\nThe Global Automotive Industry: A Brief Overview\n\nProviding millions of jobs and supporting numerous sectors, the global automotive industry plays a crucial role in the global economy. According to a report by Towards Automotive, the global automotive industry was estimated to have reached a value of $4.07 trillion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.66% from 2024 to 2032 to reach a value of $6.67 trillion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe global automotive industry has experienced significant shifts in recent years, driven by the rapid adoption of fuel-efficient cars and electric vehicles. China is heavily investing in electric vehicle (EV) production. From 2009 to 2023, the Chinese government has invested a total of $230.8 billion to support the growth and development of its electric vehicle industry, as revealed by an analysis published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nChinese electric vehicle manufacturers are emerging as significant global players, challenging automakers around the world. These Chinese companies are shaking up the competitive landscape, both within China and globally, by offering affordable and technologically advanced electric vehicles. On April 3, Bloomberg reported that Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing significant challenges in China, the largest EV market, due to intense competition from local rivals. The company\u2019s market share in China has shrunk from 10.5% in the first quarter of 2023 to around 6.7% in the fourth quarter, ending in December 2023. Chinese EV makers like BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) are offering newer models with more advanced features compared to Tesla, Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) relatively unchanged Model 3 and Model Y. BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594), in particular, has a wide range of vehicles catering to different price points. At the more affordable end, it offers the Seagull hatchback, which features a 10-inch rotating touchscreen and is priced under $10,000. On the higher end, BYD Company Limited (SHE:002594) has the Yangwang U8 plug-in hybrid SUV, which boasts an impressive 1,200 horsepower, can float on water, and can perform a 360-degree \"tank turn\".\n\nStory continues\n\nThe transition to EVs may also start gaining significant momentum in the US. On June 7, The New York Times reported that the Biden administration has unveiled new fuel efficiency standards as part of its strategy to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles in the US. The Transportation Department's regulations require American automakers to improve the average fuel economy of their passenger cars to 65 miles per gallon by 2031, up from the current 48.7 miles per gallon. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also recently introduced strict new limits on tailpipe emissions, aiming to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the US by 2032 are electric or hybrid vehicles. American automakers will be looking to increase both the number of all-electric and hybrid vehicles they sell, as well as improve the fuel efficiency of their conventional cars.\n\nA Look at General Motors Company\u2019s EV Ambitions\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company that ranks high among the world\u2019s biggest car manufacturers by revenue. The company is focused on advancing an all-electric future by leveraging its Ultium battery platform to power a diverse range of electric vehicles, from mass-market to high-performance models. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), its subsidiaries, and its joint venture entities market vehicles under the Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Baojun, and Wuling brands. GM is one of the best car stocks to buy right now.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is making significant progress in its EV business, ramping up production and improving profitability. In its Q1 2024 earnings report, the company reported that it has increased its battery module production by 300% over the past six months. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is on track to double its current EV production capacity by the end of the summer. GM's EV sales have also seen a sharp rise, with a 21% year-over-year increase in retail customer deliveries. The all-electric Cadillac LYRIQ, for instance, outsold all European luxury brand EVs in the first quarter of 2024. Since mid-March, GM has also been delivering the Chevrolet Blazer EV with updated and improved software, benefiting from the company's focus on end-to-end software improvements.\n\nLooking ahead, the Chevrolet Equinox EV is expected to arrive in showrooms in the second quarter of 2024 as the most affordable long-range EV in the US. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also plans to introduce more affordable trim levels for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Silverado EV in the second half of 2024, aiming to drive volume and market share growth. GM also aims to expand its Cadillac EV lineup with the OPTIQ and Escalade IQ later this year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2024, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and its joint ventures delivered more than 441,000 vehicles in China. This included a significant increase of 42.6% in sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), reaching a record high of more than 128,000 units. GM plans to launch a record number of NEV models in 2024 in China, leveraging a combination of global and local solutions, including new plug-in hybrid technologies, to cater to the diverse needs of consumers.

        "title": "Futures mostly higher, FedEx's rosy outlook, Rivian surges - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point mostly into the green on Wednesday after a rebound in tech stocks helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite end multi-day losing streaks in the previous session. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares spike in extended hours trading as the delivery group and global economic bellwether unveils an upbeat full-year financial forecast. Shares in Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) also surged, boosted by plans from Germany's Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to invest up to $5 billion in the electric truck maker.\n\n1. Futures broadly higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged broadly higher on Wednesday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite snapped three-day losing streaks in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:27 ET (07:27 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly flat, S&P 500 futures had gained 5 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 32 points or 0.2%.\n\nStrength in artificial intelligence semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big-name tech firms pulled both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite into the green on Tuesday. Shares in Nvidia climbed by 6.8%, recovering from a three-session sell-off, while the sector-wide Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 1.8%.\n\nChipmakers also gave lift to the S&P 500 Technology index, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also rose, pushing up the communications services index.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was the laggard, ending the trading day in the red after touching a one-month high on Monday.\n\n2. FedEx advances on upbeat outlook\n\nShares in FedEx surged by more than 13% in extended hours trading after the shipping giant revealed an upbeat outlook and unveiled plans for a $2.5 billion share buyback in its current financial year.\n\nThe Memphis-based company, whose results are considered to be a possible marker of the state of the global economy, said it now expects to deliver full-year revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digit. Analysts had called for an increase of 3%.\n\nEarnings in its 2025 fiscal period are also seen at between $20 to $22 per share, topping Wall Street's predictions of $20.92 at the midpoint.\n\nFedEx also reported a 7.2% uptick in income excluding items to $1.34 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter on revenue of $22.1 billion. CEO Raj Subramaniam called the returns \"unprecedented in this current environment,\" adding that the momentum is expected to \"continue in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nLogistics player DHL's (ETR:DHLn) stock price ticked higher in early European trading following FedEx's announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Pool shares sink\n\nPool (NASDAQ:POOL) stock fell 7% on Tuesday after the swimming pool products distributor cut its earnings and revenues expectations, citing the impact of a downturn in consumer spending on big-ticket items like home improvement projects.\n\nOne of the sector's leading names, Lousiana-based Pool flagged that construction activity may slip by 15% to 20% this year. Sales year-to-date have also decreased by around 6.5% versus the comparable period in 2023, the company noted.\n\nThe firm warned that recent data suggests \"persistently weak demand for new pool construction\" following the end of the typical swimming pool high-season from late May to early June.\n\nPool's decline on Tuesday pulled down peers like pool supplies firms Hayward Holdings (NYSE:HAYW) and Leslie's (NASDAQ:LESL), as well as pool manufacturer Latham Group (NASDAQ:SWIM).\n\n4. Rivian shares soar as VW plans $5 billion investment\n\nShares in Rivian leapt in extended hours trading after Germany's Volkswagen announced a major investment plan in the American high-end electric truck group.\n\nThe partnership, which could see VW provide Rivian with as much as $5 billion in capital, aims to form a 50/50 joint venture for sharing knowledge on electric vehicle architecture and software. If the tie-up is completed, Volkswagen will gain \"immediate access\" to Rivian's current EV technology.\n\nA final decision on the establishment of the joint venture is still pending.\n\nThe move comes as VW looks to bolster its EV offerings during a time of intensifying competition from rivals in China and U.S. giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n5. Crude inches up\n\nCrude prices rose Wednesday, despite a surprise jump in U.S. stockpiles, as traders weighed geopolitical risks and confidence surrounding the summer driving season.\n\nBy 03:26 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.6% higher at $81.28 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.5% to $84.62 a barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories grew by around 0.9 million barrels in the week to June 21.\n\nThis was something of a surprise given expectations for a draw of 3 million barrels, but is largely being overlooked as investors anticipate inventory drawdowns during the peak third quarter demand season. The official numbers from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.\n\nBoth contracts are still sitting on strong gains over the past two weeks, as persistent geopolitical tensions \u2013 Israeli strikes on Gaza and Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries -- resulted in traders pricing a risk premium into oil prices.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures mostly higher, FedEx's rosy outlook, Rivian surges - what's moving markets\n\nVolkswagen's $5 billion investment in Rivian boosts EV maker's shares\n\nBarclays: FOMO fever leaves positioning full, vulnerable to Tech faltering\n\nView comments",

BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show \u2018Hot Ones\u2019 Paul Singer Is Pitching Wall Street's Own Brand of MAGA\n\nVW said in a release that it will invest $1 billion immediately in Rivian and an additional $4 billion over time. The new venture will be \u201cequally controlled and owned\u201d and aims to develop \u201cnext generation\u201d battery-powered vehicles and software, VW and Rivian said in a joint statement.\n\nRivian\u2019s shares surged following the announcement, gaining more than 50% in aftermarket trading. The stock had fallen 49% this year through Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\nThe strategic tie-up provides Rivian with a much-needed source of fresh capital after the company has struggled to ramp up production and deliveries of its electric pickup and SUV models. It comes ahead of Rivian\u2019s previously-scheduled investor day on Thursday.\n\nVolkswagen plans to take an initial $1 billion equity stake in Rivian through an unsecured convertible note that will exchange into Rivian shares on or after Dec. 1, according to the statement. Amazon.com Inc. is Rivian\u2019s largest shareholder with a 16% stake valued at nearly $2 billion as of Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\nThe pact then calls for VW to invest an additional $2 billion in Rivian shares via two equal tranches in 2025 and 2026. The German automaker also intends to put $2 billion into the joint venture through a payment at the venture\u2019s inception and a loan available in 2026, according to the statement.\n\nOn a conference call, Rivian Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said he and VW CEO Oliver Blume, shared an \u201cimmediate realization\u201d the two were aligned on product strategy soon after they initially met. That led to conversations about working together, he said.\n\n\u201cThrough our cooperation, we will bring the best solutions to our vehicles faster and at lower cost,\u201d Blume said in the companies\u2019 statement. \u201cWe are strengthening our technology profile and our competitiveness.\u201d\n\nRivian went public in November 2021 at the peak of enthusiasm for the speedy arrival of the EV future, seen as a potentially formidable competitor to EV market leader Tesla Inc. An early rise in Rivian shares briefly gave it a market value exceeding that of Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince then, many of its fellow EV startups have fallen by the wayside as mainstream car buyers turned away from pricey EVs. Rivian has struggled to find a path to profitability and generate enough cash flow to fund its future.\n\nRivian has seen attempted partnerships with established automakers collapse before. In November 2021, it abandoned plans to jointly develop EVs with Ford Motor Co., an early investor. And in December 2022, it shelved a deal to build electric vans with Mercedes-Benz AG.\n\nFor VW, the German automotive giant gets access to the EV startup\u2019s software and EV architecture after years struggling to roll out plug-in vehicles with efficiency and functionality on par with those from Tesla Inc.\n\nBoth companies plan to introduce vehicles featuring technology created by the joint venture in the second half of this decade, according to the companies\u2019 joint statement.\n\n(Updates with shares, details from announcement from fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Why BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash Independence Without Accountability: The Fed\u2019s Great Inflation Fail How to Do Succession the Right Way\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The trade in technology stocks is growing volatile. The shares of microchip and semiconductor companies, which had led the market higher in this year\u2019s first half, are selling off as we near the end of June. At the same time, several other well-known technology stocks are in the red this year.\n\nWhether due to disappointing earnings, competitive threats or being viewed as overvalued and expensive, several tech stocks are down right now and missing out on the bull run in equities. Shrewd investors will see the current situation as a buying opportunity and capitalize on it. Here are three tech stocks to buy on the dip: June 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors hoping to take a position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, now\u2019s your chance. On the day of this writing, NVDA stock is down 6%, bringing its five day decline to 10%. After splitting on a 10-for-1 basis on June 10, Nvidia stock quickly rose to an all-time high and briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company before selling off to end the year\u2019s first half.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut don\u2019t expect NVDA stock to be down for long. Analysts say the current drop in the company\u2019s share price is due to profit taking and the expiry of options contracts at the end of the second quarter. Notably, Nvidia faces a rare \u201ctriple witching\u201d options contract expiration. This is when options contracts tied to an individual stock, index and exchange-traded fund (ETF) expire at the same time, typically at the end of a quarter. Nothing has fundamentally changed with Nvidia stock or the company\u2019s growth story.\n\nYear-to-date, NVDA stock is still up 150% and its shares have nearly tripled in the last 12 months.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d there might be a buying opportunity in Tesla\u2019s shares (NASDAQ:TSLA). Of course, taking a position in the electric vehicle maker is not without risk, and the share price will likely remain volatile for the foreseeable future. However, for investors with strong stomachs and a long time horizon, TSLA stock looks like a buy-the-dip candidate.\n\nSo far in 2024, TSLA stock is down 26%. The drop comes amid slowing sales of its electric vehicles and gloomy forward guidance from management. However, the company\u2019s share price has been up more than 1,100% over the past five years, illustrating the opportunity for investors. Tesla is in transition right now as it focuses on new pursuits that include supercomputers and humanoid robots. Again, it is not for everyone, but it is a potential tech stock to buy on the dip.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nThe sell-off in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock looks a little overdone after the company\u2019s most recent financial results. Sure, the company behind creative software products such as Illustrator and Photoshop still faces a threat from artificial intelligence (AI), but it\u2019s responding. ADBE stock recently popped 15% higher after the design software company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nHowever, even with the jump in post-earnings, Adobe\u2019s stock has remained down nearly 10% this year and has largely missed the current market rally. That said, Adobe\u2019s first-quarter EPS of $4.48 was better than the $4.39 expected among analysts. Sales of $5.31 billion beat estimates of $5.29 billion and were up 10% from a year earlier. Management said they continue adding AI to their suite of creative software products, notably Firefly.\n\nWhile not out of the woods, ADBE stock is trending in the right direction and more gains can be expected, making Adobe a tech stock to buy on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "We finally know how many Cybertrucks Tesla has sold so far",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) announced another recall for its Cybertruck \u2014 its fourth since its release late last year. But perhaps the real headline from the announcement? Within the recall notice, there's a disclosure on how many Cybertrucks are actually out in the wild.\n\nIn a letter from NHTSA dated Monday, June 24, Tesla confirmed that it would be issuing a recall for a defective front wiper. The Cybertruck's single large front wiper (the largest ever used for a passenger vehicle) can fail due to \u201cexcessive electrical current.\u201d A separate concurrent recall was also issued for the trim panel in the truck\u2019s bed.\n\nTesla also revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall \u2014 11,688 trucks \u2014 which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold in the US since sales began. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nDigging through the numbers also reveals estimated monthly delivery figures. Tesla began low-volume production of the Cybertruck at Giga Austin in late November of last year, and a prior recall notice from Tesla revealed that it delivered 1,163 vehicles in December. That leaves 10,525 vehicles or thereabouts produced by Tesla in 2024, giving Tesla an average monthly delivery rate of 1,754 Cybertrucks, with five days left in June. The secret sales figures are out: a Tesla Cybertruck in Queens, New York. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (UCG via Getty Images)\n\nExtrapolating that through the end of 2024 means Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nProducing 2,500 Cybertrucks a week equates to a theoretical 125,000 vehicles a year (with two weeks of factory downtime), or half the total Tesla sees as its full-volume production total of 250,000 units.\n\nThe bigger question here is whether there are enough Cybertruck buyers for 125,000 vehicles produced in a year, let alone 250,000 vehicles. Musk claimed last year that Cybertruck demand was \u201coff the hook\u201d and also revealed at the shareholder meeting that cheaper, non-Foundation series Cybertrucks are on the way. The Foundation Series starts at $102,235, but cheaper trims like the Cyberbeast ($96,390) and All-Wheel Drive ($76,390) could be on the way. Bullish? Elon Musk at Tesla's 2024 Shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas. (Tesla YouTube stream) (Tesla YouTube stream)\n\nThe overall demand picture for EVs \u2014 even Tesla EVs like the popular Model Y SUV \u2014 is murky. Musk confirmed at the shareholder meeting that near-term demand and sales will still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Musk said with regard to the EV market, adding that competitors have also been pulling back EV investment and production.\n\nTesla is expected to report overall second quarter delivery numbers early next week. The Street is expecting around 441K deliveries for the quarter per Bloomberg consensus, which would be higher than the 386.8K delivered in Q1 but lower than the 466.1K delivered a year ago.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

Stifel's confidence in Tesla stems from its robust technology portfolio, global manufacturing footprint, and strong profitability.\n\nThe brokerage firm also pointed out Tesla's vast global supply chain and internal manufacturing as factors supporting cost advantages and margins.\n\nThe Supercharger network was also mentioned as a key element driving brand loyalty, sales, and profitability for Tesla.\n\nStifel believes that Tesla's pure AI-based FSD technology could generate significant value. This includes sales of the FSD software, possible licensing agreements, and its critical role in the development of RoboTaxi initiatives in the longer term.\n\nMoreover, Tesla's energy generation and storage business is seen as a potentially significant growth driver.\n\nDespite acknowledging near-term risks such as the lackluster first-quarter results in 2024 and potential headwinds in EV adoption, as well as uncertainties surrounding the U.S. election, Stifel suggests that recent downward estimate revisions for Tesla's stock are likely finished, which could remove an overhang on shares of the EV maker.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStifel initiates Tesla stock with a Buy rating, sees 45% upside potential\n\nReddit to update web standard to block automated website scraping\n\nNasdaq ends higher on tech strength; Dow pulls back\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Upcoming Stock Splits to Add to Your 2024 Calendars Right Now",
        "content": "Trends come and go, but one in fashion again is stock splits. Two years ago, there was a frenzy of splits in the tech space. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) all split their stock. But then the phenomenon died down last year. Now, it seems to be rebounding \u2014 with a twist.\n\nWhile tech stocks are still splitting their shares (Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently split its shares 10-to-1), a lot of the upcoming stock splits are among more consumer discretionary stocks. It began earlier this year when Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its shares 3-to-1. Uniform provider Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) will split its stock by a similar ratio in September and Sony (NYSE:SONY) will follow suit with a 5-for-1 split later this fall.\n\nThere are three more upcoming stock splits investors will want to keep an eye on, including one happening after the stock market closes today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough splits change nothing about a company, they offer positive signals about a company, and investors seem to like them. So, let\u2019s see if the three upcoming stock splits below are worth buying now at the higher price or if you should wait til they are more accessible.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first upcoming stock split is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Currently trading over $3,200, the Mexican food chain\u2019s stock will split by a whopping 50-to-1 after the closing bell today. Afterward, they will go for a more reasonable $64 a stub.\n\nChipotle is on a tear. Although shares slid 6% the other day, the restaurateur is still up 41% year-to-date and 57% over the past year. The stock has more than doubled over the past three years because business is booming.\n\nSales jumped 14% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion on a 7% jump in comparable restaurant sales. Operating margins widened 80 basis points (bp) to 16.3% from last year while restaurant-level margins expanded to 27.5% from 25.6% \u2014 a 190 bp gain.\n\nWall Street believes profits will keep flowing Chipotle\u2019s way. Analysts forecast earnings will grow long-term at a compounded annual rate of 22% as the restaurant chain is seen as a good exchange for value. At this point, you may as well wait for the split to take effect tomorrow to add it to your portfolio.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn just about two weeks, kitchen wares giant Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) will split its shares 2-for-1. The upcoming July 9 split will take WSM stock from just over $300 a share down to around $150 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn announcing the halving event two weeks ago, the kitchen wares stock said the purpose is to make its stock more accessible to investors and employees. It is notable, though, that Williams-Sonoma stock has not really gone anywhere since it peaked at the end of March and the beginning of April. It actually trades 3% lower than it did three months ago, and even the split announcement did little to rally the stock.\n\nAlthough the company typically caters to a more upscale customer, which normally shields a business from the worst effects of inflation and high interest rates, the retailer is having trouble gaining traction. It had to reach out to more middle-income consumers who are feeling the pinch more.\n\nSales were down 5% in the first quarter on a similar percentage decline in comparable brand revenue. Over a two-year period, the comp is down 11% and off 1.4% over three years.\n\nDespite trading in the low triple digits, there doesn\u2019t appear much need for Williams-Sonoma to split its stock. And until its business shows the kind of traction signaling long-term growth, I wouldn\u2019t be a buyer before or after.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have a little more time to think about Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which isn\u2019t set to split its stock until July 15. Currently trading at around $1,600 per share, the 10-for-1 upcoming stock split will put shares at a more attainable $160 each.\n\nIn March, I had anticipated the mobile device chip maker would announce an upcoming stock split even as it was trading about 16% lower than it is now. I noted at the time that \u201cBroadcom\u2019s network and server solutions for data centers are optimized for artificial intelligence (AI). That blends well with the AI chips it is developing as well. AI is a fast-growing business and generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the company last quarter.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Broadcom shifted its focus from mobile chipsets to data center infrastructure. It began building custom accelerators and is finding demand among hyperscalers growing.\u00a0In a bid to make its wares available to the widest possible customer base, the chipmaker is concentrating on the lowest power accelerators based on open standards.\n\nThere is no limit to its growth potential at the moment as it heads towards a trillion-dollar valuation. An investor could buy AVGO stock before or after the split and do well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "A small group of tech stocks is driving the market rally \u2014 why that's 'not a flaw'",
        "content": "This year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names.\n\nWhile it might seem concerning to have too much riding on a handful of stocks, strategists say the trend may not be a bad thing for markets.\n\n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme \u2014 not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\n\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\n\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\n\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\n\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his target to 6,000 from 4,750, citing the \"early innings of AI\" and a market supported by the \"persistence of AI exuberance.\" Citi's Scott Chronert bumped his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 noting \"the weighting effect of the mega cap growth cohort is exerting an outsized influence on index price action.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200, highlighting that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs laid out an alternative scenario to their base case call for 5,600 on the S&P 500, where the benchmark skyrockets to 6,300 by the end of the year. This, Goldman's team wrote, would be driven by \"further mega-cap exceptionalism.\"\n\nSnider told Yahoo Finance this possibility would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\" Snider added that such a scenario leaves investors \"vulnerable\" to a few stocks beating expectations. But it still comes with an upside.\n\n\"The beauty of the S&P 500 index ownership in general, which is when a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now. So I think most investors who own the S&P 500 are very happy with what's happened, even if it means their underlying portfolios are more concentrated,\" Snider said.

        "content": "BEIJING/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has accelerated its selling of shares in BYD, China's largest seller of electric vehicles.\n\nBerkshire reduced its stake in BYD's issued H-shares to 5.99% on June 19, according to a Tuesday filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange. The stake had been 7.02% as recently as June 11.\n\nHong Kong requires larger shareholders to disclose sales when their resulting stakes fall below whole percentage numbers. Berkshire may cease disclosing BYD sales after its ownership stake falls below 5%.\n\nBuffett's company began investing in Shenzhen-based BYD in 2008, when it paid $230 million for about 225 million shares, then equal to a 10% stake.\n\nIt began disclosing sales in August 2022, after BYD's share price had risen more than 20-fold, and two months after it set a record high. The price has since fallen about 28%.\n\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, spearheaded the BYD investment, and Buffett has given him full credit. Berkshire invests mainly in the United States.\n\nFounded by Chinese chemist Wang Chuanfu in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries, BYD surpassed fellow billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla last year as the world's largest electric vehicle maker. Tesla regained the top spot in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire ended March with $189 billion of U.S. Treasury bills, cash and equivalents after selling $20 billion of stock, mainly Apple, in the first quarter.\n\nThe cash stake included $182.3 billion outside Berkshire's railroad, utilities and energy businesses. At Berkshire's annual meeting on May 4. Buffett called it a \"fair assumption\" that this amount could grow to $200 billion this quarter.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang is beginning to learn the meaning of the expression \u201cthe higher they rise, the harder the fall\u201d.\n\nAfter briefly eclipsing Microsoft and Apple in value last week\u2014and indeed entire European stock markets\u2014the company behind the AI chip boom has experienced the single fastest drawdown in history.\n\nOver the past three days, roughly $430 billion in Nvidia's market cap has been wiped out, which is the biggest three-day value loss for any company in history. If you measure the drop from its intraday peak on Thursday, more than half a trillion dollars have gone up in smoke. That\u2019s almost the entire value of Tesla knocked off its shares, which pose larger problems for the overall stock market.\n\n\u201cIf Nvidia corrects pretty hard in the coming months it becomes very difficult for the [S&P 500] to keep rising,\u201d Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel Financial Corp., told the Financial Times.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t helped either that the founder and CEO has inadvertently added to the pressure by cashing out himself. Huang\u2019s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which automatically executes sales when certain conditions are met, liquidated 720,000 shares worth nearly $95 million this month alone.\n\nThe timing is unfortunate coming just before Wednesday\u2019s annual shareholder meeting and two weeks after 10-for-1 stock split that made it easier for retail investors to buy into the company. One indication many amateur traders might be taking profits in Nvidia is a sudden slump in Bitcoin, an asset highly correlated to the retail market since it is largely untouched by institutional investors.\n\nSpeaking with Yahoo Finance, Harvest Portfolio Management co-CIO Paul Meeks blamed the drop on profit taking and talk of AI data center spending peaking.\n\n\u201cThe key here is to make investors feel comfortable that there is a long runway yet,\u201d he\u00a0told the program on Monday.\n\nFirst @NVIDIA DGX H200 in the world, hand-delivered to OpenAI and dedicated by Jensen \"to advance AI, computing, and humanity\": pic.twitter.com/rEJu7OTNGT\n\n\u2014 Greg Brockman (@gdb) April 24, 2024\n\nWhile Meeks argued Nvidia still looked cheap compared with Cisco when it surged during the dotcom era on the back of internet infrastructure spending, Nvidia\u2019s stock chart suggested further pressure until the price settled around a support line like the 50-day moving average.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSo [I\u2019m] comfortable with the fundamentals, not comfortable with the technicals,\u201d he said, adding he once the heavy selling volumes begin petering out, he\u2019s \u201cinclined to go back in\u201d and add to his large position in the share.\n\nThe company has not responded to a request by Fortune for comment.\n\nUndisputed leader with Elon Musk and OpenAI as key customers\n\nNvidia\u2019s bleeding-edge H100 chips are specially designed for data centers that train neural networks, including the large language models like GPT-4 and other forms of generative AI. One of its most prolific buyers is Elon Musk, who is ordering more chips than he claims his company Tesla can even install just to ensure he gets his hands on them faster than any of his tech competitors.\n\nIts best known customer however remains OpenAI, whose ChatGPT creation in November 2022 launched the GenAI gold rush. In April Huang took the rare step of hand delivering a personally signed DGX server to the company, one that came equipped with the first H200 training chips offering nearly twice the GPU memory of its predecessor.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position as the undisputed global leader\u2014whose AI training chips are a matter\u00a0of U.S. national security\u2014has spawned a rally in its stock price that can only be compared with Tesla\u2019s 2020 pile-on.\n\nOn Monday, Deutsche Bank illustrated the historic nature of Nvidia\u2019s surge by publishing a chart that compared its market cap to Warren Buffett\u2019s investment holding. \u201cBerkshire Hathaway has taken over a century to go from zero to just under $1 trillion,\u201d it wrote. \u201cIt took 30 days for Nvidia to go from $2 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap.\u201d\n\nPart of this insane volatility stems from the challenge of properly valuing the trajectory of future revenue, earnings and cashflow when the company\u2019s fundamentals are all improving at a speed\u00a0no one had anticipated, Nvidia included.\n\nFor now, the share is expected to see a rebound when trading on Tuesday opens, but more short-term pain could in store for Nvidia bulls as Meeks suggested. Another adage well known on Wall Street is \u201cthe trend is your friend\u201d.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla Makes Money Selling Electric Vehicles, But 86% of Its Earnings Might Soon Come From This Instead",
        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) sales account for more than 81% of Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) total revenue at the moment. The company could sell more than 2 million units this year, making it one of the largest EV manufacturers in the world.\n\nBut technology investor Cathie Wood thinks artificial intelligence (AI) -- not EV sales -- is the best reason to own Tesla stock. The company is using AI to develop its autonomous full self-driving (FSD) software, which has already completed billions of real-world miles in beta mode.\n\nWood's firm, Ark Investment Management, just released a fresh set of financial models suggesting that EV sales won't be the driving force behind Tesla's success for much longer. With the help of AI, Ark predicts 86% of the company's earnings will come from something else entirely. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTesla needs to expand beyond the passenger EV business\n\nDoubters were lining up around the block when Tesla stock came public in 2010. Few investors believed its ambitious CEO, Elon Musk, could successfully design, build, and sell EVs. But he proved them wrong, and Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling car globally in 2023 across all categories.\n\nBut Tesla's core EV business is slowing down due to softening demand and growing competition. The company delivered just 386,810 cars in the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), marking a decline of 9% from the year-ago period. Musk hasn't offered a sales forecast for the 2024 full year, but some analysts think the company will deliver 2.2 million units. This will represent growth of just 22% -- far below Musk's target of growing 50% annually for the foreseeable future.\n\nTesla had to slash prices by 25.1% throughout 2023 to support demand, and EV prices declined by a further 9% across the industry in the first three months of 2024.\n\nPricing pressure will only worsen due to the increasingly competitive landscape. Most western manufacturers will struggle to match the production costs of China-based BYD, for example, which just launched an entry-level EV with a price tag of $9,700. In response, Tesla recently unveiled plans to release an entry-level model of its own in 2025, which could start at $25,000.\n\nBut selling cars at that price point will squeeze Tesla's profit margins, so the best path forward is to build other businesses to complement its EVs.\n\nEnter the robotaxi and FSD software\n\nTesla is gearing up to unveil its robotaxi in August. This is a fully autonomous car designed specifically for ride-hailing (think Uber (NYSE: UBER), except without the human driver). However, its success depends entirely on the widespread release of the company's FSD software.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk says customers have driven over 300 billion miles with the latest version 12 of FSD software. But it remains in beta mode, which means the human driver must stand ready to take the wheel. However, Ark thinks FSD could eventually win regulatory approval, partly based on its safety record so far.\n\nAccording to data published by Ark, Teslas in FSD mode crash once per 3,200 miles (on average), compared to the U.S. national average of one crash per 192 miles. In other words, an autonomous Tesla might be 16 times safer than your typical American driver.\n\nFSD could transform Tesla's economics\n\nMusk wants to create a ride-hailing network within Tesla, where the company can deploy robotaxis around the clock to generate revenue. Uber spent $16.6 billion paying its human drivers in the recent quarter alone (its single largest expense), so if Tesla can eliminate that cost, its ride-hailing service will come with a very high profit margin.\n\nBut Tesla will also sell FSD software on a subscription basis to owners of its EVs, and Musk has floated the idea of licensing it to other car manufacturers too. Software-as-a-service often comes with high gross profit margins -- sometimes as high as 80% -- so this could be a game-changer for Tesla's bottom line, especially as the EV price war heats up.\n\nArk thinks Tesla will generate $1.2 trillion in revenue in 2029, with 63% coming from the robotaxi business alone. EV sales will drop to just 26% of the company's total revenue, compared to 81% today.\n\nThat shift could supercharge Tesla's profitability, resulting in $440 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2029, according to Ark's models. A whopping 86% of that is expected to come from the robotaxi segment.\n\nArk's models are very ambitious\n\nWall Street estimates that Tesla will generate $98.4 billion in revenue in 2024. To reach Ark's forecast of $1.2 trillion in annual revenue by 2029, the company will have to grow by 64.9% every year (on average) between now and then.\n\nRemember, Musk himself wants to see Tesla growing by just 50% per year over the long term, and it's underperforming that target significantly at the moment. Ark's models appear to be very ambitious from that perspective.\n\nPlus, Uber has 149 million monthly active users on its platform, and they have booked $72.5 billion worth of rides over the last four quarters. So, even if Tesla overtakes Uber to become the world's largest ride-hailing service, that $72.5 billion in annual bookings won't go a very long way toward boosting its revenue to $1.2 trillion.\n\nSimply put, I don't think Ark's models will reflect reality in 2029. Keep in mind that neither the robotaxi nor FSD software have actually been approved by regulators yet. Even if they do win approval, there is no telling whether people will actually adopt them in the volumes required to meet Ark's financial predictions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Uber (NYSE:UBER): Long-Term Growth Story Continues Despite Robotaxi Fears",
        "content": "Uber (NYSE:UBER), the leading ridesharing company, has demonstrated strong performance throughout the past 12 months despite experiencing setbacks in Q1 that caused its stock to lose some ground. Looking ahead in the long term, the growth trajectory in both the bottom and top lines seems robust. This is despite the potential threat posed by the transition to autonomous vehicles (AVs) to the company\u2019s business model. Therefore, I currently maintain a cautiously bullish stance on Uber.\n\nWhy UBER Is Down Since Its All-Time Highs\n\nSince reaching its all-time high peak in mid-February this year, Uber\u2019s stock has underperformed and specific reasons for this became clearer following the Q1 results released in May.\n\nFirst, there has been a significant shift in the composition of Uber\u2019s core business. In Q1 2020, the Mobility segment (rides) contributed to around 70% of Uber\u2019s revenues.\u00a0Today, however,\u00a0this figure has decreased to 56%,\u00a0largely\u00a0because Uber has expanded its presence in Deliveries (Uber Eats), which\u00a0has become a major\u00a0part of its business in recent years.\n\nComparing gross bookings in Q1 2024 to the same period last year, there was an overall increase of 20%.\u00a0Within specific segments, the Mobility segment grew\u00a0by\u00a030% year-over-year in Q1 2024, down from 39%\u00a0growth\u00a0in Q1 2023.\u00a0In contrast, Delivery gross bookings increased by 18% year-over-year in Q1 2024, up from 8% growth in Q1 2023.\n\nI believe that the\u00a0market has reacted negatively because Uber\u2019s growth is slowing down due to its shift away from Mobility, its traditional core business that historically played a crucial role in its growth and valuation.\n\nAnother factor impacting Uber\u2019s bottom line in Q1, leading to a loss of $654 million, was a non-recurring event.\u00a0Uber reported a $721 million charge related to equity investments in other companies, such as DiDi (OTC:DIDIY). As the value of these investments dropped, Uber had to account for this decrease in value on its financial statements. While addressing these issues was the right move for transparency, it certainly delivered a one-punch hit to the stock price.\n\nWill Autonomous Driving Hurt or Help UBER?\n\nAnother factor that may\u00a0be affecting\u00a0the company\u2019s stock in the near term is the buzz surrounding Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) robotaxi strategy. Tesla\u2019s plan to own and operate a fleet of robotaxis has sparked discussions about the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on Uber\u2019s business model.\n\nWhile this could potentially shape the future landscape of ridesharing, if Uber moves towards adopting this disruptive technology, several assumptions can be made.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber\u2019s transition to autonomous vehicles presents financial challenges due to the upfront costs of acquiring and maintaining an AV fleet. Currently, Uber\u2019s drivers bear these costs themselves. However, if Uber shifts to AVs, it\u00a0would need to invest in purchasing or leasing these vehicles, which could be expensive initially.\n\nDespite these initial costs, this transition would involve Uber deploying AVs as robotaxis, maximizing fleet utilization and operational efficiency. AVs could operate almost continuously, unlike traditional vehicles that often sit idle.\n\nAt any rate,\u00a0according to\u00a0Uber\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, the company is well-positioned to navigate and thrive through the transition to autonomous vehicles.\u00a0He also mentioned that Tesla\u2019s robotaxi project will require tools that Uber already possesses to make financial sense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be all Robotaxi anytime soon, and we think\u00a0that\u00a0when the technology comes in, there will be a transition.\u00a0You will have essentially hybrid networks.\u00a0And going through that transition, we think we\u2019re uniquely situated as a marketplace to assess and have\u00a0any and all\u00a0safe AV tech along with\u00a0human drivers on our network.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Uber sold its autonomous vehicle unit to Aurora four years ago but continues its partnership. This smart move, in my view, should help Uber reduce operating costs while leveraging technology at scale.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for Uber?\n\nPeering into Uber\u2019s future, while forecasting the impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) remains challenging, other factors are more predictable at this time, which I perceive as significant long-term risks.\n\nOne\u00a0major\u00a0concern is growing regulatory pressures. Despite being familiar with regulatory challenges, Uber\u2019s size and market dominance make it a prime target for regulators. Legal battles and regulatory actions could potentially\u00a0weigh on the company\u2019s future profitability.\n\nHowever, I believe Uber\u2019s key segments\u2019 growth potential should remain robust for at least the next couple of years.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Uber is expected to see growth in both its bottom and top lines throughout 2024. Revenue is projected to grow by 15.8%, while EPS is expected to increase by 2%. This results in a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 79x. Looking further ahead to the end of 2025, forecasts suggest a substantial 137.5% growth in profits, potentially yielding EPS of $2.11, alongside a 15% increase in revenues. This would reduce the forward P/E ratio to 33x, making Uber\u2019s valuation much more compelling.\n\nIs UBER Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus among Wall Street analysts regarding UBER is a Strong Buy. This is based on 29 Buys and one Hold rating assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average UBER stock price target among 30 analysts is $87.86, implying upside potential of 24.6%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile Uber faces challenges such as regulatory scrutiny and potential competition from autonomous vehicles threatening its business model, I believe that the company\u2019s revenue composition shift towards delivery services could prove beneficial in mitigating this risk.\n\nUber\u2019s revenue and net income growth prospects in the medium-to-long term also appear promising, driven by anticipated improvements in profitability and financial metrics.\n\nAlthough Uber is not currently considered a low-cost stock, I\u00a0do not\u00a0perceive it as\u00a0expensive\u00a0relative to its growth profile. Therefore, I remain cautiously optimistic about Uber\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 EV Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "In June 2010, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had a market valuation of $2.2 billion. Currently, the electric vehicle company commands a valuation of $583 billion. Clearly, massive wealth has been created by one of the leading EV companies in the world.\n\nHaving said that, EV stocks have been depressed in the last 12 to 18 months. The reasons include macroeconomic headwinds, intense competition and slower-than-expected EV adoption. These factors have translated into some of the best EV stocks trading at undervalued levels. In my view, the pessimism is the best time to consider EV stocks for long-term growth.\n\nThis column focuses on three EV companies that are likely to navigate current challenges and emerge stronger. These EV stocks represent companies that are focused on innovation to drive growth. Once headwinds wane, these EV stocks will be back to wealth creation mode.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these EV stories.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor investors bullish on the long-term growth for the EV industry, Tesla is a must hold in the portfolio. Over the years, Tesla has proved sceptics wrong through innovation and products that capture consumer interest. I expect the EV major to remain among the top three EV players globally by the end of the decade.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Tesla has always surprised investors and competitors. As an example, the company\u2019s \u201cgigacasting\u201d process has reduced production cost. Further, the company is close to \u201can innovation that would allow it to die cast nearly all the complex underbody of an EV in one piece.\u201d The unboxed manufacturing process will reduce manufacturing cost significantly. This is critical at a time when intense competition has negatively impacted margins.\n\nIn terms of deliveries growth, there are two points to note. First, the launch of new models will support deliveries upside. A potential low-cost car is likely to be a game-changer considering the brand pull. Further, Tesla is yet to make inroads into some high-growth markets like Indonesia and India, among others. These markets can be significant growth drivers in the next decade.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nBYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) stock has been largely sideways in the last 12 months. Even with the recent tariff by the European Union on Chinese EVs, BYDFF stock has remained resilient. This is an indication of undervaluation. With bearish sentiments, it\u2019s the best time to buy the stock.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in Q4 2023, BYD overtook Tesla in terms of the number of cars sold. It\u2019s likely to be a neck-to-neck fight for the top spot in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the flip-side BYD reported revenue growth at a four-year low in Q1 2024. At the same time, margin compression was on the back of pricing wars. Further, as competition intensifies, investment in R&D has to be higher to maintain the competitive edge.\n\nTo boost growth, BYD has increased focus on emerging markets. The EV firm is building facilities in Thailand and Brazil. Further, expansion is in the cards in Indonesia, Hungary and Uzbekistan as well. The EV company\u2019s car sales in India have also been gaining momentum. New markets will therefore support deliveries growth and revenue upside.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFF) a Panasonic TV\n\nSource: Panasonic\n\nA steady uptick in demand for EVs would also imply growth for EV battery companies. Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFF) is an attractive EV battery maker to consider at undervalued levels. It\u2019s worth noting that PCRFF stock trades at a forward P/E of 6.5 and offers a dividend yield of 2.83%. As an innovator and a leading EV battery maker, the stock is a steal at current levels.\n\nAn important point to note is that Panasonic has ambitious growth plans. At the beginning of 2024, the battery maker had a capacity of 50Gwh. The target is to quadruple capacity to 200Gwh by March 2031. This is likely to translate into sustained revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nOn the innovation front, Panasonic is targeting the roll out the newest iteration of its EV battery cells with improved capacity as early as this year. The long-term target is to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density from current levels. This will help in improving productivity and lowering the overall cost of an EV. With these positives, PCRFF stock is poised to deliver multibagger returns in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Beyond Tesla, Bet on Elon Musk With These Stocks &amp; ETFs",
        "content": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla TSLA, is an enormously famous name in the business world, mainly due to his visionary goals and disruptive approaches to technology. He has made meaningful contributions to multiple industries.\n\nBesides being the CEO of Tesla, he is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, which has reshaped the space industry by developing reusable rockets, cutting the cost of space travel. Musk co-founded SolarCity \u2014 an important provider of solar energy services in the United States. It was later acquired by Tesla.\n\nInvestors should note that there are pure-play space ETFs called ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF ARKX and Procure Space ETF UFO. Although these ETFs have displayed subdued performance this year, the products can turn around once the space industry matures (read: $1.8T Space Boom Expected by 2035: ETFs to Play).\n\nMusk's company Neuralink is into developing brain-machine interface technology, looking to establish a direct connection between the human brain and computers, which could transform medical treatments and human cognition.\n\nElon Musk is known for his active presence on X, formerly known as Twitter. In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter, where he implemented several noteworthy changes. Musk intends to change the micro-blogging website to a larger concept called \"X,\" an \"everything app\" that could comprise various functionalities such as messaging, social media, payments and more.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Musk's influence continues to impact market perceptions. While Tesla is down 26% this year mainly due to profitability issues, stiff competition and an overall slowdown in the electric vehicle space, there are other forms available in the market that help investors to bet big on Elon Musk\u2019s Vision. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nMusk on Artificial Intelligence\n\nLately, Musk has been looking to play all out in promoting artificial intelligence (AI). Tesla uses AI for its autonomous driving technology. Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI, which is famous for its Gen AI form \u2013 ChatGPT. Musk has announced a $10 billion investment in AI for Tesla this year, focusing on projects like the fully autonomous Robotaxi fleet.\n\nOne of his important ventures is the AI startup xAI, which recently amassed $6 billion in Series B funding. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest is among the key investors, contributing $60 million to xAI. This investment indicates a strong confidence in xAI's potential, especially given its access to real-time data from other Musk-led companies like X.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this regard, investors can play Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF CHAT (up 23.6% this year).\n\nMusk's Impact on SMCI and DELL\n\nWhile Tesla is Musk\u2019s sole public company, investors can indirectly access his ventures through suppliers like Super Micro Computer SMCI. This strategy exposes investors to the broader AI ecosystem, benefiting hardware manufacturers and related tech holdings.\n\nLast week, Elon Musk announced that Dell Technologies DELL and SMCI will be providing hardware for his AI supercomputer project. DELL was up about 8% last week and SMCI has gained 7%. The SMCI stock has gained 217% this year, while Dell has jumped more than 90%. Investors can play SMCI via Global X Data Center And Digital Infrastructure ETF DTCR as the stock has more than 5% weight in the fund.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ives said that the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started and the clock is showing \u201c9p.m. in a party going till 4 a.m. with the rest of the tech world now joining.\u201d Ives thinks spending on GPUs and data centers is the \u201conly game in town.\u201d Ives thinks the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of AI benefited major technology giants leading the AI race, with the second, third and fourth \u201cderivatives\u201d beginning to show trickle-down effects on other companies.\n\nIn a separate investing event, Ives recently predicted that the AI-led bull run can last for another two to three years, saying in a year from now investors will be looking at $3 trillion to $4 trillion market caps for major tech companies.\n\n\u201cThe tech bull market is just starting,\u201d Ives reportedly said.\n\nIn his latest note Ives highlighted several stocks which he believes can benefit from the AI revolution. In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Best AI Stock Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst?\n\nAsif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush shocked everyone recently when he said during an interview with CNBC that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0is the \u201cmost undervalued AI play\u201d right now. Ives thinks the \u201cAI component\u201d of Tesla could be worth between $1 trillion to $2 trillion.\n\nIves is banking on August 8 as a \u201chistorical day\u201d for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Musk is slated to unveil his robotaxi plan on August 8, which he chalked out after reportedly scrapping off his previous plan to launch an affordable EV for the mass market.\n\nIves said that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0could \u201cdouble\u201d over the next 12-18 months because of its fully autonomous driving plans that will take shape in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIves thinks Tesla has gone through a \u201cCategory 5 Hurricane\u201d amid softer demand for EVs especially in China, but the analyst thinks the \u201cCinderella Story\u201d will return to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0and AI will be the \u201cking.\u201d The analyst said the softening demand for EVs called for an \u201cadult in the room\u201d situation at Tesla, and Elon Musk \u201cstepped up\u201d and took the necessary steps which could bode well for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). He was referring to the massive layoffs announced by Tesla recently which have caused a 14% downsizing at Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nBaron Partners Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the Fund\u2019s underperformance this quarter stemmed from the Fund\u2019s 10-year investment in\u00a0Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla\u2019s shares fell 29.3% during the period and detracted 13.41% from the Fund\u2019s first quarter results. Although Tesla has contributed importantly to the Fund\u2019s performance since 2014, on occasion it has detracted from quarterly performance. In previous instances when Tesla shares have underperformed during a discrete period, they have shortly afterwards reflected the strong growth of the underlying business and the stock has appreciated considerably. We believe that will be the case again, although cannot guarantee it.\n\nA significant decline also occurred at the end of 2022. In that instance, investors had become concerned about a host of external factors. Investors believed the company founder, visionary, and CEO Elon Musk was distracted by his acquisition of Twitter. They also believed a weak Chinese economy emerging from COVID and U.S. government policies would curtail the purchases of Tesla vehicles. These fears proved to be overblown. As the company achieved milestones in the succeeding year, the stock subsequently doubled over the next 12 months\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "The Next Big Thing After AI? 3 Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before the Boom",
        "content": "Chasing the next trend thing after AI is easier said than done. It is also a pretty risky strategy. Companies that have ambitious goals also need a good deal of cash to achieve growth in their areas of focus. Many such companies end up running out of capital and going bankrupt. And for those that do, investors certainly don\u2019t want to be caught in a dilution cycle as they churn through that process.\n\nThat said, it is possible to make many promising investments to try and catch the next mega trend after AI. Certain sleeper stocks have strong underlying businesses and are sitting on a boatload of cash. Many of these firms have enough funding and excitement to keep operations going until they hit profitability. If they become successful, you\u2019ll be laughing your way to the bank in the long-run.\n\nHere are three such sleeper stocks to consider right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CRSP) logo within a DNA sequence\n\nSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.com\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is a pioneering gene-editing company revolutionizing the treatment of serious diseases. With a robust $2.1 billion cash position as of Q1 2024, I believe CRISPR is well-funded to weather any near-term R&D challenges and forge ahead with its CRISPR-based therapies.\n\nIn my view, gene editing is poised to be the next transformative megatrend in biotech, and CRISPR Therapeutics is leading the charge. The company\u2019s CRISPR/Cas9 platform enables precise genomic modifications to treat a wide range of devastating illnesses, from rare blood disorders to common cardiovascular conditions.\n\nCRISPR isn\u2019t just a one-trick pony, either. Beyond its approved CASGEVY treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, the company has a deep pipeline spanning oncology, diabetes, and in vivo therapies. With ongoing trials for next-gen CAR-T candidates CTX112 and CTX131, plus in vivo assets CTX310 and CTX320, I expect a steady stream of catalysts to fuel CRSP\u2019s momentum in the coming years.\n\nYes, biotech investing carries inherent risks. But CRISPR Therapeutics\u2019 diversified portfolio and rock-solid balance sheet set it apart. In a field littered with cash-burning, all-or-nothing bets, CRSP stock appears to be built for the long-haul.\n\nIf you\u2019re seeking exposure to a cutting-edge field with enormous disruptive potential, look no further than CRISPR. If this tech pays off as many think it can, this is a company that likely holds enormous upside.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is a quantum computing company making serious headway in identifying potential production applications. I believe quantum computing could be the next big thing after AI, and IonQ is well-positioned to benefit from this megatrend.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 2024, IonQ exceeded the high end of its revenue guidance, delivering $7.6 million versus a range of $6.5-7.5 million. Since going public in 2021, the company has outperformed its quarterly revenue midpoint for 10 straight quarters.\n\nIn addition, IonQ raised its bookings guidance for the year, citing the passage of the U.S. federal budget and strong customer interest in quantum computing and networking. The company booked $250,000 of revenue in Q1 and noted its pipeline is stronger than ever.\n\nWhile IonQ is seeing heavy losses today, I believe it could be a needle-mover in the next big hype cycle. However, investors should know this is a very long-term, risky bet. IonQ does not have enough cash to survive until profitability, and it could take a decade or more for quantum computing to become something tangible. But who knows? Maybe it could also jump into people\u2019s lives in a flash like AI.\n\nFor the record, I don\u2019t think this company will run out of cash. The company\u2019s current pile is notable. Sleeper stocks: IONQ cash chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nEven if IonQ runs out of private funding or performs badly in the stock market, the government is unlikely to allow a setback in quantum computing. For those betting on this long-term trend, this is a stock to consider in my view.\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Smartphone with logo of American eVTOL company Joby Aviation on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for commercial passenger service. Flying cars could be the next big thing in transportation, and Joby is making remarkable progress toward this futuristic vision. In Q1, the company started submitting system-level test plans, a key part of the fourth stage of the FAA-type certification process. As such, it could potentially start commercial operations in 2025.\n\nI believe Joby is well-positioned to be the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of this industry, as it has the largest cash pile among competitors and has formed partnerships with major players like Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). While the concept of flying cars is still very experimental, the cooperation from authorities so far is encouraging. Wealthy individuals in big cities may be willing to pay a premium for the convenience of flying car rides.\n\nRides in big cities are pretty expensive anyway. Uber\u2019s CEO was shocked when a journalist told him he paid $52 for a 3-mile ride. Thus, a profitable flying car business could be doable if people are already paying that much.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Considering Buying Tesla Stock? This May Be A Better Alternative",
        "content": "Considering Buying Tesla Stock? This May Be A Better Alternative\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on investors\u2019 radar after the company's shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation package, a move analysts believe could spark the beginning of a possible rebound in the stock, which is down 25% so far this year amid growth concerns and falling demand for electric vehicles. After the shareholder approval, Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla's \"Master Plan 4\u201d would be \"epic.\" Master plans have played a key role in the company\u2019s product and business strategy in the past. Tesla Master Plan 3 was revealed back in 2023 and touted a focus on AI capabilities to develop fully self-driving cars, a transition away from fossil fuels, and scaling the company business to \"extreme size.\"\n\nTesla bulls are also back in the limelight. Cathie Wood, who owns a $910.32 million stake in the EV maker through her ARK Investment Management, recently said the stock will hit $2,600 by 2029, while her bull case pegs the stock price estimate at $3,100. Ms. Wood\u2019s bear case price target \u2014$2,000 \u2014 represents a whopping 982% upside potential based on TSLA\u2019s closing price of $184.86 on June 18.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities, another Tesla bull, said the pay package issue resolution could begin a new chapter in Tesla\u2019s growth story. He reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock with a $350 price target.\n\nMusk's Pay Package Won't Solve Tesla's Growth Problems\n\nHowever, Tesla skeptics believe even if Elon Musk succeeds in getting his multibillion-dollar pay package, the core issues haunting Tesla won\u2019t get resolved on their own. They believe investors are banking too much on the upcoming Robotaxi event scheduled for Aug. 8, in which the company is expected to reveal its much-hyped Robotaxi, which Musk claimed would be without steering wheels or pedals. Tesla's renewed focus on Robotaxis comes after Musk reportedly canceled plans to build a mass-market, affordable EV in the range of $25,000.\n\nElon Musk is likely targeting the premium Robotaxi market, as the affordable EV segment is being dominated by Chinese competitors who are rolling out electric cars with budgets as low as $10,000 (for example, BYD\u2019s Seagull EV, which was revealed earlier this year).\n\nRobotaxis \"Years Away\" from Mass Adoption\n\nBut analysts don\u2019t expect Robotaxis to solve Tesla\u2019s growth problem. According to a Wall Street Journal report, RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan thinks Robotaxis are likely \"years away from mass-market adoption.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then there\u2019s competition, both at home and abroad. Last year, Chinese EV maker BYD Co. surpassed Tesla to become the world\u2019s (not only China\u2019s) biggest EV company.\n\nTesla's Valuation\n\nOver the past 18 months, Tesla has missed its sales estimates and announced price cuts, layoffs, and strategy shifts. In the first quarter, Tesla\u2019s profit fell 55%. Wall Street expects Tesla\u2019s earnings to fall about 17% this year. As of June 19, the stock is still trading at 74x forward earnings, much higher than the industry average multiple of 15.88.\n\nTesla is in a major transition phase, which, if it hits the mark, would take several months if not years to bear fruit. That\u2019s why there are better alternatives to look at if you are considering buying an EV stock.\n\nGeneral Motors Co (NYSE:GM): A Better Buy Than Tesla\n\nGeneral Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has become a formidable competitor to Tesla in the EV market while its gasoline engine continues to grow. Unlike Tesla, General Motors can play on both ends of the market, ramping up investments in internal combustion engine (ICE) cars amid strong demand as well as producing affordable EVs and positioning itself for the future. General Motors recently pledged to invest more in gas-powered trucks and sport-utility vehicles and indicated a decrease in futuristic projects like robotaxis. General Motors' iconic trucks, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, raked in strong sales in the first quarter as competitors Ford and Stellantis lost ground.\n\nThe stock recently hit 52-week highs as it announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program and increased its dividend by 33%.\n\nAnalysts believe General Motors is well on its way to becoming one of the biggest EV companies in the world. General Motors expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, matching Wall Street's consensus estimate. The company recently launched Chevrolet Equinox, while its low-priced version is expected later this year. GM's EV production jumped 74% in the first quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nGeneral Motors reported strong Q1 results in April and increased its adjusted pretax profit outlook for the year from $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion, up from $12 billion to $14 billion. Net income in the year is now expected between $10.1 billion and $11.5 billion, above its previous guidance of $9.8 billion to $11.2 billion.\n\nDespite these growth catalysts and earnings upside, General Motors is trading at a forward P/E of 4.99, much lower than the industry median multiple of 17. This multiple is paltry when compared with Tesla's (74). With a dividend, a strong pipeline of EVs as well as a growing gasoline cars business, General Motors is a much better stock to buy when compared with Tesla.\n\nAre You Missing Out on Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.\n\nThis article Considering Buying Tesla Stock?

        "content": "Working for Elon Musk can be the very definition of precarious employment. The entire Tesla Supercharger staff found that out the hard way when they were collectively given the sack with little explanation.\n\nNow it\u2019s Joe Benarroch\u2019s turn. The former head of global business operations for X\u2014personally hired by CEO Linda Yaccarino just days into her job\u2014is out after barely more than a year, according to his profile on LinkedIn.\n\nAnd the former NBCUniversal global advertising chair could herself be in the crosshairs, according to a report by the Financial Times on Sunday. Citing anonymous informed sources, the FT wrote that Yaccarino felt pressured to shake up her management team, firing Benarroch for allegedly failing to properly flag clients in advance that X would soon permit the consensual sharing of porn, citing three sources at the company. (Pornography has long been present on Twitter, but it was not officially permitted previously.)\n\nWhile Benarroch\u2019s reported blindsiding of clients could clearly have negative effects, Musk himself has also provided reasons for them to feel confused. Musk attempted to lure popular streamers away from Twitch by shaming the Amazon-owned rival over its failure to police its own platform for adult content. Flip-flopping just weeks later to make porn officially permissible content was bound to be controversial.\n\nNUDES IN BIO\n\n\u2014 dream (@dreamwastaken) May 20, 2024\n\nWhen approached by Fortune for comment, X replied with the automated statement, \u201cBusy now, please check back later.\u201d Benarroch did not respond on X to a request for comment.\n\nMusk\u2019s social media platform has labored under heavy losses ever since he added $1 billion in annual interest to its cost base in order to fund his $44 billion acquisition in late October 2022.\n\nWhile X remains a privately owned company, its problems potentially threaten to spill over to Tesla, as the EV manufacturer is the main source of wealth for Musk and share sales have been used to finance his Twitter endeavor. Tesla stock is down 50% since Musk\u2019s interest in the social media platform became public in April 2022.\n\nIn September, Yaccarino suggested X could actually turn a profit in early 2024. But an investigation by a nonprofit showing evidence that X had placed ads next to pro-Nazi posts subsequently triggered an exodus of advertisers from companies like Disney and ignited fresh worries over a possible financial collapse. Instead of diplomacy, Musk opted to go on the attack, threatening to name and shame advertisers in the event of X\u2019s bankruptcy.\n\nStory continues\n\nDirect threat to Yaccarino\u2019s authority\n\nMusk appears unsatisfied with the pace of improvement at X and recently tapped his Boring Co. CEO Steve Davis to have a closer look at its cost base in what Yaccarino confidants told the FT was a direct challenge to her authority.\n\nYaccarino herself has faced constant speculation she is little more than a puppet CEO installed to take the heat off Musk\u2019s management of the company and, when necessary, fall on any grenades for the centibillionaire.\n\nWhen she opened up last week about her difficulties in overcoming impostor syndrome\u2014the feeling that one hasn\u2019t truly earned their status and position\u2014she was asked what was the best message she had ever received from him.\n\nWelcome to the flock, @benarroch_joe! From one bird to the next.\n\nLet\u2019s get to work @Twitter! #timetofly\n\n\u2014 Linda Yaccarino (@lindayaX) June 4, 2023\n\nRather than cite an example of how he builds her up or encourages her to achieve her best, the first thing that came to Yaccarino\u2019s mind was the day Musk announced\u00a0her hire\u2014not anything that happened in the 13 months since.\n\nYaccarino\u2019s room to maneuver already was limited amid the ongoing losses, and now she has to bear the blame for having personally vouched for Benarroch, her former aide, in the first place.\n\nUnless Yaccarino can better tap into her extensive Rolodex to lure back her contacts in the ad industry, Benarroch may not be the only former NBCUniversal executive to find themselves updating their LinkedIn profile.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) second-quarter deliveries preview note, UBS analysts predict the electric vehicle giant will fall short of market expectations for Q2 deliveries.\n\nThey forecast around 420,000 deliveries, a 10% decrease year-over-year but a 9% increase from Q1. This revised estimate is below the 445,000 consensus on Visible Alpha and sits at the higher end of buy-side expectations, which UBS gauges at 410,000-425,000.\n\nUBS highlights that \"the stock tends to react more towards results vs. the headline (consensus) figure,\" suggesting the final delivery number might hold more weight than the initial miss. They plan to revisit their financial model after official figures are released.\n\nLooking at specific regions, UBS expects deliveries in the US to be slightly below Q1's pace. However, they believe May's 0.99% financing offer for Model Y might have pulled some sales forward from June. An improvement in Model 3 deliveries is also expected due to resolved production challenges.\n\nIn Europe, deliveries are estimated to be down sharply year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to declining demand in key markets. China, however, is a bright spot, with deliveries showing a modest increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.\n\nBeyond deliveries, UBS cautions that gross margins might be impacted despite an expected improvement in US and China deliveries.\n\nWhile the upcoming \"Tesla AI Day\" on August 8th might generate excitement around AI initiatives, UBS believes their financial impact is further out. The focus for the near-to-mid term will be on the new vehicle reveal, which could influence 2025 and 2026 estimates.\n\nUBS expects the new vehicle to be distinct from the Model 3 and Y but with fewer features to achieve a lower price point.\n\nUBS concludes by suggesting Tesla's stock price might diverge from current business fundamentals as investor focus shifts towards future growth and AI prospects.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUBS sees Tesla missing market's Q2 delivery target by 25,000\n\nUS Supreme Court takes up 'Dewberry' trademark dispute\n\nBritain's FTSE 100 climbs as Prudential provides boost\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Elon Musk won his Tesla pay battle. Now he has to win his legal war",
        "content": "A new legal battle is underway to determine whether Elon Musk actually gets his money after Tesla convinced shareholders to back the CEO's $56 billion pay plan.\n\nTesla filed court documents last week before the same Delaware Chancery Court judge who previously voided Musk\u2019s compensation, arguing the June 13 shareholder vote offered a \u201cprincipled resolution\" to end the dispute in Musk\u2019s favor.\n\nAn attorney for the shareholder who successfully sued to block the pay package argued in a separate court filing Friday that Tesla\u2019s shareholder resolution should have no legal effect on the judge\u2019s original decision, and that Tesla is not empowered to use an extra-judicial vote to overrule the Delaware court.\n\nThis attorney, Greg Varallo, said Tesla must appeal the judge\u2019s decision to the Delaware Supreme Court if it wants to reverse it.\n\nFor Tesla (TSLA), there is a lot riding on the uncertain path that Musk\u2019s disputed pay plan must now take through the US court system. Tesla CEO Elon Musk waves as he leaves the Tesla Gigafactory near Berlin, Germany on March 13. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIf the courts give Tesla what it wants, it can keep Musk\u2019s plan in place along with a $2.5 billion accounting charge it took back in 2018 when shareholders first agreed to the all-stock-option, performance-based deal.\n\nIf not, the electric-vehicle maker could instead be forced to hold a third vote on Musk\u2019s pay, plus book a charge of at least $25 billion that could threaten future earnings.\n\n\u201cEverything here is unprecedented,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, an executive compensation expert and finance professor for University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business who testified for Tesla in a trial over the plan.\n\nThe unprecedented nature of Tesla\u2019s dispute means its resolution may be equally uncharted.\n\nThe new legal battle swings the spotlight back to Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick, who ruled in January that Tesla\u2019s board didn\u2019t act \"in the best interests\" of Tesla shareholders in approving the $56 billion Musk pay pact. Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick, right, voided Elon Musk's pay package in January. REUTERS/Kathleen Flynn (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMcCormick must now rule on whether the new shareholder vote does in fact restore Musk\u2019s pay, according to Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane School of Law.\n\nMcCormick could choose to rule on the dispute by considering written and oral arguments from both sides, Lipton said,\n\nAlternatively, the judge could ask the parties to submit more information, as well as engage in additional discovery to bring to light other facts and evidence. The judge could also hold hearings akin to a new trial, Lipton added.\n\nTesla has asked the judge to set an expedited schedule during which the parties will submit court documents containing additional rationale for their positions. Tesla said each party should be allowed to make those arguments before McCormick enters a final judgement in the matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Friday Tesla\u2019s lawyers described the recent shareholder vote backing Musk's pay as \"one of the most well-informed stockholder votes in recent memory,\" and noted that two of the world\u2019s most sophisticated investors, BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard, said yes to the proposal.\n\nTesla has said 72% of votes cast by shareholders, excluding Musk and his brother Kimbal, were in favor of the compensation package.\n\nA hearing before McCormick is set for July 8, during which she is also scheduled to take up additional unresolved matters in the case.\n\nOne is a request from the shareholders\u2019 lawyer for $6 billion in legal fees, which Tesla disputes.\n\nAnd in the event McCormick validates Musk's compensation, she could weigh in on whether the shareholder vote turns back the clock to reactivate the agreement as of 2018. Tesla has reported that retroactively accounting for the compensation plan would save the company at least $25 billion.\n\n\"She could say [to Tesla], 'You did the right thing. You took it back to shareholders\u2026I might not like it, but it's not my role to get involved in the contracting between consenting adults,'\" Murphy said.\n\nBut \"I doubt she'll do that, which means we'll go through an appeal,\" Murphy added.\n\nLipton said this judge is unlikely to have final say.\n\n\"Whichever side loses, that side will appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court,\" Lipton added.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Most Hated Brand in the US",
        "content": "The article lists the most hated brand in the US.\n\nWhy Consumers Hate on Brands\n\nWhen we look at some of the worst companies in the world, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what made them the \u201cworst\u201d in the first place. Such strong sentiments usually emerge from brand hatred, allowing customers to express negative views and perceptions of a particular brand. Oftentimes, companies make their way on the list of most hated companies because of their impact on people's lives, the environment, or even politics. As per the duplex theory, consumers often end up disliking a brand when their expectations remain unmet.\n\nIn this context, The Customer, an internet news company, reveals that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the most hated brands in the US. Their study, relying exclusively on Twitter data, reports that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) received 48.35% negative tweets back in 2021. A similar study by Merchant Machine revealed that the company received 69% negative tweets in 2023. Twitter users have been tweeting about expensive rates, driver cancellations, smelly cars, feeling unsafe, and even unprofessional behavior.\n\nAnother business that has been on these lists is Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA), largely because of how they impact society. Since at least the 2010s, the video game company\u00a0Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) has been at the center of many problems. These issues include buying other companies and using unfair business practices in their own games. There have also been lawsuits alleging that Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) used unfair business practices when signing sports related contracts. Consumerist named the company the \"Worst Company in America\" in 2012 and 2013. In 2018, USA Today ranked it as the 5th most hated company in the US.\n\nCar companies are often at the top of these lists too, with names like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) joining the ranks of the most hated companies. The car company is notorious for \u201cputting profits over people\u201d. Every once in a while, they end up making a product that puts many lives at stake. Nevertheless, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) deliberately continues making them. One of the most prominent examples of Ford\u2019s failures has got to be the Edsel. There were reports of mechanical flaws with the Edsel, largely due to a lack of quality control and confusion with other Ford parts. Industries like fashion, oil, social networks, computers, and pharmaceuticals are often on lists of the worst brands as well. Popular brand Balenciaga is on the list of the most hated brands in the US because of controversial ads and sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bottom-line is that being successful in business does not always guarantee user satisfaction. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), for instance, is a large-cap growth company in the Automotive & Truck Manufacturers industry. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a market value of $583.75 billion, making it a mega-capitalization company (market capitalization above $200 billion). For many reasons, though, it looks like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is most likely to be the most hated company in the world. There is a long list of problems with this company, from working conditions to the way the owner, Elon Musk, presents his political views to the public.\n\nOthers have said that Tesla's marketing is dishonest, that it breaks promises, and that it is a scam. Critics have pointed out that Tesla downplays problems and is said to have punished several people who reported issues. People have even questioned if Tesla cars and services are safe and of good quality. Many reports from the past few years indicate that faulty car suspension can cause sudden, unintended acceleration, brake failure, and wheels collapsing. Users have complained about the sloppy implementation of some features, such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (which lets Tesla drivers play games while the car is moving).\n\nThere have been many claims that Musk and his company are guilty of fraud, including buying out SolarCity, selling faulty cars, making false claims, and sending out careless tweets. Musk agreed to pay a fine and step down as head of Tesla after one tweet. Five of the world's biggest tech companies have been accused of supporting child labor in Africa, where children were made to mine cobalt, a metal used to make batteries for phones and computers. Elon Musk's car company, Tesla, is one of these companies. The Most Hated Brand in the US\n\nImage by Blomst from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of most hated brands in the US, we have used information from the website Axios for our research. The Axios Harris Poll 100 is a reliable list of the companies that Americans care about the most when it comes to their image. Their method is based on talking to random Americans online. Along with this site's list, we used lists from trustworthy sources such as 24/7 Wall Street, CNBC, Business Insider, and Reddit, to name a few. We kept the information from some of those lists that are more than 5 years old because we thought that the most hated names that had been on them for a long time should stay there. We also matched the lists with customer reviews and comments to get the most complete results. Some brands stay on these lists all the time, while others got there because of changes in customers' experiences or concerns about politics or society.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nBased on our study, this is the most hated brand in the US.\n\n1.\u00a0The Trump Organization\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 15\n\nPeople despise Trump because he has used his authority to speak out against abortion. His entire life has revolved around breaking vows, breaking promises, bragging about his prowess with women, ranking women by grade, mocking women, demeaning women, and harassing women. People refer to him as a grandiose, malignant narcissist. He does not respect the Constitution and has turned the Republican Party into a loyalty test. Trump has surpassed parties and nations in importance.\n\nHe downplayed the reality of COVID-19 as the number of cases rose. Since Donald Trump and Mike Pence entered the White House, they have targeted the LGBTQ+ community's progress toward full equality and damaged the rights of many Americans. All of these issues have spread to his businesses and industries, so this company is on the top of every list of the most hated brands in the US.\n\nCheck out our complete list of 15 Most Hated Brands in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most hated brands to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields.

        "title": "Tesla, opponents of Musk's pay package clash over resolving compensation lawsuit",
        "content": "Electric vehicle-maker Tesla and opponents of CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package clashed on Friday as they look to resolve the legal dispute over the package and billions of dollars in potential legal fees that hinge on its outcome.\n\nThe automaker said in a court filing that the Delaware judge who voided Musk's compensation package in a January ruling should recognize that shareholders voted to reinstate the package this month and reverse her prior ruling.\n\nThough shareholders voted on June 13 to reinstate the compensation plan that was originally approved in 2018, it remains on hold pending the resolution of the lawsuit.\n\nThe legal team for Richard Tornetta, the shareholder who sued to invalidate Musk's pay package, countered that Tesla shareholders voting to reinstate the pay plan has no legal effect, so Tesla must appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court to reverse the January ruling.\n\nTESLA SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO REINSTATE MUSK'S $56B PAY PACKAGE The fate of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's compensation plan lies with the court after shareholders voted to reinstate the package that a judge voided in January.\n\nFurther, they argued that before Tesla can file its appeal, the Delaware judge who issued the ruling, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, has to determine the legal fee that Tesla must pay them for winning the case.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nTornetta's attorneys had previously asked for 29 million shares of Tesla stock, an amount worth over $5 billion, as the legal fee. They said Friday that Tesla could pay them at least $1.1 billion as an alternative \u2013 which would be based on precedent in the Delaware Court of Chancery, although they characterized that amount as \"unfairly low.\"\n\nMUSK DISHES ON TALKS WITH TRUMP DURING TESLA SHAREHOLDER MEETING Musk's compensation plan was based on Tesla hitting certain performance-based targets.\n\nTesla said the judge should put aside the dispute over legal fees and instead determine the impact of the shareholder vote, which could drastically reduce the legal fee. It also indicated it plans to file a motion to reverse the January ruling that should result in it winning the case.\n\nThe company argued that because the pay package was reviewed by an independent board member and reapproved by shareholders, it resolved the judge's finding that Musk dominated the negotiations due to his personal relationships with some board members and that the board didn't adequately disclose information about the compensation plan.\n\nELON MUSK HAD NVIDIA SEND AI CHIPS INTENDED FOR TESLA TO X AND XAI: REPORT Opponents of Musk's pay plan argue the shareholder vote has no legal significance.\n\nTornetta's legal team rejected that approach, arguing that the board process for proposing the ratification vote was flawed and that the shareholder vote was coerced by Musk's threats to potentially shift his focus on artificial intelligence (AI) investment away from Tesla without more control.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk's pay package, which consists of performance-based targets that trigger stock option awards that he must hold for a period of five years before exercising, was valued at $56 billion at the time the last milestone was achieved, according to Tesla.\n\nThe value of the package fluctuates with changes in Tesla's stock price and is worth about $48 billion based on Friday's share price of $182.19.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Tesla, opponents of Musk's pay package clash over resolving compensation lawsuit\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Elon\u2019s Golden Handcuffs: Why Tesla\u2019s Pay Package Is Even Worse Than the GameStop ATM",
        "content": "Which is worse: Elon Musk\u2019s $46 billion pay package or GameStop\u2019s $3 billion ATM?\r\nThis article is mostly about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Tesla stock. However, a guest essay in the New York Times by J. Bradford DeLong, an economics history professor at the University of California, got me thinking about both of these economic travesties.\n\nWith Tesla stock, its shareholders reapproved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $46 billion pay package originally thrown out in January by the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Chancellor Kathleen McCormick agreed with plaintiff shareholders who argued his 2018 pay package was over the top.\n\nShareholders didn\u2019t see it this way. Approximately 72% of the votes were for the pay package, which does not include Musk\u2019s shares or his brother\u2019s, who sits on the board.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCircling back to DeLong\u2019s guest essay, he gets into the whole idea of meme stocks, using GameStop (NYSE:GME) as a classic example. Its recent use of meme-stock mania to raise $3 billion in at-the-market funding highlights the problems associated with uninformed investors buying stock not worth the paper the shares were written on.\n\nThese two situations are examples of the outlandish misuse of shareholder funds. Here\u2019s why Tesla\u2019s actions are far worse for markets than GameStop\u2019s shenanigans.\n\nGameStop Broke No Laws\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen took advantage of meme-stock mania, and raised $3 billion in cash for the beleaguered video game retailer, all of which could be invested in other companies.\n\nIn late May, I discussed how the company\u2019s ATM offering proves that public companies still matter.\n\n\u201c[A] privately held version of GameStop would likely not be in nearly as good a financial position without the ability to raise cash through ATM offerings,\u201d I wrote on May 30.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a longtime shareholder, especially one who bought at $80 in 2021 and still holds, the ability of a public company such as GameStop to make such a move is a tremendous godsend.\u201d\n\nWhile it boggles my mind that anyone would trust Ryan Cohen to pick stocks when he\u2019s done absolutely nothing to fix the core business after owning shares since August 2020 and as CEO since last September, it bears repeating that GameStop\u2019s broken no laws.\n\nIf politicians don\u2019t like it, they should encourage the SEC to change the rules.\n\nExcessive Pay Is Only an Issue If Shareholders Say It Is\n\nElon Musk\u2019s pay package is obscene. There\u2019s no other way to describe it. Paying the world\u2019s wealthiest person, who already has $208 billion, another $46 billion on top of that, is akin to paying Happy Gilmore $100 million to join the LIV Golf tour. It makes no sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet all his sycophants trotted out their most complimentary comments before and after the result was announced.\n\n\u201c\u2018We think that Elon is critical to Tesla\u2019s success,\u2019 said Tasha Keeney, director of investment analysis at ARK Invest, which counts the automaker among its largest holdings. \u2018I think it\u2019s very important that Elon stays at the helm,\u2019\u201d the New York Times reported on June 13.\n\nKeeney\u2019s boss, Cathie Wood, appeared on CNBC on the day of the vote, suggesting that TSLA stock could reach $2,600 by 2029. Wood is known to throw out Tesla predictions, primarily because it\u2019s such a large portion of the assets under her control.\n\nIf Tesla has no Elon, she would probably have to close her asset management business.\n\nInterestingly, while shareholders had no problem voting for Musk\u2019s pay package, the Chancery Court could stick by its ruling, which would bring Tesla\u2019s board back to square one, searching for a way to keep the man-child focused long enough to stick around and design new, reasonably-priced, electric vehicles for mass consumption.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Tesla Stock\n\nNow that Musk looks prepared to stick around for 3-5 years, longtime shareholders can rest easy knowing that his attention will be EVs, not his other ventures. However, shareholders have no assurances that he won\u2019t up and leave this time next year without warning or an explanation.\n\nIn Q4 2021, Tesla\u2019s gross automotive margin was 30.6%. By Q4 2022, it was 470 basis points lower at 25.9%. Five quarters later, it\u2019s 17.4%, 43% lower over the past nine quarters.\n\nHow is that irreplaceable? It\u2019s a terrible message to send to front line Tesla employees. It will hurt the company more than we know.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla Stock (NASDAQ:TSLA): 2 Catalysts That Indicate a Turnaround",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has performed poorly over the past 12 months due to several factors, ranging from strong competition in the EV space to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s distractions from the company, all exacerbated by valuation concerns. However, I believe two short-term catalysts could indicate that Tesla has hit bottom, so I am bullish on the company\u2019s turnaround prospects today.\n\nIn this article,\u00a0I will detail these catalysts and explain why they may justify the company\u2019s current premium valuation.\n\nThe Robotaxi Potential\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s shareholder meeting, Elon Musk elaborated on its Robotaxi plans, providing significant insights for Tesla stock investors. Musk explained Tesla\u2019s business model for the Robotaxi service, comparing it to a blend of Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). This model consists of two main components:\n\nTesla will own and operate a fleet of cars. When a user reserves a ride in one of these vehicles, the payment goes directly to Tesla. Additionally, a significant number of robotaxis will\u00a0be owned\u00a0by private individuals. These privately-owned vehicles will also be available for reservation, and the payments for these rides will go to the vehicle owners. This setup allows for flexibility, as owners might offer rides for free to family members or friends.\n\nThis dual-ownership model aims to maximize the availability and utilization of Robotaxis, leveraging both Tesla\u2019s fleet and privately owned vehicles to meet demand.\n\nOne of\u00a0the primary challenges Tesla faces\u00a0is overcoming regulatory hurdles to get its self-driving cars on the roads globally. There are already a few states in the U.S. with autonomous vehicle laws\u00a0and driverless cars operating\u00a0in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas.\u00a0These existing autonomous cars are paving the way for broader regulatory approval in the U.S., which Tesla believes will facilitate its entry into these markets.\n\nElon Musk has noted that it is beneficial for Tesla that other autonomous car companies are cutting through the regulatory jungle. These companies\u2019 operations and data collection in challenging areas help Tesla by providing insights and easing the path for its vehicles. Interestingly, unlike in other\u00a0areas\u00a0where Tesla prefers to lead, Tesla is comfortable not being the first mover in this scenario. Tesla remains confident that its technology will be superior once fully operational.\n\nOn August 8, Tesla will unveil its Robotaxi service. According to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, a long-term Tesla bull, this day will mark a historical event as the company reveals its broader strategy. Ives believes that the market will witness the execution of this strategy alongside the launch of a sub-$30,000 vehicle. He suggests that the bottom for Tesla is in and argues that betting against Elon Musk is the wrong call, considering Tesla\u2019s extensive installed base and deep involvement in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom my perspective,\u00a0valuing Tesla solely as an electric vehicle\u00a0manufacturer\u00a0doesn\u2019t fully capture\u00a0its worth, especially given its valuation, which far surpasses that of traditional car companies.\u00a0The prospect of the Robotaxi service is unprecedented. This disruptive technology, though intangible,\u00a0stands out as a compelling reason for investors to find Tesla\u2019s premium valuation of 74x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio appealing.\n\nTesla\u2019s Leader Is Re-Engaged\n\nIn recent years, concerns have arisen about Elon Musk\u2019s ability to focus on Tesla, given his involvement in multiple ventures such as SpaceX, Neuralink, and others. Critics argue that Tesla requires a dedicated leader, and Musk\u2019s divided attention could potentially harm the company\u2019s success.\n\nHowever, Elon Musk is deeply intertwined with Tesla, embodying its vision and driving innovation. Despite his busy schedule, recent developments indicate a renewed focus on Tesla. This \u201cold school\u201d Musk appears revitalized, especially in light of recent votes of confidence from shareholders.\n\nDuring the recent Tesla shareholder meeting, shareholders re-approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation plan, highlighting their strong support for Musk\u2019s leadership at the company. However, the vote still requires formal legal approval, and its certainty remains uncertain, potentially leading to months of litigation. Earlier this year, the compensation plan encountered challenges in Delaware, where it was described as \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the approval of this plan had a notable impact on Tesla\u2019s stock, reflecting concerns about the company\u2019s leadership. Now, with a clearer indication that Musk will continue to lead Tesla with increased focus and energy, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas believes, and I concur, that there is potential for the company to unify strategies across Elon Musk\u2019s ventures, including xAI and the social media platform X.\n\nIs TSLA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus on Wall Street regarding TSLA reveals analysts are sitting on the fence with a Hold rating. Out of 33 analysts, 10 are Bullish, nine are bearish, and 14 are neutral. The average Tesla stock price target is $176.96, indicating a potential downside of 3.3%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough bearish momentum still prevails over TSLA due to its potentially stretched valuation based on ambitious future projections, I believe that the unveiling of the Robotaxi execution plans could justify TSLA\u2019s valuation. Additionally, resolving concerns over Elon Musk\u2019s leadership may mark a transition from bearish to bullish momentum for the world\u2019s largest EV company.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Li Auto Stock (NASDAQ:LI): What Has Gone Wrong?",
        "content": "A few years ago, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock was trading at over 200x forward earnings, reflecting high hopes for the Beijing-based company as China\u2019s main rival to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, despite being China\u2019s first profit-making new energy vehicle (NEV) maker, the stock has tumbled on slowing growth. I\u2019m still bullish, noting the company\u2019s strong balance sheet and attractive metrics, but I\u2019m increasingly wary about competition and anecdotal evidence about build quality.\n\nLi Auto\u2019s Changing Fortunes\n\nLi Auto stock had been flying high on entry into 2024, with the company ready to start deliveries of its first all-electric vehicle, the Li Mega. Sadly, the firm had pressed ahead with its initial design for the people-carrier type vehicle \u2014 or simply made very few changes to the original design \u2014 despite concerns about the car\u2019s appearance.\n\nAfter the car was released, Li Auto\u2019s CEO, Li Xiang, vowed to fight back against negative comments, which did seem a little unusual. Li Xiang, allegedly referencing the avalanche of criticism directed towards the Mega, said, \u201cFor those organized illegal and criminal acts, we are already dealing with them by legal means.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the appearance wasn\u2019t the only concern, but the company reportedly only delivered just over 3,000 of the Mega in March. That\u2019s less than half of what analysts had expected. The company had planned to sell around 8,000 of the premium vehicles every month.\n\nWhile deliveries of the Mega haven\u2019t lived up to expectations, there\u2019s been a broader dropoff in sales across the EREV (extended-range electric vehicle) range \u2014 essentially hybrids. This has concerned investors. Sales peaked at 50,353 vehicles in December before tumbling into the new year. May\u2019s deliveries represented the best performance of the year so far for Li, with 35,020 vehicles delivered to customers.\n\nWhile I understand that shareholders will be disappointed by the Mega\u2019s performance, I\u2019d suggest the falling share price \u2014 from as high as $46 in late February to just $18 \u2014 is an overreaction. The Mega might be ugly, but the tech, range, and charging speed are impressive. Likewise, Li Auto has delivered 141,207 vehicles so far this year. That\u2019s up 32.5% year-over-year. I still think that\u2019s pretty strong.\n\nCan Li Auto Still Prosper?\n\nTesla isn\u2019t the only competition facing Li Auto in China. Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and Huawei have both entered the market with vehicles packed with smart features. Moreover, NIO (NYSE:NIO) has been making a comeback, and there are dozens of new companies entering the sector, many of which have been drawn in by enticing government policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut can Li Auto still prosper? Well, with sales up 32.5% so far this year and being one of the only Tesla competitors that\u2019s already profit-making, I\u2019d argue that it already is. Looking forward, analysts suggest that the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) will improve by 10.6% annually over the next three to five years. Personally, I\u2019d suggest that\u2019s conservative, but it\u2019s still strong growth from a stock priced at 16x forward earnings.\n\nLi is also some distance ahead of its new peers, like Xiaomi, with multiple vehicles on sale, providing customers with real choice. On April 18, Li expanded its range further with the modestly priced L6. Starting around $41,000, the large family SUV adds to Li\u2019s range, which starts at around $28,000 and extends to $83,000.\n\nMoreover, the company currently has $2.1 billion of debt and cash reserves of around $13.6 billion. Given the strong cash position, we\u2019re actually looking at a forward EV-to-EBITDA ratio of just 6.6x. For context, Tesla has a forward EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 37.9x, although I understand that this isn\u2019t the perfect comparison, given Tesla\u2019s prospects in automation.\n\nFinally, albeit anecdotal evidence, a Russian blogging channel I\u2019ve been following for some time recently attempted to put the Li L9 through its paces, and it didn\u2019t perform well. This may be an exception, but it\u2019s one of the first non-Chinese reviews I\u2019ve seen for the car. Hopefully, it\u2019s just a one-off.\n\nIs Li Auto Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, LI comes in as a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys, two Holds, and no Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Li Auto stock price target is $35.05, implying 96.1% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Li Auto Stock\n\nI must confess that my faith in the stock has been tested in recent months, but I believe Li Auto is a strong business at a good price. Debt levels are low, and the company has plenty of cash to fund new R&D projects. It\u2019s also profit-making, which is more than we can say for many of Li\u2019s peers.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing that the Mega has performed so poorly, but I see this tanking share price as a good entry point. Moreover, the average share price target and the stock\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio give me further confidence.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Auto Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Boding well for the U.S. auto sector, the space\u2019s new vehicle sales jumped 8.8% last month versus April to 1.44 million. The figure also represented a 5% increase versus\u00a0the same period\u00a0a year earlier. And for the first five months of the year, sales climbed 3/5% compared with 2023. Meanwhile,\u00a0the fact that inflation was flat last month, spurring a decline in interest rates, was very positive for the sector.\n\nNot only will easing inflation increase Americans\u2019 spending power when they buy vehicles, but lower interest rates will make purchasing automobiles cheaper for the\u00a0lions\u2019 share\u00a0of consumers who take out loans to finance their purchases. Meanwhile, in another piece of good news for the sector, EV registrations\u00a0jumped 14% in April versus\u00a0the same period a year earlier to 102,317.\n\nAlthough the increase was partially spurred by price cuts, the data\u00a0point\u00a0shows that many Americans, contrary to the opinion of EV skeptics, are ready, willing, and able to buy EVs.\u00a0Here are three top auto stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Gaithersburg MD June 26, 2021 Carvana (CVNA) Auto Dealership\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Street appears to be becoming more bullish recently on online auto dealer\u00a0Carvana (NYSE:CVNA). CVNA stock jumped nearly 50% between April 17 and June 20, while two banks recently issued upbeat\u00a0assessments of the company.\n\nOn June 10,\u00a0JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) identified Carvana as a top pick. The bank believes\u00a0that the\u00a0company is well-positioned to benefit from supply shortages of used vehicles.\u00a0That\u2019s because\u00a0many \u201cfranchise and independent dealers\u201d are likely to deal with the shortage by purchasing more vehicles from Carvana, according to the bank.\u00a0JPMorgan also believes that the company is taking steps that will raise its profit margins.\n\nAnd after\u00a0analyzing web search trends, investment bank Evercore\u00a0added CVNA stock to its \u00a0positive tactical trading list. Carvana\u2019s search trends are strong, and the company\u2019s second-quarter results are likely to come in above analysts\u2019 average estimates, Evercore believes. Moreover the investment bank thinks that the company\u2019s \u201cleadership position in digital\u201d is boosting its market share.\n\nCarvana\u2019s\u00a0price-sales ratio of 2.2 times is\u00a0quite\u00a0low, and analysts, on average, expect its sales to climb 15% this year and 14% in 2025.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEncouragingly for\u00a0Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), 2,855 of its R1S large SUVs were registered in April in America, up from 1,259 in April\u00a0of\u00a02023. As a result, the R1S was the sixth highest-selling EV in the U.S. for that month. Impressively, the seven-seat SUV outsold Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck by a wide margin as only 2,181 Cybertrucks were registered.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Rivian\u00a0disclosed earlier this month that it would, by utilizing Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in its EVs, enhance their \u201crange, performance and computing power.\u201d\u00a0More specifically,\u00a0Rivian \u201creengineered (its) batteries and electrical architectures, while adding\u00a0driver-assistant features.\u201d\n\nAfter driving the enhanced EVs,\u00a0Elektrek reported on June 7 that the automaker \u201cis getting better at making electric vehicles.\u201d The author noted that the company\u2019s R1T pickup was able to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.7 seconds, and he wrote that he \u201cwas particularly impressed by the ability to control many different levels of traction controls and regenerative braking in\u00a0rally\u00a0and off-road modes.\u201d\u00a0The reviewer added\u00a0that \u201cBoth the R1S and R1T have a great balance of premium luxury experience and utilitarian capabilities.\u201d\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nLast month, Chinese EV and plug-in hybrid maker\u00a0BYD (OTC:BYDDY) sold 37,499 vehicles outside of its home market. That represented\u00a0an incredibly high\u00a0year-over-year jump of 268%.\n\nThe jump should\u00a0greatly\u00a0enhance the automaker\u2019s profitability since the company\u00a0charges double or triple the prices abroad compared with what it asks buyers to pay in China. The EUs recent decision to add a new 17% tariff to BYD\u2019s vehicles will cut into the higher profits\u00a0that it\u00a0obtains from the bloc.\u00a0However, its profit per vehicle in the EU will still be much higher than\u00a0in\u00a0China.\u00a0And since the automaker sold less than 38,000 EVs overseas, it has\u00a0a great deal of\u00a0room to grow in the EU and other markets.\n\nThe company\u2019s new hybrid vehicle, which\u00a0can reportedly drive for 1,200 miles without being charged or filled with gasoline, should\u00a0greatly\u00a0increase its sales and profits over the longer term.\n\nDespite the\u00a0strong,\u00a0positive catalysts, BYDDY stock has\u00a0a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.6, making it one of the best auto stocks\u00a0to buy.\n\nOn\u00a0the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN and BYDDY.

        "content": "By Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -Tesla and opponents of Elon Musk's compensation clashed on Friday over ways to resolve the legal quagmire that has engulfed the CEO's $56 billion pay package and billions of dollars in potential legal fees generated by the case.\n\nTesla said in a court filing that a Delaware judge should recognize a vote by Tesla shareholders in favor of the pay package and reverse her January ruling that voided the compensation.\n\nIn response, shareholder attorneys said the vote to ratify Musk's pay has no legal effect and the only way for Tesla to challenge the January ruling is to appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe shareholder attorneys said that before Tesla can appeal, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick has to determine the legal fee that the company should be ordered to pay them for winning the case.\n\nThey had previously asked for 29 million shares of Tesla stock, which is worth more than $5 billion.

        "content": "Hyundai Charges Ahead To Solidify Its EV Positioning Despite The Slowdown\n\nHyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) announced the launch of\u00a0two new electric vehicles in Europe\u00a0in an effort to boost its market share. The two new models,\u00a0an affordable\u00a0EV\u00a0called the Inster EV,and a new IONIQ model, are key segment launches. While its\u00a0rivals, including traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F), but also the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) are scaling back their efforts, Hyundai is increasing its efforts to fight for\u00a0leadership in the EV era. According to data from the Korean Automobile & Mobility Association, May already brought some sales records.\n\nAffordable EVs Are In The Air\n\nLast week, Hyundai provided a teaser of its low-cost\u00a0EV for the first time, with the\u00a0official debut of the Inster EV\u00a0scheduled for\u00a0the Busan International Mobility\u00a0that is scheduled to\u00a0kick off on June 27th.\u00a0The Inster\u00a0is key to Hyundai\u2019s plan for EVs to account for\u00a0at least\u00a014 percent of\u00a0its\u00a0total sales in Europe this year. Volkswagen Group (OTC: VWAGY) also just finished design work on its affordable all-electric ID. 2. Volkswagen is expected to launch the ID.2. by the end of the year, while Hyundai\u2019s Inster EV will\u00a0make its official global debut\u00a0before June ends and Tesla is only talking about working on a low-cost EV. With the looming debut of its entry-level EV, Volkswagen promised the ID.2. turned out even better than the concept. It\u00a0will be\u00a0will be one of ten new EVs that Volkswagen plans to launch by 2027.\n\nHyundai Already Made A\u00a0Record In\u00a0May\n\nIn May,\u00a0IONIQ 5 set a\u00a0new monthly sales record with\u00a04,449 units sold, bringing the cumulative total of the first five months of 2024 to\u00a0nearly 15,000\u00a0units. Kia also made its own record as it\u00a0sold 7,766 electric SUVs through May, while it also expects to gain the\u00a0$7,500 tax credit\u00a0and further boost demand. Later this year,\u00a0Hyundai is opening its first EV and battery plant in the US\u00a0and once it\u00a0begins\u00a0assembling the IONIQ 5,\u00a0it should also have a contender to\u00a0qualify for the tax credit.Already, the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, are some of the most affordable and efficient EVs on the market, with the upcoming IONIQ yet to be unveiled.\n\nHyundai and Kia show South Korean automakers have what it takes for the EV race.\n\nHyundai started off 2024 on a good note or more precisely, with a record start. In May, it sold more than 17,000 EVs across the globe. In the U.S., it is even challenging the EV king, Tesla. In May, Hyundai Motor Group that includes Kia, made 11.2% of the EV market in the U.S. By hitting double digits in market share, Hyundai and Kia are getting closer to close the gap with Tesla.\u00a0While Tesla led by 52.9%\u00a0last year, the gap fell to\u00a040.5% through May\u00a0this year as Hyundai continues to grow its\u00a0market share. Although the fall of Tesla and its market share was bound to happen at some point, figures show that Hyundai and Kia are doing something right with their EV offerings and strategies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are at the forefront of innovation in transportation. Unlike gas-fueled cars, they can cause less harm to the planet while oftentimes being cheaper due to subsidies. Looking at the industry\u2019s current and expected growth, it is clear that EVs are here to stay. Just by 2030, a short six years from now, 50% of cars sold in the U.S. will likely be EVs, and the industry is expected to grow at a compounding annual growth rate of around 18% up until 2030, representing a huge upside. In order to be a part of the revolution that EVs will cause, below are the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) has been one of the leaders in the automobile industry, and it is now investing heavily in the electric vehicle market. Last year, GM sold 75,000 electric vehicles. While the sales came largely short of its initial 150,000 EV goals, GM still plans to delve aggressively into the EV segment. By 2025, GM will have spent over 35 billion in EV and AV investments, a 75% increase from its pre-COVID plan.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of GM\u2019s electric vehicle sales is its retail partnership. For instance, GM has an Auto Program with Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which makes it easier for GM to reach consumers and amass sales. Costco members would get a special discount when purchasing GM electric vehicles, and considering that there are more than 50 million active Costco members in the U.S., the partnership opens a market expansion opportunity for GM.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.80x, GM offers an excellent investment opportunity for those looking for undervalued EV stocks.\n\nXpeng\u00a0(XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nXpeng (NYSE:XPEV) is a Chinese EV company that started in Guangzhou, China. Although this Chinese EV startup is a relatively small player in the market, it has one of the greater growth potentials among numerous EV makers. Even though the stock has been performing poorly this year, Xpeng has promising news on both financial and nonfinancial ends that will convince investors the stock will bounce back.\n\nOne of the main strategies Xpeng will implement in the near future is its shift into more affordable and mass-market models instead of current models targeting the high-end EV market. The company also announced it will launch more than 10 new models in the next 3 years.\n\nFinancially, Xpeng is a buy. With gross margins of 13%, there is hope of them eventually reaching profitability. Many EV companies have negative gross margins, leading to large negative net margins \u2014 though Xpeng\u2019s 13% is a positive sign. Its revenue is also up a massive 62% year-over-year, showing the company is not slowing down and still has significant upside left. As its growth continues, margins will improve, and so will the conditions of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is currently the largest EV company in the world, even bigger than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), owning an 18% market share of the entire industry. BYD\u2019s business model is a success story that has propelled the company to its current position. Through the use of vertical integration, the company profits from multiple aspects of EVs, providing its own batteries, and even its own computer chips. Through large investments in innovation, BYD is trying to keep the top EV spot. One recent project was an investment of $1.4 billion that guarantees the production of 720,000 power device products and 6 billion optical microelectronic products.\n\nAfter taking a look at the financials, BYD is clearly a buy. The company is growing at a very rapid rate. In just one of the quarters last fiscal year, the company experienced year-over-year growth of 67%, showing massive potential for continued expansion. BYD is also profitable, which makes growing easier as profits can be reinvested to give the company an edge. Many EV companies are unprofitable, though this one can still consistently keep its net profit margin in the black.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Penny Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Penny stocks to buy now are notorious for their high risk, often characterized by low trading volumes, minimal pricing and precarious fundamental and financial standings. These factors combine to make their price movements more volatile than those of larger-cap cousins. However, for the discerning investor, penny stocks can offer a path to massive returns on a comparatively slim initial investment.\n\nIf you\u2019re building out a penny stock portfolio, remember to consider a company\u2019s operational prospects and enduring viability carefully. Though many penny stocks to buy now have inherently speculative value propositions, it\u2019s important to steer clear of potential \u201cpump and dump\u201d traps by thoroughly evaluating the practicality and market demand for a company\u2019s products and its capacity for sustained growth.\n\nWhile certainly speculative, these three penny stocks to buy now have operational prospects that outweigh their shakier standing and lessened liquidity. Better yet, they\u2019re priced to buy, and offer an opportunity to 10x your investment if the stars align in their favor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDesktop Metal (DM) 3d printer printing chips, 3D printing stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Alex_Traksel\n\nA reverse split is rarely a bullish indicator, but in the case of 3D printing stock Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM), it may be the opening move for an imminent resurgence. The company executed a 1-for-10 reverse split at the beginning of June, and since then, prospects have improved considerably, as per-share pricing popped 32% this week alone. However, a range of bullish news items may be the wind that fully lifts Desktop Metal from its long-term slump.\n\nMost notably, Desktop Metal recently added platinum 3D printing to its jewelry production offerings in conjunction with metals science production firm Legor Alloys. Platinum printing, in particular, was a tough nut to crack because of the metal\u2019s \u201chigh hardness and melting point,\u201d but the new tech developments promise to allow \u201call-new, once-impossible designs.\u201d Desktop Metal will show off the new opportunities later this month at a 3D printing industry event, so keep a close eye on the stock in the meantime.\n\nThe Metals Company (TMC) A photograph of the ocean.\n\nSource: Manu Galdamez/ShutterStock.com\n\nIn late April, I looked at The Metals Company\u2019s (NASDAQ:TMC) potential among penny stocks to buy now, highlighting the addition of Steve Jurvetson, known for his involvement with SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), to their board. I also looked at the company\u2019s high burn rate as a potential hurdle since deep-sea metals mining requires huge upfront capital with long exploratory and development timelines before generating revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround. In late May, The Metals Company announced a breakthrough in their operations \u2014 the first successful extraction of battery-grade nickel from deep-sea sources. Independent third-party evaluations confirmed that the nickel extracted from the Pacific Ocean could be processed into nickel sulfate, a top battery manufacturing component.\n\nCompany forecasts indicate that their undersea resources could potentially fulfill the material needs of up to 280 million electric vehicles, equivalent to the current number of vehicles on U.S. roads. Analysts predict a break-even point by next year or 2026. That positions The Metals Company as a compelling near-term investment among penny stocks to buy now and negates much of the concern around the cash flow I previously highlighted.\n\niRobot (IRBT) IRBT short-squeeze stocks\n\nAlthough iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) doesn\u2019t strictly fall into penny stock classification with its per-share pricing around $9, its modest $270 million market cap positions it alongside smaller companies like Desktop Metal and The Metals Company. And, like the other two penny stocks to buy now, iRobot has plenty of latent upside potential that may send the stock surging. Already, iRobot is emerging as a potential standout comeback story this year, poised to generate strong momentum in the robotics sector irrespective of broader market trends.\n\nInterest in iRobot spiked early in the year amid Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) attempted (and failed) acquisition, largely motivated by iRobot\u2019s extensive patent portfolio and innovative technology despite a slowdown in robotic vacuum sales. This justification underscores the ongoing renaissance in robotics, spotlighting iRobot as a primary player in developing advanced robotics and sensing tech, even if the end product (vacuums) aren\u2019t top sellers. Instead, iRobot\u2019s strength lies in its patent portfolio, as evidenced by its $174 million intangible assets balance.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Bill Gates wants to 'fix the cows' \u2014 here's the startup he backed to help fight climate change\n\nOn the front lines of combating climate change, one innovative startup is making significant strides in reducing methane emissions from livestock.\n\nThe company is called Rumin8, which develops feed supplements that reduce methane emissions produced by cows through their digestive processes, including burping and flatulence.\n\nRumin8 made headlines in 2023 after raising $12 million in a funding round led by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures.\n\nDon't miss\n\nBeating the market is no myth: These expert stock-pickers' recent success could help you build generational wealth 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nIn a 2023 interview with the think tank Lowy Institute, Gates pointed out that there are two paths of solving the emission issue of cows, who \u201cburp and fart methane to an extreme degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can either fix the cows to stop them doing that or you can make beef without the cow. Both of those will be pursued to see which one can lead to the best product in terms of taste, health and cost,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock activities contribute to approximately 14.5% of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions, with cattle alone accounting for two-thirds of this total.\n\nRumin8's solution looks promising. A controlled study run by Rumin8 and University of New England found an impressive 81% reduction in methane emissions when cattle had access to water troughs treated with the tech company's methane-reducing supplements.\n\nWhile Rumin8 remains a privately held company, making it inaccessible to everyday investors, there are multiple avenues to safeguard our planet beyond reducing methane emissions from cows. Many publicly traded companies have taken significant steps towards combating climate change. Here's a look at three green stocks actively engaged in tackling this crucial issue.\n\nTesla\n\nA typical passenger vehicle emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA also reported that in 2022, direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector contributed to 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThat\u2019s why many consider Tesla (TSLA) to be a top green stock \u2014 the company helps resolve the issue through the production of electric vehicles (EVs) that produce no tailpipe emissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: \u2018You didn\u2019t want to risk it\u2019: 80-year-old woman from South Carolina is looking for the safest place for her family\u2019s $250,000 savings. Dave Ramsey responds\n\nThe company has been at the forefront of the EV transition. In 2023, it delivered 1.81 million EVs, beating Wall Street's expectations and marking a 38% increase from 2022.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, however, Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries fell 8.5% year over year to 386,810. The company said this \"decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.\"\n\nTesla shares are down 26% year to date, but Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas sees a comeback on the horizon. Jonas has an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on Tesla with a price target of $310 \u2014 around 68% above the current levels.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners\n\nWhile EVs are gaining popularity, it\u2019s important to recognize that electricity doesn't appear magically in every wall outlet.\n\nAccording to the EPA, electricity production is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, comprising 25% of the U.S. total in 2022. The agency highlighted that for that year, \u201c60% of our electricity comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and natural gas.\u201d\n\nFortunately, alternatives exist.\n\nEnter Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), renowned for operating one of the world's largest renewable power platforms. Their portfolio includes hydroelectric, wind, utility-scale solar and storage facilities across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. With an operational capacity nearing 34,000 megawatts and a development pipeline of approximately 157,000 megawatts, Brookfield is one of the leaders in sustainable energy solutions.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners\u2019 partnership units are dual listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, so it\u2019s easy for both Canadian and American investors to get a piece of the action.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Jonathan Reeder has an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on Brookfield Renewable Partners and a price target of $32, implying a potential upside of 29%.\n\nFirst Solar\n\nAccording to the United Nations, solar energy is recognized as \u201cone of the least carbon-intensive means of electricity generation.\u201d In particular, solar power produces no emissions during the generation process, and \u201clife-cycle assessments clearly demonstrate that it has a smaller carbon footprint from \u2018cradle-to-grave\u2019 than fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nFor those interested in investing in this segment, check out First Solar (FSLR), one of the world's largest manufacturers of photovoltaic solar panels.\n\nFirst Solar\u2019s thin-film solar module technology stands out for its efficiency and environmental advantages over traditional silicon-based panels. The company's commitment to sustainability extends beyond its products to its operational practices, emphasizing resource efficiency and responsible manufacturing.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, First Solar reported net sales of $794 million, with management anticipating full-year net sales between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion.\n\nShares have already climbed 50% year to date. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch has an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on First Solar and a price target of $325, suggesting a further upside of 25%.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe broadening of the stock market rally hasn\u2019t yet arrived as investors keep piling into (just about) anything AI touches.\n\nElon Musk revealed earlier this week that Super Micro (SMCI) will provide hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building. That triggered a pop in the stock.\n\nWhen Dell's (DELL) CEO said his company would be building an \"AI factory\" for Musk's xAI in partnership with AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA), its shares also rose.\n\nAnd though the jumps in both names were short-lived, their performance this year and the response to Musk's one-word post are reminders that what he says matters to a lot of people and that anything related to AI will push markets around.\n\nSo far this year, SMCI is up over 200%. Dell, which to some harkens back to a PC 1.0 world, has seen its stock nearly double.\n\nIt doesn't take a contrived plan or a sideways approach to profit from Wall Street's excitement around AI technology. The main driver of 2024's seemingly unstoppable run is the earnings potential of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, and the platform giants.\n\nCiti analysts, who earlier this week upped their S&P 500 year-end target to 5,600, observed that more than two-thirds of the stock market\u2019s gains so far have flowed from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd adding Elon to the mix certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nThe Super Micro news has a clear Musk dimension, and part of the multi-CEO\u2019s dynamism is that his businesses cross into different industries and are themselves interconnected. But since Tesla is the only public Musk company, most investors can only get in on his other ventures indirectly. If you can\u2019t buy into xAI, why not acquire a piece of its suppliers? Elon Musk attends 'Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk' session during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three on June 19, 2024, in Cannes, France. (Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) (Marc Piasecki via Getty Images)\n\nA similar dynamic is at play within the world of AI.\n\nThe AI rally extends beyond hardware manufacturers too. Investors attempting to create a makeshift Musk basket of related tech holdings are doing the same thing with Nvidia. Because it's not just the Big Tech platforms churning out apps and productivity software that are drafting off AI exuberance. There's an entire ecosystem out there.\n\nPowering the computer systems that train and run AI systems requires huge amounts of energy. Utility companies are catching a ride on the AI wave.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, which will include building and running data centers. In turn, power demand from US data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, in part because of AI, according to estimates from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nStory continues\n\nGetting in early is nice. But the AI frenzy is proving that getting in at all is more than enough. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "3 Top Stock Picks to Invest in the World\u2019s Most Creative Companies",
        "content": "In March, GQ released its list of the 20 most creative companies worldwide. I\u2019m going to turn those into top stock picks for the second half of 2024 and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re showcasing the companies around the world that are leveraging creativity in order to drive business and make the world a better place. What do we mean by creativity? Ingenuity. Innovation. Originality. Fearlessness,\u201d GQ\u2019s Alex Hoyt and Jaimie Ding wrote on March 27.\n\nOf the companies on the list, I believe 11 of them are listed on a stock exchange in the U.S. or elsewhere.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe names on the list I won\u2019t recommend include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Prada (OTCMKTS:PRDSY), Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That\u2019s three from Magnificent Seven and two other popular consumer brands.\n\nThe three names that I\u2019m going with are great creators, but also brilliant business operators, whose shares will go up more often than down over the long haul.\n\nNew York Times Co. (NYT) A photo of a person reading the Feb. 16, 2020 issue of the New York Times.\n\nSource: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving worked in the publishing industry for over a decade, I marvel at how the New York Times Co. (NYSE:NYT) has managed to survive \u2014 and even thrive \u2014 while so many news outlets have gone belly up.\n\n\u201cWe think the Times should be the essential subscription for every curious English-speaking person around the world,\u201d NYT Chief product officer Alex Hardiman told GQ.\n\nFull disclosure: I subscribe to the Times. While it\u2019s primarily for my work endeavors, I do enjoy all the arts and leisure coverage, and we can\u2019t forget the puzzles. But most importantly, as Hoyt and Ding wrote, it earns over $2 billion from its 10 million customers.\n\nHowever, beyond some headline numbers, I know very little about the company founded by Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones in 1851. In 1896, Adolph S. Ochs acquired the paper for $75,000.\n\nHe and his grandson, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who was publisher for nearly 30 years, from 1963 to 1992, made the paper the respected publication it is today.\n\nDue to the dual-class share structure, the company is controlled by the Ochs-Sulzerger Trust.\n\nImportantly, its adjusted operating profit margin in Q1 2024 was 12.8%, 320 basis points higher than a year ago.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is one of my favorite companies, primarily because of its Hoka performance running shoes, not its UGG brand shoes.\n\nIn August 2022, I suggested that Deckers ought to split its stock to increase its liquidity and share count. At the time, it traded around $326. It\u2019s now trading nearly $1,000. When Hoka was acquired in 2013, management thought the brand\u2019s revenues might be able to hit $100 million some day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late May, it reported Q4 2024 results. Hoka\u2019s revenues in the fourth quarter alone were $533 million. For the entire year they were $1.81 billion, 18x the company\u2019s goal a decade ago.\n\n\u201cNow, in addition to winning over athletes (Hoka is the official shoe of Ironman Triathlons), the brand is hot with the fashion set\u2014they\u2019re doling out buzzy collabs with streetwear darlings Brain Dead and lining the shelves of boutiques like Nepenthes in New York and The Broken Arm in Paris,\u201d GQ reported.\n\nIf Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) can do a 10-for-1 split, Deckers should too. It\u2019s a keeper.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBernard Arnault \u2014 the CEO of LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) and the world\u2019s third-wealthiest person with a net worth of $199 billion \u2014 took a big risk in 1984, buying Christian Dior\u2019s bankrupt parent, Boussac, for $60 million. $15 million of that came from his family\u2019s construction business, and $45 million from Lazard Fr\u00e8res, a French financial institution.\n\nHe then went and cut 9,000 workers from the payroll, sold off non-core businesses for $500 million, and made Dior the foundation of his luxury empire.\n\n\u201cIn the 90s, I had the idea of a luxury group and at the time I was very much criticized for it. I remember people telling me it doesn\u2019t make sense to put together so many brands. And it was a success \u2026 And for the last 10 years now, every competitor is trying to imitate, which is very rewarding for us. I think they are not successful but they try,\u201d Arnault told CNBC in 2018.\n\nAs GQ points out, LVMH has moved beyond luxury fashion into luxury experiences such as its work with Accor (OTCMKTS:ACCYY) to build the Orient Express brand, which will include future hotels, trains and sailing ships.\n\nLVMH currently offers luxury experiences and hospitality through its Belmond brand, which it acquired for $3.2 billion, including the assumption of debt, in 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Wedbush analysts believe the upcoming \"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) AI Day\" on August 8th will be a pivotal moment for the company, potentially propelling its stock towards a $1 trillion market cap. The firm maintained an Outperform rating and $275 price target on Tesla stock.\n\n\"We believe the August 8th robotaxi day will be a key historical moment for the Tesla story that we see as a near-term catalyst,\" Wedbush states in a recent note. This optimism stems from recent developments, including the company's progress on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the upcoming unveiling of its first robotaxi.\n\nWedbush highlights CEO Elon Musk's \"strategic vision with FSD and Optimus\" as a key factor in Tesla's future success. They see the recent FSD v12.4 update and the beginning of FSD testing in China as positive signs. Their bull case valuation of $350 per share hinges on Tesla achieving success with FSD and autonomous driving.\n\nThe August 8th event is expected to be a major reveal, finally bringing Tesla's long-discussed robotaxi concept to fruition. \"As part of Tesla's long-driven full self-drive thesis,\" Wedbush explains, \"it is now official that robotaxis will become a part of the Tesla portfolio.\"\n\nWedbush acknowledges some ongoing challenges, like short-term demand fluctuations, particularly in China.\n\nHowever, they see signs of stabilization and believe that with China on board, a global demand rebound is possible. They emphasize the importance of the second half of 2024 for Tesla's turnaround, with much hinging on strong execution by Musk and his team.\n\nOverall, Wedbush views Tesla as a company with a compelling risk/reward profile. With the August 8th Robotaxi Day and a potential demand rebound on the horizon, they believe Tesla has positive catalysts ahead.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAugust 8 robotaxi day 'a key historical moment for the Tesla story'\n\nPalantir stock downgraded to Sell at Monness Crespi; shares drop\n\nCarlyle pushing ahead with sale of Italian fashion brand Twinset, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Rivian a Millionaire-Maker Stock?",
        "content": "There's no way to hide the plain facts: Rivian(NASDAQ: RIVN) management sees 2024 as a key turning point for the business. But if it doesn't achieve the operational goals it has set for itself, the future could be rougher than expected. On the flip side, if Rivian does hit its audacious goals, this electric vehicle maker's stock could quickly become very popular -- and could help to make you a millionaire.\n\nRivian is going head-to-head with some big automakers\n\nWhen you think of electric vehicles (EVs), the first name that probably pops into your mind is Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). That makes complete sense since Elon Musk's company managed what can only be described as a coup in the auto sector. Not only did it build a profitable car company from the ground up, it did so with a technology that the major auto companies didn't think was viable. That success attracted a lot of imitators, one of which is Rivian. Image source: Rivian.\n\nBut Rivian is building itself upon a slightly different foundation. Tesla started off with a high-cost sports car. Rivian has started off with a high-cost pickup truck. That truck has been well received by consumers, and has won numerous design and quality awards. There's just one problem. Rivian loses money on every truck it sells.\u00a0The numbers are not pretty, with a loss of more than $38,000 per vehicle delivered in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCompany management knows this is a problem. But up until 2024, its focus had been on manufacturing trucks at volume. It achieved that in 2023, when it produced more than 57,000 vehicles, so it has proven it can operate at scale. In 2024, the goal is to prove that it can operate at scale and make money doing so. The company's future pretty much depends on it succeeding.\n\nRivian just revamped its production facility\n\nThe first step in the process was actually to stop increasing its production rate and focus instead on improving its production processes. In fact, its per vehicle loss in the first quarter included more than $9,000 \"primarily related to various supplier and other costs incurred in advance of the new technology changes and parts integration into the R1 platform as part of its cost of revenue efficiency initiatives.\" That's a mouthful of corporate jargon, but what it means is Rivian switched to cheaper suppliers, improved its products to increase their desirability, and, at the same time, increased its capacity to produce vehicles by a whopping 30%.\n\nThe next few quarters will reveal important information for investors. Rivian is aiming to achieve a positive gross profit in the fourth quarter. It will still lose money in 2024, though, and even if it manages to achieve a full-year gross profit in 2025, other expenses (like R&D and selling, general, and administrative costs) could keep it from achieving absolute profitability. But getting to gross profitability would be an important step.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next big achievement will be the company finally offering trucks for less affluent buyers. Right now, Rivian's trucks are expensive, which is fine, but materially limits the company's addressable market. It really needs to follow Tesla's lead and start offering some mass-market models. On that front, it plans to launch its lower-cost R2 truck in the first half of 2026. There are other models in the works, as well. But the real story is that once it proves it can profitably make an EV, its next big goal will be profitably making EVs for the masses. RIVN Chart\n\nCould Rivian be a millionaire-maker stock?\n\nSo far, Rivian has not been a great stock to own. The shares have fallen by more than 90% from their highest point. That's a clear sign that investing in the stock comes with material risks, and that only the most aggressive and risk-tolerant investors should consider buying it.\n\nHowever, the company has been executing well on its internal operational targets. And if the massive stock price gains Tesla witnessed as it inched its way toward profitability are any indication, there could be a huge upside for Rivian's shares as it traverses the same path. The risk, of course, is that Rivian could stall out before it achieves Tesla-like success.\n\nInvesting in Rivian could help more aggressive investors build seven-figure portfolios, but the risk/reward balance still looks tilted toward the risk side of the equation. If you do jump aboard, don't back up the truck until management has ticked a few more items off its to-do list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Rivian Automotive wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Barclays has issued a cautious outlook on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), maintaining an Equal-Weight rating and a price target of $180 on the stock in a note Friday.\n\nThe key reasons for this stance revolve around anticipated weak delivery numbers and ongoing fundamental challenges.\n\nBarclays estimates Tesla's 2Q24 deliveries to be around 415,000 units, which is significantly below the consensus estimate of 444,000. \"We estimate 2Q deliveries of ~415k units, below current consensus of 444k,\" the analysts noted, attributing this to weak sales in Europe and modest production increases in China.\n\nDespite a 7% sequential increase, this still implies a year-over-year volume decline of approximately 11%, marking Tesla's weakest-ever quarterly year-over-year volume result.\n\nThe firm also highlighted potential inventory issues. \"Production ~420k units, implying further inventory build,\" Barclays pointed out, expecting another modest inventory increase of about 5,000 units, which would raise global Tesla inventory to around 150,000 units.\n\nMoreover, Barclays sees further risks ahead for Tesla's earnings. \"2Q24 margins may see new trough; further negative EPS revisions ahead,\" the note stated. This comes after a sharp miss in 1Q24 deliveries, which were 387,000 units compared to expectations of 415,000-430,000 units.\n\nBarclays also indicated that while Tesla's strategic pivot toward autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence has captured market attention, a weak delivery result could refocus investor scrutiny on its challenging fundamentals.\n\n\"We believe Tesla is likely to face continued negative revisions on 2024 and '25 estimates,\" Barclays concluded, underscoring their cautious stance on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBarclays remains cautious on Tesla stock.

        "content": "In this article, we will talk about the Best Stock Research Platform for 2024. For our detailed discussion, go directly to the 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to building a strong portfolio, retail investors conduct a great deal of research to learn about the macroeconomic climate, read up on the most recent stock market trends, become familiar with investing strategies, and observe the most notable actions of smart investors and elite hedge funds. A sizable portion of the investing community consists of retail investors, and they have access to a wealth of online information that can assist them in navigating the volatile stock market. According to Gallup\u2019s survey, 162 million Americans, or 62% of adults in the United States, own shares in public companies. That is a 1% rise over 2023 and the highest percentage observed by Gallup since 2008. During the Great Recession, stock ownership declined and remained low for more than a decade, reaching lows of 52% in 2013 and 2016. Before 2008, the majority of Gallup surveys revealed that at least 60% of American adults owned stocks.\n\nToday, the stock market is very different from what existed at the time of the millennium. The internet has democratized information, resulting in increased\u00a0 stock market involvement, which has been accelerated during the pandemic. Wall Street welcomed retail investors for the first time as a result of the pandemic, even though the global outbreak is primarily remembered for the deadly virus and lockdowns. In apoll, 15% of American stock market participants stated they started investing in 2020. The study additionally shows that these new investors tended to be more optimistic about their prospects for success in the stock market. A study revealed that 19.5% of all stock market shares exchanged in the first half of 2020 were made by individual investors. That is about twice as many trades by ordinary investors as there were in 2010, and it represents an increase of 4.5% over 2019. This occurred during the meme stock mania in 2021, which saw prominent businesses skyrocketing on the stock market as retail investors banded together on social media and purchased the shares in bulk.\n\nNotwithstanding the attraction of potential profits, new research from eToro indicates that many retail investors in the United States appear to be more afraid of losing money than they are of missing out on the next great opportunity. Rethinking Risk, research by eToro, finds that while 31% of US retail investors are driven by the fear of missing out on the next great thing, 61% of investors indicate that their investment strategy is shaped by the fear of losing money through immoderate risk. Their behaviors, however, reveal a different tale, as many retail investors continue to invest in risky assets, with 70% holding single stocks and 41% holding crypto assets in their portfolios. Additionally, this research shows that 62% of people who began investing in the markets now feel better about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these developments, the demand for easily available, reliable information to aid retail investors in their decision-making is rising. According to a survey conducted by BNY Mellon and the World Economic Forum on global retail investment, three-quarters of current retail investors said they would trade more actively if they had more opportunities to learn about investing along with personalized, goal-oriented stock guidance. Here's where trustworthy websites for stock research would come in very handy.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of The Motley Fool's greatest growth companies to buy for the long term, as of May 13, with a projected 3-year sales growth CAGR of 39%. However, several Wall Street analysts have revised their 12-month price estimates for Tesla shares. Among them are analysts from JP Morgan, which maintained a \"sell\" rating with a $115 price target, noting the company's assessment that Robotaxi Tesla will likely not generate revenue for years. According to JPMorgan's Ryan Brinkman, the upcoming Robotaxi Tesla disclosure would not follow instant profitability, citing his recent discussion with Tesla's head of investor relations, who stated that the underlying vehicle platform will not be available soon.\n\nTesla's net income for Q1 was $1.1 billion on $21 billion in revenue, which is 9% less than the $23.3 billion it made at this time last year. Due to widespread price reductions and a decline in demand, the company's earnings, which were once the envy of the car industry, are at their lowest point in six years.\n\nBaron Partners Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the Fund\u2019s underperformance this quarter stemmed from the Fund\u2019s 10-year investment in Tesla, Inc. Tesla\u2019s shares fell 29.3% during the period and detracted 13.41% from the Fund\u2019s first quarter results. Although Tesla has contributed importantly to the Fund\u2019s performance since 2014, on occasion it has detracted from quarterly performance. In previous instances when Tesla shares have underperformed during a discrete period, they have shortly afterwards reflected the strong growth of the underlying business and the stock has appreciated considerably. We believe that will be the case again, although cannot guarantee it.\n\nA significant decline also occurred at the end of 2022. In that instance, investors had become concerned about a host of external factors. Investors believed the company founder, visionary, and CEO Elon Musk was distracted by his acquisition of Twitter. They also believed a weak Chinese economy emerging from COVID and U.S. government policies would curtail the purchases of Tesla vehicles. These fears proved to be overblown. As the company achieved milestones in the succeeding year, the stock subsequently doubled over the next 12 months\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s data, 74 hedge funds were bullish on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of 1Q FY2024, compared to 82 funds in the earlier quarter.

        "title": "A toddler was trapped in a Tesla after its battery died without warning amid record heat waves\u2014\u2019safety comes last\u2019 at Tesla, expert says",
        "content": "A 20-month year old girl in Arizona was recently locked inside a Tesla Model Y after the car's battery died, creating a \u201clife threatening situation\u201d in which firefighters had to break open the door with an ax to rescue her.\n\nRenee Sanchez, the girl\u2019s grandmother, loaded the girl into her car seat for a trip to the Phoenix Zoo. After she closed the rear door, though, Sanchez went around to the front of her car only to find the door wouldn\u2019t open: The car was dead.\n\n\u201cI could not get in. My phone key wouldn\u2019t open it. My card key wouldn\u2019t open it,\u201d she told local news network AZFamily.\n\nMichael Brooks, the executive director for nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, told Fortune that a toddler trapped in a car, in the Arizona heat, can become critically endangered in 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, many children die in hot cars.\n\nSanchez, faced with what Brooks called a \u201clife threatening\u201d situation, had no choice but to call 911. Scottsdale firefighters raced over, then grew frustrated once they saw the make of the car.\n\n\u201cThe first thing they said was, \u2018Uggh, it\u2019s a Tesla. We can\u2019t get in these cars,\u2019\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I don\u2019t care if you have to cut my car in half. Just get her out.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe firefighters broke through the window with an ax, climbed through the window, and pulled the toddler out of the car.\n\nWhile the girl was \u201cokay\u201d for the first few minutes, Sanchez said, she became very scared and started crying during the commotion. Her rescuers gave her a little fire hat to calm her down once she was out of the car.\n\nAfter she saw her granddaughter was fine, \u201cthen the anger\u201d came, Sanchez said. \u201cAll the thoughts of, oh my God, this could have been so much worse.\u201d\n\nHer 12-voltage battery\u2014responsible for powering the car\u2019s electric systems\u2014had died without warning. Teslas are supposed to have persistent warning signs when its 12-voltage battery is low, EV expert Mike Klimkosky said.\n\nThat the battery would simply turn off \u201cseems very odd,\u201d he added.\n\nA representative from the Tesla service department confirmed to Sanchez that she indeed received no warnings. Tesla did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment by press time.\n\n\u201cSafety comes last\u201d\n\nThere is a mechanism\u2013outlined in Tesla\u2019s online safety manual\u2013for drivers to unlock their cars when they are stuck outside, which was unbeknownst to Sanchez or the firefighters who came to rescue her granddaughter. It involves opening a three-inch circle near the front of the car called a toe cover, pulling out the cables within it, and connecting those cables to an external power supply (like a portable jump starter). That would allow the hood of the trunk to open, giving drivers access to the 12-voltage battery, which they could then jumpstart.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Klimkosky, who heads a nonprofit dedicated to teaching first responders EV safety, the responsibility lies with the firefighters for not knowing how to jump-start the Tesla. He claims the process would have been faster and easier than breaking through the car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the fire department to educate themselves,\u201d Klimkosky said. Tesla, and most other car manufacturers, have an emergency response guide on their websites available to first responders. The onus isn\u2019t on those manufacturers to continue educating firefighters, Klimkosky said.\n\nYet, he acknowledges that local fire departments don't have enough specialized training to deal with these incidents. That\u2019s why he started his nonprofit: to provide a resource for fire departments to get outside help, and \u201ctransition to the new world.\u201d\n\nBrooks, the executive director for Center for Auto Safety, thought it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to blame the firefighters for not knowing how to open the car.\n\n\u201cIt's not the firefighters\u2019 fault that Tesla chose electronic door latches that don't have proper emergency safeguards,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla has manual release doors for when you are inside the car and unable to get out, but they are unmarked, unlike seatbelts and airbags. Brooks said this was Tesla\u2019s choice to put \u201cform over function,\u201d that was ultimately \u201cunsafe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen there's not a federal standard that specifies how these vehicles are to be made, Tesla very rarely chooses routes that are safe,\u201d Brooks noted. \u201cThey're usually choosing something glitzy: safety comes last.\u201d\n\nBrooks added this incident contributed to an overall \u201cfailure in Tesla\u2019s safety culture.\u201d Earlier this year, Tesla had to recall almost 2.2 million cars in almost every model sold since 2012. Last year, Angela Chao, a shipping industry CEO and sister-in-law to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, died after she drove her Tesla into a lake and became trapped.\n\nYet, Klimkosky found it unfair to blame Tesla for a problem that all vehicles with electric-door release systems face. He said Tesla goes out of its way to make the toe cover clear and obvious for first responders.\n\nBut there are thousands of first responders, and at least 150 different types of vehicles; firefighters cannot be expected to memorize the safety procedure of each vehicle, Brooks said. Tesla should not hide their safety features for the sake of appearance.\n\nSanchez, for her part, sided with Brooks\u2019 camp, saying Tesla needed better emergency systems and more education for first responders. She was a prior fan of Tesla, but this episode has turned her off from the company.\n\n\u201cI give Tesla props. When it works, it\u2019s great. But when it doesn\u2019t, it can be deadly,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\n.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "EV Slowdown Might Be Undebatable But EV Innovation Is Unstoppable",
        "content": "EV Slowdown Might Be Undebatable But EV Innovation Is Unstoppable\n\nAt the beginning of June, Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN) announced the redesign of its\u00a0its all-electric R1 pickup and SUV models. By using Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips, Rivian improved the range, performance and computing power of its vehicles. Rivian already made history by bringing the world\u2019s first all-electric pickup to the road, beating even the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) whose long-anticipated Cybertruck came to life a while after. But, the EV concept continues to evolve as the automotive industry continues its all-electric transformation and EV makers need to evolve along with it.\n\nRivian revamped its R1S and R1T with the help of Nvidia.\n\nEveryone, especially traditional automakers like General Motors, (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), know very well that unlike internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs are more about software than hardware. But, Rivian even changed more than half the hardware components,\u00a0although\u00a0the 2025\u00a0models\u00a0do not outwardly look too different than the current\u00a0ones. Besides pushing the technical boundaries of its second-generation\u00a0products\u00a0further,Rivian\u00a0reengineered their batteries and electrical architectures,\u00a0known as the\u00a0brains of a vehicle, while adding\u00a0driver-assistant features\u00a0through the\u00a0new system\u00a0that\u00a0uses dual Nvidia DRIVE Orin processors. Like Tesla, Rivian also plans to launch a less-expensive EV, with the less expensive variation of R2 models expected to start at about\u00a0$45,000\u00a0upon their launch in the first half of 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, electric pickups are in for a treat this summer with the launch of the Alpha version of the world\u2019s first solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS. Made by\u00a0Worksport\u00ae Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP),together with a COR portable battery system, the power duo promises to extend the range of electric pickups and much more, considering the capability to offer off-grid power-on-the-go. Worksport just reported its best sales month ever,\u00a0achieving $739,417\u00a0in May, which alone is\u00a0332%\u00a0higher to the monthly average from the first quarter, whose overall sales of\u00a0$512,637 was also surpassed.\u00a0Worksport reported its sales surged due to\u00a0its Made-in-America portfolio whose\u00a0scaled production\u00a0kicked off in January. Worksport also recently received\u00a0the \u2018Innovator of the Year' award in Western New York\u00a0as its products promise to revolutionize the market, which is expected to translate to significant market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nDifficult times often bring out the greatest inventions.\n\nAs the saying goes, one can cut all the flowers one cannot stop Spring from coming. Same can be said for innovation that happens even during the most challenging times as this is when it is most needed.\u00a0The EV slowdown might in the air all year long, but Rivian getting the power of Nvidia and Worksport bringing in solar power to the table are examples that show the EV evolution is not showing any signs of stopping, as even unfavorable macroeconomic conditions cannot stop innovation.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The robots aren\u2019t coming. They\u2019re already here. From assembly lines and warehouse operations to surgical centers and home assistants, the robot revolution is in full-swing. But while regular people today are using robots to vacuum their homes and turn off their lights, a growing number of companies are pushing into the red hot field of robotics on a much larger scale. That makes now a great time to look at robotics stocks to buy.\n\nThere appears to be no slowing down the momentum behind robots, especially with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). Enthusiasts see the combination of robots and AI as the holy grail of technology that\u2019s likely to push us all into a world that looks a lot like the film \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d Revenue generated from robotics is forecast to reach nearly $170 billion by 2032, and the three companies on this list stand to benefit thanks to their innovation in the sector.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) has struggled mightily since going public in 2021. Over the past five years, the company\u2019s share price has fallen 85%. However, following a CEO change, there\u2019s hope that things might turnaround for this maker of robotic process automation software. UiPath co-founder Daniel Dines has stepped back into the CEO role after exiting last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNews that Dines is back at the helm of UiPath coincided with the company announcing better-than-expected financial results. For this year\u2019s first quarter, UiPath reported earnings per share (EPS) of 13 cents, which beat analysts\u2019 consensus forecasts of 12 cents. Revenue totaled $335 million, up 16% from a year earlier and better than the Wall Street estimate of $333 million. The encouraging earnings give hope that UiPath might be turning a page. Investors looking for the next up and coming robotics stocks to buy may want to consider PATH.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobots are apparently Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) new thing. That and supercomputers. During a recent annual shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk talked up the company\u2019s push into robotics, saying the the Optimus humanoid robot that\u2019s currently under development could make Tesla a $25 trillion company. Musk added that the move into robotics will help Tesla write an entirely new book for itself.\n\nTesla first revealed plans to develop humanoid robots in 2021. Earlier this year, the company released a video showing its Optimus robot folding laundry. At the shareholder meeting, Musk compared Tesla\u2019s humanoid robots to C-3PO from the movie \u201cStar Wars\u201d and said they will eventually cook, clean and do factory work for humans. Now might be an opportune time to take a position in TSLA stock with the share price down 34% over the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a medical technology company. It is involved in the development of cutting edge robotic-assisted surgery technologies, working in areas such as minimally invasive surgery and robotic-assisted spine procedures. Like the other names on this list, Medtronic\u2019s stock has struggled lately, having fallen 10% in the past 12 months. But here, too, there are signs of a turnaround underway that may make MDT a great opportunity for investors looking at robotics stocks to buy.\n\nThe company has managed to beat Wall Street expectations with its financial results. But conservative guidance has hurt the stock. Still, some analysts remain extremely bullish on MDT stock and praise the company\u2019s dividend. Medtronic pays a quarterly distribution of 70 cents per share, giving the stock a yield of 3.5%. The company recently raised its dividend for the 47th consecutive year, putting it in elite company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The extraordinary claims haven\u2019t panned out.\n\nNow that shareholders have approved the Tesla CEO\u2019s impressive pay package, investors are looking to the company\u2019s robotaxi unveiling in August.\n\nAnd although Tesla\u2019s focus on an autonomous fleet isn\u2019t new, what has changed since Musk started predicting autonomy is that the challenges of driverless technology have come into clearer view.\n\nOn the same day Tesla confirmed that its voting shareholders rallied behind Musk, Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG) Waymo issued a recall for its 672 driverless cars so that they would be less likely to crash into telephone poles.\n\nLast week, General Motors (GM) announced an additional $850 million investment in its autonomous subsidiary Cruise to help cover costs after its robotaxi service was halted when one of its driverless cars struck and dragged a pedestrian.\n\nDedicated autonomous car companies are still grinding away at fundamental problems. But Musk is still banking on an autonomous future for the world's most valuable carmaker.\n\nInvestors are waiting for Musk to share more details on the robotaxi plan during the upcoming unveiling on Aug. 8. But it would be a mistake to think that a lackluster showing would doom Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is set to reveal new details of the robotaxi on Aug. 8. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSimilar to prior events and investor calls, the particulars matter less than the story Musk can spin, the allegiance of his fandom, and the positive analyst reactions that adhere to a bull case thesis.\n\nIt almost doesn\u2019t matter what the August showcase reveals about the technological progress of the robotaxi initiative. Musk\u2019s insistence on positioning Tesla as a company moving beyond selling EVs is what\u2019s more important, second only to his ability to convince people to keep thinking so.\n\nMusk's AI Play\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Musk told investors at Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder event, referring to the EV market.\n\nIt isn't just Tesla that faces an EV pullback. Demand is cooling. And without hybrid or traditional gas-powered autos to fall back on, the company has to bear the full brunt of the slowdown.\n\nBut Musk, again, has turned to his deep well of grand promises to excite his base.\n\n\u201cWorking on the Tesla Master Plan 4. It will be epic,\u201d Musk said Monday on his social media platform X.\n\nStory continues\n\nA glance back at Tesla\u2019s three prior plans \u2014 which involved mass-producing EVs and setting up the foundation for global electrification \u2014 reveals a history of ambitious and even inspiring proposals.\n\nLike most Musk proclamations, of course, some of the details are yet to be borne out. For instance, a plan to \u201cenable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it,\u201d proposed in 2016, has yet to come to life.\n\nBut grasping for the stars only to reach the moon is its own victory. And Tesla\u2019s loyal backers, perhaps rightfully, point out that by setting \u201cstretch goals,\u201d Musk provoked the entire auto industry to aggressively pursue EVs, pulling society forward. Even if right now, Tesla\u2019s core EV business is under stress.\n\nAt Tesla's shareholder meeting this month, Musk also talked up the potential for Optimus, the company's humanoid robot, as its next big thing.\n\n\u201cI think Optimus is a 25-trillion-dollar market cap situation; it\u2019s an immense amount of work to get there, but we\u2019re moving very fast down that road,\u201d Musk said at the shareholder presentation.\n\n\u201cWe're not just starting a new chapter for Tesla; we're starting a new book,\u201d Musk said.\n\nNot the first time. And likely not the last.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Investing.com - In a strategy update released on Thursday, Morgan Stanley made significant alterations to its US Model Portfolio.\n\nThe changes include adding Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) due to its cyclical leverage to improving order rates in transportation end markets and potential secular tailwinds from power generation demand due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThey have also decided to remove QUALCOMM Inc (QCOM) as they believe the company's valuation effectively prices the underlying improvement in cyclical end markets and Edge AI opportunity.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! CLICK HERE to take advantage and accelerate your investments!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nCummins Inc (CMI) has been added to the portfolio for three main reasons. Firstly, CMI offers cyclical leverage from improvements in transportation end markets. Secondly, its exposure to the \"powering Gen AI\" theme provides secular growth tailwinds. Lastly, Morgan Stanley believes CMI trades at a reasonable valuation. As a large provider of power generation equipment, CMI is expected to benefit from increased content and structural demand tailwinds.\n\nMorgan Stanley is removing QUALCOMM Inc (QCOM) from its portfolio as they believe the company's valuation effectively prices the underlying improvement in cyclical end markets and Edge AI opportunity. Since its addition to the portfolio in March 2021, QCOM has gained 83%, outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark which was up by 46% over the same period.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Morgan Stanley has also made risk management-driven adjustments to its portfolio. It has increased its internally held portfolio weights in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), TransDigm Inc (TDG), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Becton Dickinson & Co (NYSE:BDX), and decreased its internally held portfolio weights in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMorgan Stanley adjusts its US Model Portfolio\n\nExclusive-Boeing nearing deal with supplier Spirit Aero after months of talks, sources say\n\nNvidia loses top spot to Microsoft after 3% drop\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Got $5,000? These 3 Growth Stocks Are on Sale Right Now",
        "content": "Don't let the S&P 500's soaring valuation and record levels convince you that all or even most stocks are expensive right now -- that's far from the case. There are some stocks trading at significantly reduced valuations which could make them enticing buys, especially if you're planning to hold on for the long haul.\n\nThree stocks which you can buy on sale today and that have promising growth prospects include Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP). Here's why investing $5,000 into these stocks can be a good move to make right now.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nElectric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla used to be a $1 trillion company. Today, its valuation sits at just under $600 billion. There are plenty of reasons to be bearish on the business -- its margins are shrinking, competition is intensifying, and the stock still isn't cheap, trading at more than 45 times its trailing earnings.\n\nBut there are also plenty of reasons to remain optimistic, too. Tesla is a big name in the EV market, which could position it for success amid the industry's growth despite cheaper options out there. The strong brand it has built up over the years could do for its higher-priced vehicles what Apple's brand has done for its premium-priced phones, which is to ensure that demand remains resilient even as competition increases.\n\nThere's also the potential for interest rates to come down within the next year. Under more favorable economic conditions, consumer demand may strengthen, leading to better results for Tesla.\n\nTesla's sales were down 9% for the first three months of 2024, totaling $21.3 billion. And while profits plunged by 55%, the company still posted a decent profit of $1.1 billion, which was a respectable 5% of revenue. It won't be an easy path by any means for Tesla, but with the stock down 27% this year, it could make for an intriguing option for contrarian investors.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nAn even worse-performing stock this year than Tesla is Snowflake. The data-storage stock has faced some unexpected adversity after CEO Frank Slootman announced his retirement earlier this year. Sridhar Ramaswamy, who previously worked at Alphabet-owned Google, has taken over, but investors have remained bearish on Snowflake's stock nonetheless.\n\nA change in CEO can ruffle some feathers as investors try to gauge what that might really mean for the business. But Snowflake remains a promising tech stock to buy. In its first-quarter results for fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, the company's revenue totaled $828.7 million and rose 33% year over year. And Snowflake expects up to 27% growth for the current quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more companies need data-storage solutions and artificial intelligence-related analysis, Snowflake can continue to benefit from high levels of demand. The one knock on the business is that it remains unprofitable, and that does pose a risk. But the company generates positive free cash flow, which is a good sign that it can continue to reinvest in its growth and long-term prospects.\n\nI believe investors overreacted to the CEO change earlier this year, and that can make Snowflake an underrated buy right now.\n\n3. Shopify\n\nShopify has been the best-performing stock on this list even though its shares are down 16% this year. The stock has been rallying recently as investors have likely started to realize the value it possesses, particularly in the long run and as economic conditions improve.\n\nIn the first three months of the year, Shopify reported revenue of $1.9 billion, which rose by 23% year over year. The company also posted an operating profit of $86 million, which was a significant improvement from its operating loss of $193 million in the prior-year period.\n\nBeing a big name in e-commerce, Shopify has firmly established itself as a top player in the industry. It has proven that it can compete even among a giant such as Amazon. Remarkably, the two companies have even partnered together, and Shopify merchants can offer a \"Buy with Prime\" option in their stores.\n\nAt less than $90 billion in market capitalization, Shopify is a stock which could get a whole lot bigger in the future. Investing in it now while it's on sale can be a great move for growth investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors can overlook underestimated stocks to buy for various reasons. In many cases, some inherent flaw or fundamental issue makes their underestimated status apparent.\n\nThose issues, in turn, prevent institutional and retail investors alike from stockpiling shares, no matter how cheaply they trade.\n\nBut when underestimated stocks are worth buying, they tend to be some of the market\u2019s top performers and can drive your overall portfolio\u2019s returns by a massive margin.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe best undervalued stocks to buy comprise mixed-cap stocks representing a blend of underestimated stocks. And, like other underestimated stocks, they could prove to be this year\u2019s big winner as we enter 2024\u2019s second half.\n\nRumble (RUM) In this photo illustration the Rumble logo seen displayed on a smartphone. RUM stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) is increasingly building its own ecosystem amid the wider tech backdrop that\u2019s setting this stock up to be a media success story, making it one of the undervalued stocks to buy now.\n\nThe company\u2019s monthly active user counts consistently sit above 40 million, which, while it pales in comparison to \u201ccore\u201d video platforms like Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, still represents a sufficiently \u201csticky\u201d audience that keeps coming back for more.\n\nThis helps prove the platform\u2019s long-term viability as it continues expanding its advertising ecosystem.\n\nRumble is making waves as its growing industry clout means that it can attract exclusive offerings with big-name creators, like last month\u2019s announced deal with the popular political show Breaking Points.\n\nBut, much like other big-name tech stocks, Rumble\u2019s pivot toward cloud services and data hosting may be the sales stream to push it over the edge.\n\nRecently, e-commerce and payments processing company PublicSquare (NYSE:PSQH) migrated its Marketplace platform hosting duties to Rumble \u2014 demonstrating that the underestimated stock is rapidly expanding beyond basic video hosting and media market opportunities.\n\nBuzzFeed (BZFD) Buzzfeed (BZFD) logo on a phone with a keyboard in the background. Buzzfeed layoffs\n\nSource: Meir Chaimowitz / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Rumble, BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) is another underestimated media stock. As activist shareholder activity ramps up, it may soon make headlines.\n\nThe company\u2019s underestimated status comes from a long history of scandals, including accusations of plagiarism, inappropriate advertiser influence, and a series of increasingly unpopular political stances that have alienated many customers and readers.\n\nThese issues, combined with the firm\u2019s slipping sales and limited profitability prospects, may have been what prompted former presidential candidate and activist investor Vivek Ramaswamy to acquire a 7.7% stake in BuzzFeed with plans to kick-start initiate substantial changes.\n\nStory continues\n\nRamaswamy is already engaging with Buzzfeed\u2019s board and management to explore numerous operational and strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including staff cuts and a potential shift in the company\u2019s editorial and business strategies.\n\nHis investment suggests a strategic move to address the lack of high-quality, independent media outlets and to advocate for greater transparency, objectivity, and quality in media content.\n\nDespite resistance from Buzzfeed\u2019s current management, Ramaswamy\u2019s Strive Asset Management is making its mark as a powerful player in activist investing, potentially setting its sights on further media company investments.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) upwork (UPWK) logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome odd things are happening with Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) stock that, in my mind, signal big things ahead for the remote work and freelancing platform.\n\nOver the past month, Upwork introduced an almost shocking amount of new fees to their business model despite two consecutive profitable quarters. The new fees and costs rocked the community and, from an outside perspective, seemed strange in their execution.\n\nAfter all, rapid and sweeping changes of this nature make them inherently hard to analyze for effectiveness down the road, as delineating between which changes led to which outcomes are effectively impossible.\n\nWhile this is pure speculation, it seems to me as if Upwork is rapidly positioning itself for a buyout bid of some sort, considering these fees may have negative effects on the platform in the long run but could boost valuation metrics in the short run if management is looking for a merger or acquisition.\n\nRumors swirled in 2019 that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was angling for a merger. Those rumors didn\u2019t pan out, obviously. Still, they point to historical precedent for Upwork signaling that it was interested in doing so.\n\nThe bottom line is that if the fees are simply a \u201cnew normal\u201d for Upwork, expect the stock to suffer as it increases client friction by forcing upfront costs across the enterprise (you wouldn\u2019t pay a car dealer to browse the inventory, to draw a rough comparison). But if these fees are a rapid bid to increase valuation multiples, this underestimated stock could be 2024\u2019s big winner.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration, the Tilray Brands (TLRY) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands\u2019 (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock has dipped nearly 25% below its January pricing, yet it remains a standout among cannabis stocks to buy.\n\nA key aspect of Tilray that many investors may not fully appreciate is its burgeoning craft beer business. Since acquiring brands from Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) in 2023, Tilray\u2019s alcohol sales have doubled, providing crucial sales diversification within the competitive cannabis market.\n\nThe potential of the craft beer sector is significant and often underestimated beyond simply its broad sales opportunities.\n\nAs broader recreational cannabis legalization continues to move through national bureaucratic systems, Tilray is uniquely positioned with an established network for production, distribution, and operations.\n\nThis infrastructure could be pivotal to national cannabis product distribution and offer Tilray a substantial competitive edge.\n\nCurrently, Tilray is seeking an additional $250 million to finance strategic acquisitions and expand its business areas.\n\nWhile this funding initiative will dilute existing shares, it presents an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors aiming to leverage potential gains among underestimated stocks in the cannabis sector.\n\nStem (STEM) Businessperson Shaking Hand With Digital Partner Over Futuristic Background, MnM stocks replacing the Magnificent 7.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSustainable energy stock Stem (NYSE:STEM) bridges two emergent sectors \u2014 sustainable energy and artificial intelligence.\n\nStem\u2019s software, Athena, acts as a sophisticated control system managing the interplay between generators, grid power, solar farms, and battery storage.\n\nIts AI-driven system autonomously optimizes energy distribution based on various factors like weather and energy prices, positioning it as an essential tool for enterprise clients managing sustainable energy solutions.\n\nThough currently considered a penny stock, Stem is poised for significant growth. The company\u2019s growth trajectory may end up similar to formerly speculative AI stocks like Palantir (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nThe company outlines this ambition in its \u201cAI and the Future of Energy\u201d white paper, which details a strategic plan to harness AI to enhance efficiencies across the sustainable energy sector.\n\nLike many emerging and underestimated stocks in the renewable energy field, Stem faces challenges in achieving profitability and deals with the inherent volatility of cyclical sales.\n\nNevertheless, the company has progressed past its initial phases and now boasts a growing stack of completed and ongoing projects.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nI hit Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) history as an underestimated stock up top, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its current underestimated status, especially following the recent shareholder vote to approve Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package and the decision to relocate operations from Delaware to Texas.\n\nDespite these significant corporate moves, Tesla\u2019s stock price has not surged as some might have expected and continues to trade below its six-month highs.\n\nTesla\u2019s long-term upside opportunities are well-documented. Numerous analysts, including ARK Invest, offer detailed projections of Tesla\u2019s market prospects and unique positioning.\n\nHowever, the most notable recent development for Tesla is the shareholder vote, which represents a significant event in corporate law.\n\nThis shareholder approval not only supports Tesla\u2019s strategic management decisions but also underscores the importance of maintaining corporate governance without interference from the judiciary, which had criticized the pay package as excessively large.\n\nThis situation highlights the broader implications of external interference in corporate governance, which can introduce risk and uncertainty that may undermine investor confidence in U.S.-based companies.\n\nTesla\u2019s overcoming of these challenges, coupled with its continued innovation and market leadership, solidifies its status as one of the best underestimated stocks to buy now.\n\nAcuity Brands (AYI) An image of multiple light bulbs hanging\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvesting in Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is a bright decision for those seeking stable, long-term investments in overlooked and underestimated sectors.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest lighting companies, Acuity offers a wide array of products ranging from DIY bathroom fixtures to sophisticated streetlight systems for cities.\n\nOver the past two decades, Acuity has strategically expanded its market presence through the acquisition of smaller companies.\n\nSince 2010, Acuity has demonstrated a strong performance track record, maintaining a nearly 10% compounded annual growth rate in earnings, showcasing the company\u2019s resilience in fluctuating markets.\n\nCEO Neil Ashe reinforced this point during the first-quarter earnings call by stating, \u201cWe increased our adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated significant free cash flow, and we allocated capital effectively to drive value.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Acuity Brands stands out as a robust and reliable option to anchor a long-term portfolio, especially considering its underestimated stock status.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in UPWK.

        "content": "The GMO U.S. Quality ETF (NYSEARCA:QLTY) seeks quality stocks to buy.\n\nAt the end of May, Barron\u2019s published an article about investing guru Jeremy Grantham\u2019s new ETF and how it\u2019s beating the markets despite not owningNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n\u201cThe GMO U.S. Quality ETF\u2019s disciplined approach uses both quantitative and fundamental techniques to assess the relative quality and valuation of U.S.-domiciled companies and aims to exploit a long-term investment horizon while withstanding short-term volatility in an actively managed ETF format,\u201d states the EYF\u2019s website.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, Grantham does not manage the fund. Tom Hancock, GMO\u2019s Head of Focused Equity, does this with portfolio managers Ty Cobb and Anthony Hene.\n\nHancock likens the latest AI craze to the dot-com froth of the late 1990s where stocks traded at nosebleed valuations. With Nvidia valued at twice the S&P 500 and Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) margins likely to fall, he steered clear of these two Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nLaunched last November, the ETF, which focuses on both growth and value, is up nearly 20% since its inception in line with the index.\n\nHere are three stocks to buy from QLTY\u2019s 35 holdings.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is QLTY\u2019s largest holding with a 7.4% weighting. It is the top Magnificent Seven holding. The other four weights range between 5.3% and 2.6%. Hancock considers Microsoft a cheaper way to play AI than Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft currently is valued at 14.1x sales and 30.4x cash flow. By comparison, Nvidia\u2019s P/S and P/CF ratios are 40.9x and 73.7x, respectively. There is no comparison.\n\nWhile I 100% believe in Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s AI plans, it\u2019s hard not to respect the job Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has done in the decade he\u2019s been in the top job. Since taking the helm in February 2014, its shares have appreciated 1,074%. That\u2019s pretty good for a company that was as large as MSFT was when he took over.\n\nOf the 58 analysts that cover MSFT stock, 55 rate it a Buy, with a $479.79 target price, 8% higher than its current share price.\n\nUp 32% over the past year, analysts are being conservative in their estimates. Through the first nine months of 2024, its operating cash flow is up 38% to $81.35 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s a cash flow machine.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) General Electric (GE stock) logo on headquarters building\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) is QLTY\u2019s 13th-largest holding at 2.9%.\n\nAlthough Larry Culp remains the CEO and the symbol is the same, GE Aerospace has little in common with the former industrial conglomerate. And that\u2019s good for shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the span of a week, no less than three well-respected publications ran articles about the company\u2019s success: Morningstar.com discussed how GE Aerospace has more focus now since splitting off its health care and energy businesses.\n\nBarron\u2019s talked about how Culp\u2019s decision to stay at GE and avoid a Boeing (NYSE:BA) turnaround was good news for investors. Lastly, Investor\u2019s Business Daily focused on GE Aerospace\u2019s healthy profitability and free cash flow growth.\n\nAt one time, GE paid an annual dividend of $1.24. It\u2019s now back to $0.24, with more to come.\n\n\u201cThe very long-term, profitable, and predictable nature of the jet engine service business is highly compatible with a generous dividend policy,\u201d stated Morningstar equity analyst Nicolas Owens on June 18.\n\nThere\u2019s no question Culp has earned the high praise he gets from analysts. Of the 19 that cover GE stock, 17 rate it a Buy, with a $180.04 target price, 9% higher than its current share price.\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS) momentum stocks: a smartphone screen displaying the Otis Worldwide (OTIS) logo\n\nSource: rafapress/shutterstock.com\n\nOtis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS) is the 24th-largest holding of QLTY with a 2.2% weighting.\n\nThe elevator company and its sister company, Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR), which specializes in heating and cooling systems, were spun off from United Technologies in April 2020. United Technologies then merged with Raytheon Technologies in an all-stock deal to form RTX (NYSE:RTX).\n\nOf the three stocks, CARR stock has done the best since the spinoff, up 415%. However, OTIS hasn\u2019t done too bad, gaining 114% over the past four years.\n\nIn December, I suggested that Otis would benefit from the ongoing global urbanization.\n\n\u201cAs cities grow and real estate goes more vertical rather than horizontal, elevators become vital to a building\u2019s success. That\u2019s Otis Worldwide\u2019s (NYSE:OTIS) bread and butter,\u201d I wrote.\n\nIn the latest quarter, while new equipment orders fell by 10.3%, its service business saw modernization orders rise by 12.9%, while its modernization backlog rose 15%. That\u2019s the beauty of its business: Even when real estate owners are slow to buy new equipment, the old equipment has to continue to function safely. It\u2019s not an expense they can avoid.\n\nIn 2024, it expects net sales of $14.65 billion at the midpoint of its guidance with organic sales growth of 4%. On the bottom line, it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.87, 9% higher year-over-year.\n\nIt trades at a reasonable 25x its EPS estimate for 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Electric Vehicle Stocks That Perform Better Than Their Fossil Fuel Counterparts",
        "content": "Believe it or not, electric vehicles do outperform their fossil fuel counterparts in some ways. From the perspective of sheer performance, that most obviously manifests as dramatically faster acceleration times. EV stocks to buy also outperform their fossil fuel counterparts in several important ways.\n\nI\u2019ll explain that in more depth throughout the article but it essentially all boils down to pricing. The average cost of an electric vehicle was greater than $55,000 in April 2024. The average\u00a0price for a new gasoline-powered vehicle was just below $45,000.\n\nHigher prices generally lead to higher margins, creating all kinds of strong business economics in the process. Although the price gap between EVs and gasoline-powered vehicles is narrowing, it is still significant, creating appreciable margins.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat simple fact is a strong reason to believe that the EV stocks to buy discussed below have a significant advantage over their\u00a0non-EV competitors.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is arguably one of the most maligned stocks best positioned to reward investors at the moment. Everyone is aware that Tesla is under substantial pressure to reduce its prices on its vehicles to become more competitive. That has caused a lot of fear around the EV industry in general.\n\n2023 was a year marked by tremendous slowdowns in EV sales activity overall. Tesla\u2019s revenues grew by more than 51% in 2022. Sales grew by less than 19% in 2023. 19% sales growth, as strong as it sounds, is still comparatively weaker.\n\nHowever, that still equates to overall gross margins above 18%. Those are well above margins at Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), and in line with those fromToyota (NYSE:TM).\n\nIn other words, Tesla performed as well as Toyota in 2023. That\u2019s hardly bad company to keep and still puts Tesla far ahead of the other big gasoline vehicle manufacturers. Those companies are also proving particularly poor at producing EVs, losing lots of money in the process.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) stock is entering a period of strength as it perfects its profitability recipe.\n\nThe company continues to mature and is recording margins above the 20% level. That puts its performance in that regard above Tesla. The other important thing to note is that BYD is actually the biggest producer of EVs globally. The company produced more than three million vehicles in 2023, beating Tesla for the second straight year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, BYD stands out as an EV stock to buy with a very strong combination of strong internal economics and incredible volume.\n\nThe result\u00a0is an opportunity for investors. EV stocks continue to be maligned in general. While the average investor sits around bickering about EVs and how gasoline vehicles are always better, consider BYD\u2019s unique advantages.\n\nThe company\u2019s already carved out a massive share of the market overall. BYD has a bright future ahead of it. And it\u2019s currently undervalued. Based on the factors that I just discussed, it\u2019s hard to find a better EV stock to buy anywhere.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is among the most competitive chip companies and chip stocks overall.\n\nCompetitiveness usually manifests as an ability to sell your products at higher prices than your competitors while keeping costs low. The result is high margins. ON Semiconductor certainly has high margins, better than roughly 81% of all publicly listed chipmakers.\n\nOne of the reasons ON Semiconductor has been so successful is that it has carved out a niche as a chip provider to the electric vehicle industry. The company is currently applying some of the technological know-how it developed in manufacturing those chips to the AI industry. The company believes it may be able to increase AI chip efficiency by utilizing its silicon carbide technology.\n\nIf so, it\u2019s logical to assume that ON Semiconductor\u2019s margins will rise even higher as a result of higher chip prices due to AI demand. Beyond all of those positives, it should also be noted that ON Semiconductor stock is highly regarded and has substantial potential above its current price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Just Put a $2,600 Price Target on Tesla. With the Stock Down 54% From Its Highs, Is Now the Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is not shy about making bold predictions especially when it comes to the top holding of her flagship Ark Innovation ETF.\n\nWood has a history of setting lofty targets for her favorite stock, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), which has had a difficult time recently, down 54% from its high in 2021 and about 25% lower on the year. This poor performance, meanwhile, has come while the S&P 500 has been hitting new all-time highs. Clearly, Tesla has not been along for the ride.\n\nLet's look at Wood's latest Tesla prediction and whether there is a realistic chance of the stock hitting her target price.\n\nNew Tesla price target\n\nEarlier this month, Wood set a $2,600 price target on Tesla to hit by 2029. She also listed a price target of $3,100 in a bullish scenario along with a bear case of $2,000.\n\nWood's case for her $2,600 price target largely revolves around Tesla's robotaxi business, which she predicts will account for 63% of Tesla's revenue and 86% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2029. She estimates only 26% of its revenue and 10% of its EBITDA will come from electric vehicles (EV). She models its stationary energy-storage business to be 10% of revenue and 3% of EBITDA, with insurance 1% of both revenue and EBITDA. Overall, she has the company producing $440 billion in EBITDA in 2029.\n\nWood assumes that Tesla will own and operate its own robotaxi fleet for the first one-to-three years it's introduced, while third-party companies will later own and maintain the vehicle fleet. Wood sees Tesla getting an 80% take rate from its fleet in 2029, with these third parties earning $0.20 per mile.\n\nWoods said her conviction that Tesla will launch a robotaxi network within the next five years has greatly strengthened. She said this will transform the company's business model \"from one-off vehicle sales to a recurring revenue base as every car becomes an AI-powered cash flow generation machine.\"\n\nThe portfolio manager said that Tesla's Optimus robot, which Musk has predicted could become the biggest part of Tesla, is not in her model currently and that a meaningful commercialization ramp likely won't happen in the next five years. She also does not see its supercharging network as having a meaningful impact in comparison to its robotaxi opportunity.\n\nWithout the robotaxi network, Wood said her price target would be $350. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Wood's price target realistic?\n\nLarge price targets on a stock are often a way to grab media and investor attention and may not always be grounded in realty. For Tesla to reach Wood's price target, the stock would have to increase 14 times in value over the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Wood did see Tesla hit a large prior target she set in 2018 when she predicted the stock would hit $4,000 (pre-splits) by 2023. She was looking for the stock to increase 12 times over that period, and it did in fact reach her target in 2021. Adjusted for a 5-to-1 split and a later 3-to-1 split, that $4,000 price would be around $267 post-split today, so the stock has fallen back since.\n\nAt the time of her 2018 call, Tesla was dealing with quality-control issues for its Model 3, while liquidity was also a concern. However, Wood was able to see through that, and the company's fortunes changed for the better. A later $7,000 price target ($467 post-splits) by 2024 made in 2020 looks less likely to happen.\n\nAt this point, Wood is trying to model out a robotaxi network, something that currently doesn't exist. No one knows what type of reception these self-driving vehicles will be met with by commuters, nor what type of regulations they may face in major cities. Also, if competition enters the market, it could quickly change the economic dynamics as well.\n\nAs such, Wood's Tesla target, while possible, is also improbable given the number of variables involved. That said, Tesla does not have to reach Wood's target to be a successful investment over the next five years. At this point, an investment in the company is very much an investment in Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his technology vision. If he can pull off a robotaxi network or if his Optimus robots eventually become the largest part of Tesla, then the stock could have a lot of room to run.\n\nAt the same time, it's always more risky to invest in business models and products that are not yet established, so investors should size any investments accordingly.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tesla right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tesla, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Tesla wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Tech stocks look set to drive Wall Street higher, with chipmaker Nvidia leading the way. The Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, yet the Swiss National Bank cuts rates again.\n\n1. Futures just higher with techs leading the way\n\nU.S. stock futures traded marginally higher Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way.\n\nBy 08:08 ET (13:08 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 6 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 22 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 140 points, or 0.7%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices are all on course for a winning week, with both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite reaching fresh records on Tuesday. The stock market was closed Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the way, becoming the most valuable company in the world earlier this week [see below], with enthusiasm towards all things AI driving the gains.\n\nThe economic data slate includes initial jobless claims figures and housing starts data later in the session, as investors look for more clues towards when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates.\n\n2. Bank of England set to hold rates unchanged\n\nThe Bank of England holds its latest policy meeting later Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged.\n\nU.K. inflation returned to its 2% target for the first time in nearly three years in May, data released on Wednesday showed, but wage growth and underlying pricing pressure remain a concern for the central bank.\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey opened the door early last month to a rate cut, saying he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\", but not quite yet.\n\nMost economists in a Reuters poll last week thought the central bank would start to cut rates in August, but markets see only a 30% chance of an August rate cut and think a first move is more likely in September or November.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Swiss National Bank trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, its second cut in a row.\n\nThe SNB surprised markets with a cut in March, with inflation remaining within the central bank's target of 0%-2%.\n\n3. Nvidia still in spotlight\n\nNvidia is likely to remain in the spotlight Thursday, after the chipmaker became the world\u2019s most valuable company earlier this week, as it has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of artificial intelligence.\n\nIt is now worth $3.34 trillion, having ended trading on Tuesday at nearly $136, making it more valuable than fellow tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), having overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Stifel lifted their price target for Nvidia's shares to $165 from $114, citing the company\u2019s longer-term growth prospects and profitability metrics.\n\n\"We expect the majority of near-to-medium term opportunities will come from high performance computing, hyperscale and cloud data center, and enterprise and edge computing,\" they argued. \"While we continue to view Nvidia\u2019s exposure to Gaming, Automotive and Professional Visualization favorably, the shift from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents the company\u2019s most significant revenue and profitability growth opportunity over the next several years.\"\n\nBut they noted several risks to the updated price target, including a \"potential digestion period following several quarters of significant investment\", unforeseen tightening of U.S. trade restrictions on technology shipped to China and \"general macro[economic] events.\"\n\n4. Tesla\u2019s EU sales slumped in May\n\nTesla\u2019s sales slumped in the European Union in May, falling 34.2%, as part of a sharp drop in demand for new battery-electric cars in the region.\n\nDemand for EVs in Europe has cooled in recent months, after rising strongly for several years, while competition to produce more affordable models has grown.\n\nTo shield domestic automakers from an influx of cheap EV imports, the European Commission said last week it would impose provisional duties of up to 38.1% on China-made EVs starting July.\n\nThis prompted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a U.S. electric carmaker, to state that it was likely to increase the price of its China-made Model 3 when the EU measures come into effect.\n\nTotal EV sales in the European Union dropped 12% in May from a year earlier, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association showed on Thursday.\n\nThis drop was led by a sharp 30% reduction in Germany, the bloc's largest electric vehicle market, after the country ended late last year subsidies for buying EVs.\n\n5. Crude awaits official US inventories\n\nCrude prices were stable Thursday, ahead of the release of the official U.S. inventory data.\n\nBy 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.1% lower at $80.61 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.1% to $85.18 per barrel.\n\nThere was no WTI settlement on Wednesday due to a U.S. holiday, which kept trading largely subdued.\n\nData released on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks rose by just over 2 million barrels in the week ended June 14, suggesting weakening demand even during the important summer driving season.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration releases the official figures later Thursday, a day later than usual due to Wednesday\u2019s Juneteenth holiday.\n\nThe continued unrest in the oil-rich Middle East has provided a degree of support for the market, with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz warning of a possible \"all out war\" with Lebanon's Hezbollah, even as his country continues to battle Hamas in Gaza.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBOE policy meeting, tech stocks, Tesla's EU sales - what's moving markets\n\nAnalysis-China's key plenum aims to fix decades-old tax revenue imbalance\n\nSwiss National Bank continues rate cuts, points to lower inflation\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) market is still amidst a general slump, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, where interest rates have remained elevated. This could all change very soon, and investors should be ready.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index (CPI) report for the month of May on Thursday of last week. The figures were surprising. The \u201ccore\u201d index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose only 0.2% from April, while the year-over-year (YOY) measure climbed 3.4%, its lowest in more than 3 years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis is positive data for U.S. equities broadly because the Federal Reserve will have more breathing room to cut rates. But within the report, there are some silver linings for the EV industry, in particular. The prices for new automotives declined in May as well the cost for car insurance, which had reached all-time highs in previous periods.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCooling inflation for new vehicles will ultimately help to create a better demand environment for new EVs, which will help lift the values of various EV stocks. Wall Street has a few favorites that it has been betting on, such as these three.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) was a prolific lithium battery manufacturer that has recently converted to an EV behemoth, defying all odds. The latter half of 2023 and the beginning of this year were studded with news about the eminent \u201cEV slump\u201d that would harm all manufacturers in the space as consumer demand continued to ebb. Tesla\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk also warned of slow growth in 2024. Yet Chinese EVs, including BYD, are reporting the opposite.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, BYD sales jumped 46% YOY to 301,631 new energy vehicles (NEVs). In China, BYD\u2019s home market, the EV maker\u2019s market share sat at around 32.9%. Robust YOY growth numbers broadly continued for the EV maker during the months of April and May. April saw BYD sell 313,245 NEVs, representing an increase of 48.9% from April 2023. Similarly, in May, BYD sold 331,817\u00a0NEVs, up 38.1% from the same month in the prior year.\n\nFurther, BYD\u2019s ongoing growth rates will depend largely upon demand capacity in China as well as the EV maker\u2019s success in emerging markets. The company has already a good foothold in Brazil and Thailand and plans for a debut in the Middle East as well as certain European nations.\n\nThus, BYD has garnered strong buy ratings from six Wall Street firms. And the overwhelming majority of the other 24 firms covering the stock have given it a buy rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is another Chinese EV that has defied sales odds in quarters as many of its American counterparts have continued to report a slowdown of sales and deliveries. In the first quarter, vehicle revenue increased 32.3% YOY to $3.4 billion. Moreover, the firm\u2019s delivery figure climbed 52.9% to 80,000 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nAlthough these growth figures are impressive, they do come at a cost. Li Auto and just about every other EV maker has engaged in an array of price cuts to entice consumers in the highly competitive market. That is to say, while top-line numbers remain robust, if you glance further down on the income statement, margins will look like they\u2019re compressing. For many EV makers, they are.\n\nStill, the growth of Li Auto is impressive, and Wall Street seems to be optimistic. Out of the 27 firms covering LI, 25 have given the stock either a strong buy or buy rating. In particular, eight have given LI shares a strong buy rating.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another EV stock that still has its fans on Wall Street despite ongoing turmoil hitting the EV maker\u2019s growth figures. The American EV maker reported its first YOY decline in quarterly deliveries since 2020 at the end of this year\u2019s first quarter. Tesla\u2019s delivery figures came below many of the estimates of Wall Street estimates. The latter hadn\u2019t predicted the firm\u2019s delivery numbers were going to be hit as badly they were.\n\nThe American EV maker is highly dependent on the American car market as well as that of China\u2019s. The U.S. market has performed dismally, unless you\u2019re Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN). Inflation, which has affected the price of new vehicles and car insurance, has kept consumers out of the burgeoning market.\n\nA possible Fed Rate cut could definitely pull TSLA out of the doldrums. The EV maker\u2019s share price has plummeted 24.6%year-t0-date (YTD). However, not every Wall Street firm or analyst is feeling that pessimistic. Tesla has garnered six strong buy ratings from analysts as well as 11 buy ratings, though a majority of analysts are rating the stock a hold.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 50 Largest Companies in Every State in the US, and in this article we will look at the largest company.\n\nEconomy of\u00a0 US\n\nThe United States holds the title of the largest economy in the world, according to the IMF in 2024 the United States had a GDP of approximately $28.78 trillion, a GDP per capita of around $85,370, and an annual GDP growth rate of 2.7%. In 2025, GDP is expected to rise to $29.84 trillion whereas GDP per capita is expected to rise around $87,980. The United States possesses a large and skilled labor force, a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit along with highly diversified companies in technology, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment which generate productivity and economic growth. Additionally, the U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency and is used to facilitate international trade and investment.\n\nCertain regions in the United States stand out as hubs of economic power and innovation. Silicon Valley in the San Franciso Bay Area, California has long been the hub of technological innovation in software, hardware, and biotechnology. Some of the largest tech giants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) among many others are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Wall Street, the financial district in Lower Manhattan in New York City on the other side is home to major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Wall Street serves as the center of the world's financial markets and facilitates the flow of capital, investments, and trading activities on a massive scale. In recent years, there has been a notable trend of companies relocating from high-tax states to low-tax states in pursuit of cost savings and favorable business environments. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are some of the largest companies that moved their incorporations from California to Texas. According to CNBC, more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Delaware. Delaware is one of the top choices for corporations due to their business-friendly policies, lower taxes, reduced regulation, and incentives for relocation. Delaware has a strategic location and its corporate law is highly developed, the state's Court of Chancery, a specialized court for business disputes, is known for its efficient resolution of legal cases. It allows businesses to maintain confidentiality and offers incentives for relocation such as tax credits, grants, and loans. Delaware does not have a state sales tax, and its corporate income tax of 8.7% is considered one of the lowest in the United States. You can also take a look at 15 States with No or Lowest Sales Tax Rates in the US.\n\nStory continues\n\nLargest Company in the US\n\nFounded in 1975, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a globally recognized company known for its software products, such as the Windows operating system and Office productivity tools. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure AI has also continued to lead in innovation by offering advanced APIs and models that are revolutionizing industries with its responsible AI solutions that facilitate the creation, reception, and interaction with images, videos, and audio.\u00a0Azure's market share is expanding due to its extensive portfolio of AI and cloud services. Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies and 53,000 customers now use the Azure OpenAI Service. The introduction of the Models as a Service API and partnerships with Nvidia and AMD for AI hardware accelerators are significantly boosting the growth of Microsoft's cloud business. Additionally, Microsoft's Copilot offerings, integrated into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, are transforming productivity and democratizing AI-powered capabilities, further increasing Microsoft's share in office productivity tools.\n\nAzure AI Services has also impacted the legal industry by efficiently managing and analyzing vast amounts of data in the fast-paced legal environment and the legal field is highly exposed to the effects of new AI technologies. With traditional data sources like emails and documents now supplemented by complex data types such as chat data and video recordings, legal teams face significant challenges. AI is increasingly used to streamline processes, reduce risks, and boost efficiency. Companies like Icertis, Relativity, and Clifford Chance are at the forefront of integrating AI into their operations by leveraging Azure AI Services to enhance contract management, e-discovery, and overall legal service delivery. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) commitment to responsible AI, ensuring data privacy, security, and governance highlights how AI advancements are driving growth, productivity, and innovation across industries.\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported that its revenue for the three months ended March 31, increased by 17% year over year to $61.9 billion and net income increased by 20% year over year to $21.9 billion. The company\u2019s Azure and cloud services revenue increased 31% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue amounted to $35.1 billion.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley, leads the world in technology and innovation and New York\u2019s Wall Street serves as the global hub for banking, investments, and trading, each state in the United States possesses its own unique strengths and specialties. With this context, let\u2019s take a look at the list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US. The Largest Company in the US\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US, we scanned the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners to find the largest companies by market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024. Then we checked where the headquarters of these companies are located. To quantify the \"value\" or \"size\" of private companies, we selected either the estimated valuation, the annual revenue available for the most recent fiscal year, or the number of employees, subject to the availability of data. The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees was sourced from official statements by the company and the company's website. We have ranked the 50 largest companies in every state in the US in ascending order of largest companies incorporated in that state according to their market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "3 AI Stock Underdogs Flying Below the Radar for Now",
        "content": "It\u2019s hard to tell just how long the AI boom will last. Even as headlines begin using the word \u201cbubble,\u201d I\u2019m not convinced that a big chunk of the tech scene is due for a horrid collapse in value, especially if AI bets start producing a bit of return or, in the case of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a massive return that exceeded estimates of many raging bulls on Wall Street.\n\nAt this juncture, it seems too risky to chase the hottest AI stocks after recent sizeable moves. At the same time, investors also stand to miss upside surges by timing their exits too prematurely in the companies that view the AI boom as a long-lived secular growth driver rather than a short-lived boost that\u2019ll end in tears. There are risks on both sides, to the upside and downside.\n\nIn any case, the AI underdogs may be worth looking into if you seek value and long-term AI upside. Some of the following AI underdogs have also been (mostly) left out of the latest year-to-date rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle (EV) maker first and foremost, and the stock certainly seems to reflect such as auto deliveries roll sharply lower. That said, TSLA stock may have lost a bit of its tech premium amid the latest rampant sell-off.\n\nUndoubtedly, Tesla can be a tough stock to value, given that it has several impressive innovations that could move the needle on growth in the long term. Indeed, fully autonomous vehicles and the rise of robotaxis may be seen as a potential \u201cwild card\u201d by many investors. However, self-driving capabilities are not where Tesla\u2019s AI prowess ends.\n\nThe company\u2019s Optimus Gen 2 robot has received praise from Elon Musk of late. Next year could be a big year for the humanoid robot as more of them find work at Tesla\u2019s factories. As AI takes more of a physical form in the next 10 years, perhaps Tesla is best equipped to benefit.\n\nUndoubtedly, incorporating humanoid robots could help reduce labor costs and allow the EV giant more flexibility to reduce EV costs to be more competitive with up-and-coming rivals in the U.S. and China. Are too many investors getting caught up in the auto dip and missing out on the longer-term AI-driven narrative? Time will tell.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock certainly seems like more of a value trap than a cheap AI play that investors may have taken the wrong way. At writing, INTC stock is down close to 40% from its 52-week highs. With enthusiasm over Intel\u2019s comeback all but evaporated, questions linger as to how the fallen chip stock can win back shareholders, many of whom may have gone for the likes of Nvidia. Why settle for an underdog when Nvidia, the world\u2019s new largest company, looks virtually untouchable?\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, Intel needs more than just a turnaround plan. It needs to execute and prove that it has more than just a puncher\u2019s chance to return to the conversation with today\u2019s AI chip leaders. Arguably, Intel needs to punch well above estimates to give investors confidence in the firm\u2019s AI footing.\n\nThough CEO Pat Gelsinger is a wonderful manager, there\u2019s concern that the market leaders, like Nvidia, are just moving way too fast, giving laggards next to no opportunity to play catch-up.\n\nWhile Intel is being aggressive with spend (investors seem off-put by rising costs), the company still seems like the \u201cbiggest head-scratcher in tech,\u201d as Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives put it.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top-notch cybersecurity company that\u2019s hovering close to all-time highs, just shy of $400 per share. Indeed, every major cyber threat that hits the headlines can be viewed as rallying fuel for cybersecurity stocks. As cyber threats grow even more dangerous with generative AI at their side, there has never been a worse time to cut back on cybersecurity-related spending.\n\nGiven the pace of AI innovation, I\u2019d argue the cybersecurity industry has timely enough tailwinds to bring forth even more upside. Further, we\u2019re probably entering an era where it\u2019s no longer sufficient to go with just any cybersecurity firm. To maximize protection, firms will need modern cybersecurity firms that are firmly grounded in the AI age.\n\nYou need to know AI to be able to fight off AI, after all.\n\nWith Charlotte AI, generative AI for the good guys, CrowdStrike may have the means to take further market share as it leverages AI in a way to expand the gap with industry rivals. As Charlotte AI advances its impressive multi-AI architecture, I view Crowdstrike as having the means to charge more as enterprises strive to get the most advanced AI-leveraging cybersecurity platform possible to prevent the nightmarish kinds of breaches we\u2019ve witnessed in recent years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Not every stock is a winner, and it\u2019s important to know when to cut your losses. While it\u2019s normal for corporations to report bad earnings every once in a while, some earnings reports can shatter growth narratives and put investors in tough spots.\n\nFurthermore, some stocks can rally substantially for 1 to 2 years before coming back down to earth. These growth stocks are particularly risky as some investors may hold their shares, hoping the corporations can reclaim their all-time highs. Investors should remember they can choose from thousands of companies. You can find many growth stocks that don\u2019t have red flags and have plenty of growth opportunities. With that in mind, why would you stick with a company that looks like it will underperform the stock market?\n\nThese are some of the stocks to sell before the market drops. Even if the market rallies, these stocks will likely be left behind.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) enjoyed its heyday during the pandemic as people were forced to stay in their homes. The stock quickly soared as more people used the video conferencing app to meet friends, attend class and arrive for business meetings.\n\nA return to normal times hasn\u2019t done much for Zoom. Shares are down 20% year-to-date and are roughly 90% down from their all-time high. Zoom trades at a 21 P/E ratio, but that shouldn\u2019t fool investors. Growth is stagnant at the company, as revenue only inched up 3.2% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nZoom\u2019s profits soared YOY, but it\u2019s a bit discouraging when profits come amid cost-cutting without revenue growth. Profit margin expansion possibilities are very limited when a company is only maintaining a single-digit revenue growth rate. Most Wall Street analysts are on the sidelines for this stock. It\u2019s rated as a Hold with five Buy ratings and one Sell rating. The remaining 15 analysts rated the stock as a Hold.\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing several headwinds. The company is losing ground in China as other EV manufacturers gobble up market share. China is an important market for Tesla\u2019s long-term growth story, and it appears to be shaky. Chinese EV manufacturers are producing high-quality vehicles at much lower prices than what you\u2019d find in the United States.\n\nChinese EV makers aren\u2019t showing up in the United States or the European Union solely because of high tariffs. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla and other EV makers when they try to tap into markets that aren\u2019t affected by those elevated tariffs. However, the problem is worse for Tesla stock since it trades at a 47 P/E ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla\u2019s revenue dropped by 13% YOY in the first quarter of 2024. Most of its revenue comes from automobiles, which doesn\u2019t warrant a tech company\u2019s valuation. Even its net profit margins look like an automobile company.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo on a phone screen on a blue background. Phone is in a little cart and there are packages around them. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is another stock that performed well during the pandemic and has been well removed from its all-time highs. Shares have crashed roughly 80% from all-time highs and are down 27% year-to-date. Declining gross merchandise sales (GMS) are the main culprit for the lack of enthusiasm around the stock. If this metric continues to decline, revenue and earnings will go along with it.\n\nInvestors saw that on full display in the first quarter of 2024. During that quarter, consolidated GMS dropped by 3.7% YOY. A lower GMS figure also impacted revenue and net income. Revenue was only up by 0.8% YOY, as higher fees and advertising helped to keep this figure flat. The company wasn\u2019t as lucky with its profits, as net income dropped 15% YOY.\n\nEtsy isn\u2019t the same place as it was a few years ago. It\u2019s more difficult to find handmade goods that don\u2019t resemble products you could buy from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Furthermore, the company\u2019s heightened fees have frustrated sellers. Etsy\u2019s management got greedy with its fees during the pandemic in hopes of boosting shareholder returns. Now, investors are jumping off the ship before things get worse.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market continues to climb. But in this case, a rising tide isn\u2019t necessarily lifting all boats.\n\nIn fact, high interest rates, geopolitics and a challenging macroeconomic environment have created several problems for many firms. Make no mistake: Many companies are facing severe problems trying to navigate the current landscape.\n\nTraders are looking to penny stocks for big upside, particularly as the rest of the market has already rocketed higher. But there is little reason for hope for these seven penny stocks to sell. These struggling companies are in sorry condition, and investors should get their cash out of these stocks before it\u2019s too late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNikola (NKLA) Image of NKLA logo on phone screen\n\nSource: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is still sputtering along. The company infamously committed fraud during the tenure of its former CEO, Trevor Milton. Milton was, in fact, sentenced to four years in prison for engaging in wire fraud and securities fraud.\n\nSince then, Nikola pivoted the business model. It built a factory in Arizona and is attempting to create a sustainable business around hydrogen-powered EV drivetrains.\n\nLast quarter, Nikola delivered 40 hydrogen-powered EV semi trucks, which was up from the 31 it delivered in the same quarter of 2023. Despite this, the company\u2019s revenues actually fell year-over-year and the company reported a massive operating loss.\n\nAll this is to say that Nikola should be applauded for trying to recover from its past scandals. But its business simply isn\u2019t picking up steam quickly enough to turn the price of NKLA stock around.\n\nFuelcell Energy (FCEL) Person holding cellphone with logo of US fuel cell company FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFuelcell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) develops and sells\u00a0fuel cell and electrolysis platforms. Its goal is to offer renewable power while helping decarbonize the energy grid. However, Fuelcell\u2019s products struggled to find much traction with customers.\n\nAs of April 30, FuelCell Energy has amassed an\u00a0accumulated deficit of almost $1.6 billion. This means that the company has spent well over a billion dollars on shareholder funding over the decades.\n\nYet there\u2019s surprisingly little to show for it. FuelCell generated $123 million of revenues in 2023, down sharply from the $180 million annual revenues it generated a decade ago, back in 2014.\n\nThe company lost $107 million in 2023 on those revenues, indicating the company is nowhere near profitability. In fact, the company hasn\u2019t generated a year of positive net income even once over the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s possible that FCEL stock will rally again due to a short squeeze or renewed enthusiasm in hydrogen stocks. However, given the long-term poor fundamental track record, FCEL stock will likely keep dropping toward zero over time.\n\nFaraday Future Intelligent Electric (FFIE) Mobile phone with logo of electric vehicle company Faraday Future Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on center-right of phone display. Unmodified photo. FFIE stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFaraday Future Intelligent Electric (NASDAQ:FFIE) is one of the oddest meme stock stories out there.\n\nFFIE stock appeared to be kaput just a month ago, with shares trading as low as 4 cents each in May. Then, meme stock mania hit. With the return of the trader known as Roaring Kitty, certain highly-shorted penny stocks blasted off. FFIE shares, for their part, went from 4 cents to $4.\n\nThese gains would prove fleeting, however. Because, under the surface, there\u2019s simply nothing to back up this sort of move.\n\nThe numbers are startling. Faraday generated just $800,000 in revenues in 2023, while losing $432 million. It also recently withdrew its production guidance for 2024, giving investors little reason to expect meaningful improvement. Given the company\u2019s shaky balance sheet, it\u2019s time to stick a fork in this failing penny stock.\n\nTellurian (TELL) Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harbor\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech Wrzesien\n\nTellurian (NYSE:TELL) is an energy company that has primarily been seeking to try to develop LNG export terminals, and it also operates an upstream energy business.\n\nTellurian has struggled to secure adequate\u00a0funding for planned LNG terminals. This led to a collapse in the share price. The CEO also recently left the company.\n\nTellurian already appeared to be running out of time, and then political issues added to the struggles. Specifically, the Biden Administration announced that it is pausing approvals of new LNG export facilities for now, making Tellurian\u2019s already shaky business case even more challenging.\n\nWith the stock price well under a dollar, traders might be under the assumption that shares are cheap and worth a potential lottery ticket bet at this price. However, the market capitalization is above $500 million due to unending share dilution over the years. That makes TELL stock an awfully expensive lottery ticket on a company whose business model is in grave trouble and whose CEO just left.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is a company seeking to power up the electric vehicle landscape.\n\nInvestors once gravitated to EV charging companies as a clear \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d beneficiary of the broader industry trend. As EVs gain market share, chargers should become increasingly valuable infrastructure for the 21st century in the same way that gas stations were a great business in prior decades.\n\nWhile the underlying thesis is logical and sound, it\u2019s far from assured that independent players like ChargePoint will be the ultimate winners. EV manufacturers such as\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have already built large charging networks and oil and gas companies are making large investments in the space as well.\n\nEV charging will likely be a great business as the industry matures. But there\u2019s little proof that small independent players like ChargePoint will be the ultimate winners once the industry consolidates.\n\nTraders are likely hoping for a short squeeze after CHPT stock\u2019s outsized losses over the past year. However, due to dilution, the company still has a chunky $700 million market capitalization despite being a penny stock. With revenue growth stalling out and the company running massive losses, ChargePoint\u2019s story has run out of juice.\n\nMicroVision (MVIS) Autonomous self driving electric car using lidar change the lane and overtakes city vehicle. MVIS stock\n\nSource: temp-64GTX / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS) is a technology company that was founded in 1993 and went public in 1996. Over the years, it attempted to commercialize various products and services, but little has caught on.\n\nMVIS stock has fallen from a (split-adjusted) peak of $500 per share in 2000 to just $1 today. Shareholders have paid a heavy price for Microvision\u2019s string of unsuccessful business ventures. Over the past decade, Microvision\u2019s peak revenue year was 2018, when it brought in $18 million in revenues. Since then, however, that business line has been discontinued, and revenues have plunged to well under $10 million annually.\n\nMicrovision\u2019s current lead product is a light detection and ranging (lidar) system to help commercialize self-driving vehicles.\n\nHowever, lidar remains an unproven field and even industry leaders like Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) have seen their share prices collapse over the past year. There\u2019s little reason to believe that MicroVision, with its limited financial resources and poor track record, will be able to compete in this industry.\n\nGinkgo Bioworks (DNA) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American biotechnology company Ginkgo Bioworks Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. DNA stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGinkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) is a specialty chemical company\u00a0that operates\u00a0primarily in\u00a0the\u00a0healthcare and life sciences\u00a0space.\u00a0It has developed a synthetic biology platform to help clients with cell programming \u2014 the idea being that Ginkgo can enable the biological production of novel therapeutics, food ingredients and petroleum-derived chemicals.\n\nThe most obvious application\u00a0is in biotech to aid the research and development of new drug therapies. This made for a compelling story. Ark Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood was a prominent backer, and shares rocketed higher. However, short sellers raised a number of troubling allegations about the firm\u2019s revenues, corporate strategy, and\u00a0third-party relationships.\n\nWhile short sellers often get things wrong, the accusations appear to have been on the mark in this case. Ginkgo Bioworks\u2019 revenues reached their peak at $478 million in fiscal year 2022 but plunged nearly in half to $251 million last year.\n\nThose concerns\u00a0appear to\u00a0have played out.\u00a0The company\u2019s revenues peaked at $478 million in fiscal year 2022 but fell to just $251 million last year. Analysts expect another steep decline to $186 million in revenues for the current year. The company lost a stunning $854 million over the past 12 months, and its balance sheet won\u2019t sustain these losses for long. That makes DNA a penny stock to sell immediately.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Bank of America tells Detroit\u2019s Big 3 they can\u2019t make money in China and should just leave the hypercompetitive car market \u2018as soon as they possibly can\u2019",
        "content": "Detroit automakers General Motors (GM), Ford and Stellantis should abandon the competitive Chinese market \u201cas soon as they possibly can\u201d and focus on the U.S., Bank of America analysts believe.\n\n\u201cWe think exiting China from a pure profit and strategic standpoint makes sense, to focus on where you\u2019re making money\u2014 which is North American trucks,\u201d John Murphy, BofA auto analyst, said on Tuesday per The Detroit News and CNBC.\n\nThanks to a longstanding history in China via its century-old Buick brand, GM once minted money in the nation during the 2010s, earning upwards of $2 billion annually at its peak when it sold 4 million vehicles.\n\nBut the rising strength of homegrown rivals like BYD and Geely mean volumes and profits are drying up. GM sales in China dropped to 2.1 million vehicles in 2023, and it posted a loss of $106 million in the past quarter\u2014only its third in 15 years.\n\nThe situation is even less appetizing at Ford and the former Chrysler group\u2014merged with France\u2019s Peugeot Citroen\u2014now known as Stellantis. The duo have thus far failed to carve out a sustainable and significant share of the local car market, the largest in the world with a record 30 million vehicles sold last year.\n\nAs a result, Murphy argued financing losses in China going forward will sap the three carmakers dry. He added they should leave \"as soon as they can\" in order to redeploy their resources towards developing an EV line-up competitive with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla.\n\n\u201cFocus on your core,\u201d Murphy said, speaking at an event organized by the Automotive Press Association where he presented the bank\u2019s annual Car Wars report. \u201cAnd China is no longer a core strategy to GM, Ford or Stellantis.\u201d\n\nFortune reached out to all three Detroit carmakers for a statement, but did not receive a comment by press time.\n\nShould all three decide to move out of China entirely, it would leave Musk\u2019s Tesla as the only remaining American car brand competitive in all three major global car markets, which also include North America and Europe.\n\nChinese carmakers have methodically put the squeeze on weaker western brands, largely by hiring European car designers to create stylish vehicles, built in state-of-the art factories staffed with lower-cost labor. Many brands also now have access to technology developed overseas\u2014either through joint venture transfers or the outright acquisition of western brands like Volvo.\n\nDetroit cannot catch up to Tesla while still funding losses in China\n\nChinese consumers also have high expectations of their tech\u2014spending a vast amount of time and money on seamless apps like WeChat\u2014and so expect the same from their vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed one of the reasons why the ID line of EVs sold by the Volkswagen brand\u2014long the undisputed market leader in China\u2014disappointed when measured against expectations was a perceived poor value-for-money. This largely stemmed from its barebones infotainment system and substandard software when compared to rivals.\n\nOn the other hand Tesla, which pioneered the concept of an electric vehicle capable of remote over-the-air updates, still remains competitive to this day by comparison\u2014even as its hardware, i.e. the cars themselves, are already considered ordinary by Chinese consumers. Additionally, with the sole exception of GM\u2019s Buick, Detroit brands like Ford and Chrysler had no heritage, no premium cache, and no technology.\n\nBut the recent deflationary downturn in China sparked by an imploding real estate market lead to a brutal price war that many western carmakers cannot or will not follow. It has even pushed homegrown brands to seek their fortune abroad in healthier export markets.\n\nDetroit\u2019s automakers need to make a choice\u2014do they still want to harbor global ambitions or do they want to cut into the substantial lead Musk\u2019s company enjoys on EV manufacturing costs?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be mission critical to ultimately becoming competitive on a price and cost basis with Tesla,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cPushing volume at the moment and losing money doesn\u2019t make a tremendous amount of sense.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy as the Electric Vehicle Market Revs Back Up",
        "content": "The global electric vehicle (EV) market has suffered more than anyone ever imagined it would. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to make news, there is so much more going on in the EV industry. The sales have slowed over the past few months, and EV makers have already addressed this issue by cutting down on the production targets, which ultimately impacted EV stocks. However, there is a bright side to the current situation for investors looking for EV stocks to buy.\n\nThe U.S. has incentivized the purchase of EVs through tax subsidies and grants. While the EV market is not expected to pick up anytime soon, one cannot deny the future is electric. Sooner or later, people will have to transition towards electric vehicles. Developing nations like India have started to see higher demand and adoption of EVs over the past year. If you can take a little risk and have the patience to hold onto your stock until the market improves, here are three stocks to buy.\n\nEV Stocks to Buy: BYD (BYDDF) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nIn the period between Jan and May 2024, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) continued to hold the largest share in China\u2019s EV market, taking the crown from Tesla. It holds a 33.4% passenger market share in China, with retail sales of 268,226 vehicles in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring this period, the company\u2019s sales rose by 20% year over year (YOY), giving it a top spot in the industry. Trading at $29 today, the stock is up 8% year-to-date (YTD) but down 11% in the past 12 months. BYDDF has become one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nBYD is a global powerhouse that is expanding at a rapid pace. Besides holding the largest market share for batteries, the company also beat Tesla in EV deliveries in 2023. The company is now entering the electric bus market in London and intends to replace the Boris Bus.\n\nBYD doesn\u2019t have to worry about the high tariff concerns in the U.K. It has ample space to grow in Europe and will have the lowest additional tax levy. That means BYD can also enjoy pricing power in Europe and expand its market share. It is currently building a factory in Europe and will export to the E.U.\n\nThe company is also building a factory in Hungary, making it the first Chinese automaker to build cars in Europe. The biggest benefit that BYD has is its global presence. It is already an established player in the industry and is set to benefit once the market revs up. Citi(NYSE:C) opened a 30-day upside catalyst watch and has a Buy rating for the stock.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nA top 2023 EV stock, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) had a very slow start to 2024. Having reported impressive delivery numbers and fundamentals, the company saw a drop in EV demand, leading to lower production and sales.\n\nHowever, I think Li Auto is one of the best EV players out there. LI stock is trading for $18 today and has lost 49% of its value since the beginning of the year. The EV maker is focused on SUVs and enjoys a price advantage. The company started delivering EVs in 2019 and saw a tremendous upside in 2023. That allowed the company to turn profitable last year, and analysts are expecting to see a steady revenue increase this year.\n\nThe company delivered a total of 80,400 cars in the first quarter and delivered nearly 61,000 vehicles in April and May combined. Li Auto is not the one to sit back and wait for the industry to improve. Instead, it is scaling up production, working on new marketing campaigns and ramping up the Mega shipments.\n\nIt recently launched the Li L6. The company will also be investing over 6 billion yuan in building 5,000 charging stations. While the process may take time, it will open a new revenue line for the business. The company is profitable, setting it apart from several other EV companies.\n\nAn improvement in the macro environment could boost the EV market, and Li Auto will be the first one to benefit. Once the sales stabilize, there is no going back for the company. LI is one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutomaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) has been in the industry for many years and has seen several market ups and downs. The company is investing heavily in the EV segment and managed to deliver 75,000 EVs last year and 9,500 EVs in May this year.\n\nIt has committed to invest $35 billion in the sector in 2024. Once the economy recovers, we could see General Motors report tremendous growth. It managed to sell a total of 2.6 million cars last year, which shows its strong position in the auto industry\n\nIt saw a 21% jump in EV retail customer deliveries in the first quarter and has ambitious goals to produce 200,000 and 300,000 EVs this year. The management announced a $6 billion share repurchase plan and also hiked its dividend by 33% in the quarter. General Motors is doing well as compared to its competitors, who are bleeding cash due to the slow EV demand.\n\nWhile the company has slowed down EV production, it will manage to return cash to shareholders. Once the market picks up, GM will be ready with its lineup. It is aiming to end gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035. The management will invest $850 million in Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary this month to relaunch it.\n\nTrading at $47, the stock is up 33% YTD and is very close to its 52-week high of $49. The stock still looks undervalued to me and is a buy below $50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy After the Elon Musk Pay Package Approval",
        "content": "By now we\u2019re all aware of the outcome following Elon Musk\u2019s recent shareholder vote to both approve his whopping $56 billion pay package (and subsequent plan to reincorporate in Texas). While there\u2019s still a long way to go legally, the vote pushes Musk\u2019s beneficial ownership of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) from about 13% to 20.5%, though this still falls a tad shy of his 25% ownership goal. The question, now, on many investors\u2019 minds is \u201cWhich stocks to buy now?\u201d\n\nWhile the first stock on the list won\u2019t surprise you, picking other stocks to buy on the news is less easy. You\u2019d generally expect a rising tide to lift all boats (stocks) associated with Musk, but, of course, Tesla remains his sole public company today \u2013 SpaceX, X, Neuralink, et al. are all private companies and even his other former public properties like SolarCity are rolled up under other company umbrellas.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no chance of catching some marginal upside \u2014 it just means you may have to dig a little deeper to find stocks to buy in light of the news.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla is the clear winner of Musk\u2019s major pay package win, as the ownership stake increase reduces key man risk for the company, or the widely-expected potential of Musk losing interest in the company in favor of others, or even moving hot properties like robotics and artificial intelligence initiatives to other business interests.\n\nAlready Musk is proving the thesis true, publicly floating the idea of an uber-affordable Tesla Model Y priced around $20,000 and exploring the unit economics, saying that \u201cit would sell like five million units.\u201d However, he amended the statement somewhat as \u201cthat\u2019s not feasible today.\u201d\n\nStill, even if Musk has a history of big-picture plans that take longer than anticipated to roll out, his renewed focus on Tesla is a big deal for shareholders, even if the stock didn\u2019t surge quite as high as many expected, largely because Musk\u2019s newfound wealth is ultimately dilutive to shareholders. While Cathie Wood\u2019s $2,600 expected value for Tesla shares may be overblown, this stock is definitely the top beneficiary of Musk\u2019s big win last week.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA logo on phone and blurred AI chip on the background. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nMusk is adamant about his vision of artificial intelligence, but that enthusiasm also posed a problem before the pay package approval. A handful of investors filed suit against Musk last week, charging the Tesla CEO with improper use of existing Tesla tech. Specifically, they pointed to a perceived \u201cdiversion of Tesla\u2019s value to xAI and X, as he alone has made decisions to redirect talent, resources, and valuable GPUs to those competitors.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile mitigating key man risk, coupled with the lawsuit, may force Musk\u2019s hand to re-divert those resources to Tesla, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is among the stocks to buy to capitalize on Elon\u2019s AI focus in either case.\n\nMusk is a massive buyer of Nvidia hardware already, and a renewed centrality of his AI emphasis toward Tesla may accelerate the purchasing as Tesla has quite a bit more cash in its coffers than X (presumably) has, though determining to what extent is tough since X isn\u2019t required to post financials. Still, Musk already affirmed a ballpark $3 \u2013 $4 billion in net Tesla expenditure on Nvidia products this year, so expect the already massive chipmaker to continue reaping the rewards moving forward.\n\nTripadvisor (TRIP) Closeup of iPhone Screen with TRIPADVISOR LOGO during Start screen\n\nSource: Mano Kors / Shutterstock.com\n\nTripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) may seem an unlikely pick among stocks to buy if you want to capitalize on Musk\u2019s shareholder vote win, but it\u2019s peripherally very important. Remember that, in addition to the pay package, shareholders voted to reincorporate away from Delaware following a judge\u2019s apparent activist attitude toward corporate governance. The initial ruling included the judge calling the previously approved payment structure \u201cunfathomable.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tripadvisor paved the way for Tesla in this respect, even if many don\u2019t know about it. In February, the travel company tried to divest itself from Delaware in a bid to move to Nevada. Though two-thirds of shareholders approved the move, minority shareholders sued (in Delaware) to prevent the pivot.\n\nEssentially, the argument boiled down to the fact that Delaware corporate law \u201cprotects investors through a combination of statutory provisions and common law fiduciary duties\u201d but that allowing \u201ca stockholder controller [to] reduce the rights investors enjoy by changing the corporation\u2019s domicile\u201d would be a breach of that duty. In other words, all investors matter, even the little guys, and the litigant\u2019s position demanded Delaware ensure maximal benefit to the individual and select shareholder rights.\n\nThat didn\u2019t pan out, and Delaware judge J. Travis Laster declined to move the suit forward (though they can still sue for monetary damages). In other words, Tripadvisor wrote the playbook for Musk moving forward and provides valuable precedent to keep the reincorporation plan rolling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Though economic and stock news alike points toward renewed national financial and monetary strength, on-the-ground vibes seem to negate the apparent facts. And, though we can\u2019t always pick stocks to buy now on a vibes-based investment thesis, it\u2019s important to keep the overall uneasy consumer sentiment in mind even as the stock market hits new all-time highs.\n\nThat\u2019s why finding stocks to buy now isn\u2019t easy \u2013 did you miss the boat on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? Or will it keep ripping post-split? Is Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) OpenAI partnership a strategic blunder or the next step in consumer electronics?\n\nThere\u2019s just too much uncertainty in today\u2019s markets, but these diverse stocks to buy now offer a wider perspective while creating long-term speculative opportunities undergirded by a firm foundational of perennial winners.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the easiest pick among the many stocks to buy now. It scored a win after the recent shareholder vote to approve Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package and move operations from Delaware to Texas. The stock didn\u2019t react as many expected, though, and still trades well below even six-month highs.\n\nThe bull case for Tesla is widely stated and doesn\u2019t bear repeating. Though I disagree with the price target, ARK Invest\u2019ssummary of Tesla\u2019s long-term potential is a great analysis of the overall market and Tesla\u2019s unique positioning moving forward.\n\nMore importantly, though, Tesla\u2019s shareholder vote win marks a major milestone in corporate law that makes the stock worth buying in its own right. Whether you agree or disagree with the pay package, having a judge legislate from the bench and calling the pay package \u201can unfathomable sum\u201d before overriding existing board agreements is not how we want corporate governance managed.\n\nThink about it \u2014 much like presidential candidates promise to overturn past administrations\u2019 decisions and create a cycle where little ultimately gets done year-to-year, we don\u2019t want completely unrelated third parties (activist shareholders are a different story) stepping in to tell public companies how to do business. That introduces an element of risk and uncertainty that ultimately degrades all U.S.-based stock investing \u2014 which is why Musk\u2019s big win is such a big deal and also makes Tesla one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) Close view of Tilray (TLRY) logo on a smart phone. Tilray specializes in cannabis research, cultivation, processing and distribution. TLRY stock\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock is back in the gutter, trading nearly 25% below January\u2019s per-share pricing. But I\u2019m a perennial bull toward Tilray and think it\u2019s the only standout company among cannabis stocks to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, I think that Tilray\u2019s craft beer business is a huge deal that is overlooked by the wider investment class. Following its 2023 brand acquisitions from Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), Tilray\u2019s alcohol sales surged more than 100%, providing a much-needed source of sale diversification in a crowded cannabis market.\n\nMoreover, many overlook the craft beer segment\u2019s latent potential. When \u2014 not if \u2014 cannabis is recreationally legal to a wider extent, if not federally permissible, Tilray has a baked-in network of production, distribution, and operational facilities, including legal and marketing, that it can tap to push cannabis products nationally. This competitive advantage is huge and, again, mostly goes overlooked.\n\nTilray is looking to expand again, seeking $250 million to fund strategic acquisitions and peripheral business investments. Of course, the offering will be dilutive, but that makes the per-share pricing all the more sweet for long-term investors wanting to capture some sector upside among cannabis stocks to buy now.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT (APLE) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nImproved consumer sentiment and summer travel season are colliding, and few stocks to buy now are set to capture that unique investment intersection than Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE:APLE). Apple Hospitality owns more than 200 hotel properties in America and leases them to top-tier hoteliers like Marriot (NASDAQ:MAR) and Hilton (NYSE:HLT). With a 6.5% dividend yield, Apple Hospitality is beating fixed-income options while offering upside to some of the priciest properties with the most reliable tenants in the business.\n\nThe company\u2019s most recent quarterly report included a solid funds from operations boost to $83.24 million, up from $78.96 million the prior year. Funds from operations are a real estate investment trust-centric stand-in for earnings, so Apple Hospitality\u2019s stat spiking over a relatively depressed travel cycle means big things moving forward.\n\nMoreover, Apple Hospitality is capturing upside from increased business travel rates, with midweek bookings increasing substantially over the quarter. This means that Apple Hospitality is set to take advantage of the summer leisure travel season while maintaining stability with business travel and keeping beds occupied throughout the workweek.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications.

ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSmall-cap space stock AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) could be this year\u2019s standout performer among stocks to buy now. This space-based telecommunications stock, dedicated to providing global data coverage directly to standard cell phones, surged over 300% in the past month, achieving a 104% gain year-to-date.\n\nThis remarkable rise follows the announcement of substantial contracts with established telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to extend cellular services to geographically isolated and remote areas globally. The Verizon contract alone is valued at $100 million, while AT&T\u2019s deal builds on a January strategic investment of $20 million and six years of collaborative tech testing and prototyping.\n\nAdditionally, AST SpaceMobile has taken significant strides toward revenue generation, recording $500,000 in net sales from government contracts in the last quarter. Though modest considering its recent surge, this revenue is a crucial step toward profitability and signals the beginning of broader operational opportunities for the company.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock\u00a0(GLDD) Container ships now carry about 90 of the world's cargo and the largest container ships can carry over 21,000 units. This one is operated by ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM stock)\n\nSource: Darryl Brooks / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (NASDAQ:GLDD) provides a vital service that often flies under the radar of most retail investors, making it an overlooked play among stocks to buy now. This company specializes in deepening, dredging, and expanding waterways along coasts and within ports, playing a crucial role in global trade and supply chains. This function positions it as a somewhat recession-proof investment, while its work in coastal beach reclamation ties it to efforts in climate change management.\n\nGreat Lakes\u2019 recent financial report shows strength post-pandemic in a sector that suffered more than most and for longer. The company\u2019s EBITDA hit $43 million, the highest since the end of 2021, and marks a period of imminent resurgence for the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, Great Lakes stands to benefit from a record-setting budget of $8.7 billion from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which spells a robust bidding environment ripe for securing steady contract cash flows. With a dredging backlog of $879 million, the company can easily project future income, further stabilizing its financial outlook as supply chains stabilize.\n\nBuzzfeed\u00a0(BZFD) Buzzfeed (BZFD) logo on a phone with a keyboard in the background. Buzzfeed layoffs\n\nSource: Meir Chaimowitz / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re surprised to see struggling media company Buzzfeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) listed among these stocks to buy now, let me explain. Buzzfeed faced its share of challenges, including declining quality and controversies over plagiarism, undue advertiser influence, and a series of unpopular political stances that have alienated many readers. These and other issues have led to its classification by Fairness & Accuracy in Reportingas having a political bias that is \u201cborderline creepy.\u201d This backdrop sets the stage for former presidential candidate and activist investor Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently acquired a 7.7% stake in Buzzfeed, aiming to enact significant changes \u2014 and I think he\u2019s just the activist investor to re-right the ship.\n\nRamaswamy, a Republican, plans to engage with Buzzfeed\u2019s board and management to discuss various operational and strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including a strategic shift for the company. His move likely stems from a perceived lack of quality independent media outlets, and he is pushing for greater transparency, objectivity, and quality in media reporting. While Buzzfeed\u2019s management has shown resistance, Ramaswamy\u2019s Strive Asset Management, though a relatively new player, is quickly becoming influential in activist investing circles and may pave the way toward a new era in hyper-targeted media marketing.\n\nSharkninja\u00a0(SN) a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and more\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Digital Genetics\n\nConsidering the current economic conditions, labeling what seems like a typical consumer discretionary stock and appliance manufacturer as one of the best stocks to buy now may initially seem misplaced\u2014until you examine Sharkninja\u2019s (NYSE:SN) impressive long-term trading chart. With a consistent 20% compounded annual growth rate in sales since 2008, Sharkninja has successfully navigated through multiple economic downturns. Even \u201cDowntown\u201d Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritzholz Wealth Management,thinks that Sharkninja is one of today\u2019s hottest stocks and recently added it to the firm\u2019s holdings.\n\nSince its IPO last summer, Sharkninja\u2019s stock already delivered a 77% return to its early investors, outstripping the S&P 500\u2019s performance threefold during the same period and showing no signs of slowing down. The company\u2019s most recent quarterly report highlighted a remarkable 25% increase in sales, particularly notable against the backdrop of significant sales drops from major retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT). With its solid market presence and extensive product lineup, Sharkninja stands out as one of today\u2019s most viable long-term stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Why automakers are backtracking on their ambitious EV game plans",
        "content": "As summer unfolds with spring in the rear-view mirror, sales staff at car dealerships across the country are clearing out inventory to make way for the new 2025 models coming in the fall.\n\nBut one car group is still clogging up dealer lots: EVs. The relatively high cost of EVs, range anxiety, and American consumer preference for hybrids are a few factors to blame.\n\nThe latest data from S&P Mobility finds that EV inventory at the end of April climbed 5.7% compared to the prior month and rose 105% compared to a year ago. This despite steep discounting for EVs through most of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said.\n\nEV-only startups are especially feeling the pain. California-based Fisker just filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday. Its demise follows Lordstown Motors' filing only a year ago.\n\nGiven that automakers other than Tesla are selling EVs at a loss, it's not surprising car manufacturers across the board have been backtracking. Last week, Ford (F) CFO John Lawler said COVID boosted EV sales. But once those buyers and early adopters were accounted for, the broader group of buyers failed to jump in. A Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicles are shown on a dealership lot, Wednesday, May 29, 2024, in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, Pool) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMainstream buyers are \"not willing to put up with some of the other issues that you might have with an EV around range and those types of things,\u201d Lawler told Yahoo Finance .\u201cI think you're going to see the growth continue, [but] it's going be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the past.\u201d\n\nLawler believes Ford\u2019s second-generation EVs are where the company will see profitability, but those vehicles won\u2019t be coming until late 2025 or 2026 at the earliest. Meanwhile, the company said back in April it was pushing back EV production at its massive BlueOval City EV campus in Tennessee to 2026 from its initial 2025 start date. It also shared that Ford was \u201cretiming\u201d the launch of upcoming EVs.\n\nGM (GM) is plotting a similar strategy. The company has backed away from its initial big EV plans, with CFO Paul Jacobson revealing at a Deutsche Bank conference that GM now expects to produce 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, slightly lower than the 200,000 to 300,000 unit plan. GM at one point projected a production run on as many as 400,000 EVs this year.\n\nStill, Jacobson told Yahoo Finance at the conference, \u201cWe're picking up significant [EV market] share; we sold over 9,500 EVs in North America last month.\" The Chevrolet Blazer and Cadillac LYRIQ EV had \u201creally strong gains,\u201d Jacobson added.\n\nThe moves by Ford and GM follow similar pivots from Big Three rival Stellantis (STLA), which paused development of a joint venture battery factory with Mercedes (STLA), and instead signed a deal with China\u2019s Leapmotor to build EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercedes pivoted hard from its plan to be all-electric by 2030, with the German luxury automaker seeing only 50% of sales being \u201celectrified\u201d \u2014 meaning both hybrids and full EVs \u2014 by 2030.\n\nGermany\u2019s Volkswagen (VOW3.DE) has also pulled back. For instance, the company canceled the US release of its ID.7 EV sedan last month. Customers \u201cwant plug-in hybrids now, including in China and the US,\u201d Volkswagen Passenger Cars CEO Thomas Sch\u00e4fer said in an interview at a conference in London, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nHow did automakers get the EV timing wrong? Visitors at the New York International Auto Show in New York last March. (Liu Yanan/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAmericans were never prepared to embrace electric vehicles at the rate predicted by many industry and government 'experts,'\" iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt was obvious getting from 3% to 7% EV share was much easier than getting from 7% to 10%. And getting EV share to 20%, 30%, or more percent? That was clearly a long ways off.\u201d\n\nSaid CarGurus director of industry insights Kevin Roberts: \u201cThe hoped-for EV adoption curve always felt accelerated by an understandable mix of government desire to reduce emissions, along with automakers looking to match Tesla\u2019s margins and stock price success.\u201d He added, \"Decisions were made to attempt to go straight to EVs, and bypass a transitional generation of hybrid powertrains that would\u2019ve allowed for more time to develop consumer comfort in the segment and build up charging infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor companies like Ford and GM, refocusing on gas-powered and hybrid powertrains seems like a logical move. And the prospect of producing cars that are already cash-flow positive \u2014 and leveraging Chinese partners for EVs \u2014 was sweet music to Wall Street.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, the automakers best positioned to capitalize on the growing popularity of hybrids include Asian original equipment manufacturers ... such as Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), and Hyundai (HYMTF), as well as U.S. automaker Ford,\u201d CFRA\u2019s Garrett Nelson wrote in a research piece in April.\n\n\u201cFord had considerable success with the sale of traditional hybrid versions of two pickup truck models: the Maverick (52,361 units) and the F-150 (50,103 units) in 2023. Also worth mentioning is Stellantis, whose Jeep Wrangler 4xe and Grand Cherokee 4xe were the two bestselling plug-in hybrid models in the U.S. last year,\u201d Nelson added.\n\nConversely, Nelson said automakers who made larger bets on pure battery EVs, such as GM, are less favorably positioned.\n\nTrouble down the road?\n\nThe question remains: Will companies like Ford, GM, Stellantis, and others who have pulled back investments eventually lose EV market share \u2014 and will companies who have kept innovating and spending emerge as the big winners in the eventual EV transformation?\n\nChinese EV makers are going full force into new vehicles with cutting-edge tech and self-driving features. For example, take the success of newer tech brands like Xiaomi and established EV makers like BYD.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese already have every advantage when it comes to EVs, from controlling the global lithium supply to aligning their government and manufacturing sectors to reduce production costs,\u201d iSeeCars\u2019 Brauer added.\n\n\u201c[American automakers] are not ready,\u201d said Stella Li, BYD Americas CEO, about US automakers and their EV game plans in an interview with NBC News in April. \u201cWe are ready. We are ready for technology, and we are more ready on supply chain.\u201d\n\nIn response to the China EV threat, the US and EU announced tariffs against Chinese EV makers, with the US quadrupling levies to 100%, and EU rates going as high as 38.1%. But tariffs and other trade restrictions are not usually a long-term answer, with the failed restrictions on Japanese automakers in the \u201880s a prime example.\n\nPerhaps the old adage, \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them,\u201d might be how automakers like GM, Ford, and Stellantis handle their EV pivots.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Western auto firms (including Tesla) have come to a unanimous and simultaneous realization: China has won the contest for EV supremacy,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients last month. Jonas predicts the industry will enter a new phase of lower spending, higher protectionism through tariffs, and likely cooperation with China with regards to producing and developing EVs.\n\nHowever, tastes in automobiles in the US versus the rest of the world may play in favor of legacy automakers \u2014 the Big Three plus Toyota, VW, and others \u2014 who have been making cars tailored for Americans for some time.\n\nSaid CarGurus' Roberts, \u201cThe US market might prove to be unique enough in its vehicle taste\" like SUVs and pickups, \"while most of the low-cost Chinese EVs tend to be much smaller vehicles, which US consumers tend to shun.\u201d\n\nIn other words, for American automakers, there may be a path to success.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Tesla vehicle owners can pursue a proposed class action accusing billionaire Elon Musk's electric car company of monopolizing markets for repairs and parts, breathing new life into a lawsuit she dismissed last November.\n\nU.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Monday that owners could try to prove that Tesla coerced them into paying high prices and suffering long waits to have their vehicles fixed, under fear of losing warranty coverage.\n\nOwners said Tesla's alleged coercion violated the federal Sherman antitrust law and California antitrust law.\n\nThompson found evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's alleged refusal to open enough authorized service centers, and its designing vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide.\n\nEvidence of a parts monopoly included restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla,\" and Tesla's selling parts to consumers only on a limited basis, the judge said.\n\nThompson also found evidence Tesla's alleged illegal \"tying\" of various markets \"coerces customers into undesired purchases.\"\n\nTesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nThey contended that the complaint was based on an \"illogical theory\" that Tesla intentionally degraded repairs and parts, jeopardizing its far more profitable business of selling and leasing vehicles.\n\nMatt Ruan, a lawyer for the plaintiff owners, said they were pleased with the court's well-reasoned and thoughtful decision, and looked forward to the next phase of the case.\n\nThe complaint combined five lawsuits by vehicle owners who have paid for Tesla repairs and parts since March 2019.\n\nThey said the Austin, Texas-based company differed from rivals by insisting it handle servicing and parts, rather than let owners use independent shops and other companies' parts.\n\nTesla sells its vehicles directly to consumers, instead of through franchisees.\n\nIt reported $8.3 billion of services and other automotive revenue in 2023, accounting for 9% of its $96.8 billion total revenue. Vehicle sales totaled $78.5 billion.\n\nThe case is Lambrix v Tesla Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 23-01145.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Automotive - Domestic stocks have likely encountered both Ford Motor Company (F) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nFord Motor Company and Tesla are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that F has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nF currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.87, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 76.01. We also note that F has a PEG ratio of 0.76. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.52.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for F is its P/B ratio of 1.10. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 9.18.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to F's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of F.\n\nF sticks out from TSLA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that F is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights General Motors, Tesla, ChargePoint, Blink Charging and Lion Electric",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 18, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors GM, Tesla TSLA, ChargePoint CHPT, Blink Charging BLNK and Lion Electric LEV.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nEV Roundup: Tesla's Musk Gets His Big Payday & More\n\nIn an escalating trade dispute, the European Union (EU) imposed up to 38% additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). This move is part of the EU's broader strategy to protect its car industry, which supports millions of well-paid jobs and is critical to the region's economic stability.The EU's decision to slap China with higher tariffs follows a much more aggressive move by the United States last month.\n\nOn the news front, U.S. auto biggie General Motors trimmed its forecast for EV production and sales for 2024 amid cooling demand for the same.\n\nMeanwhile, in a show of enduring faith for the EV giant Tesla's visionary CEO, shareholders approved Elon Musk's hefty pay package, currently valued at more than $45 billion (composed of stock options) during the company's annual general meeting. Shareholders also voted in favor of the company's headquarters' shift from Delaware to Texas. In a separate development, Tesla is set to increase Model 3 prices in Europe due to potential higher tariffs by the EU on imported electric cars from China.\n\nEV charging company ChargePoint and Porsche Cars North America have collaborated to integrate CHPT's network into the Porsche Charging Service. CHPT's peer Blink Charging received \"In Process\" FedRAMP status for its EV charging. The manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, Lion Electric, got the final certification of its LionBattery HD battery pack.\n\nWhile BLNK currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), GM, TSLA, CHPT and LEV carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLast Week's Top Stories\n\nTesla is set to raise prices for its Model 3 in Europe starting July 1, 2024.Notices regarding the price hike have been posted on Tesla's websites in various European countries. The U.S. automaker has not disclosed the exact increase for the Model 3, which starts at $44,000 in Germany. In another development, shareholders voted in favor of Musk's massive pay package.The saga of Musk's pay package began in 2018 when it was first approved at a staggering $56 billion. However, earlier this year, a Delaware court invalidated it. This led to a fresh shareholder vote, which ultimately reaffirmed support for Musk.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving said that, Musk needs court approval to receive the compensation, and the legal dispute over the compensation plan is far from over. Legal experts predict that the resolution of the lawsuit could take months. But the vote has boosted Tesla's position in ongoing litigation.\n\nGeneral Motors is reducing its expected sales and production of all-electric vehicles for 2024 due to slower-than-anticipated U.S. adoption of EVs. The company now anticipates producing 200,000 to 250,000 all-electric vehicles this year, down from the previous estimate of 200,000 to 300,000. GM expects EVs to comprise 8% of U.S. sales industrywide this year, which is lower than many other auto analyst forecasts of around 10% for 2024.\n\nThe EVs will become profitable on a production basis once they reach 200,000 units, a milestone still expected in the fourth quarter. In May, the company sold more than 9,500 EVs in North America. In the first quarter, EV sales were 16,425 units, representing 2.8% of GM's overall sales.\n\nChargePoint has partnered with Porsche Cars North America (\"PCNA\") to integrate its network into the Porsche Charging Service. This collaboration will expand the number of available charging points for Porsche customers to more than 100,000 across North America. Timo Resch, president and CEO of PCNA, emphasized the partnership's role in broadening charging options and improving customer experience, especially with the upcoming releases of the Taycan and Macan Electric.\n\nThe My Porsche app will facilitate easy access to ChargePoint and partner stations, covering more than 75% of charging ports available to Porsche drivers. The integration is set to go live in the fourth quarter of 2024, aligning with Porsche's adoption of the North American Charging Standard.\n\nBlink has achieved the \"In Process\" designation from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for its EV charging solutions. This milestone is crucial as full accreditation will allow government agencies to contract with Blink or its federal resellers for networked EV charging. Blink anticipates achieving full FedRAMP compliance by the end of third-quarter 2024.\n\nFedRAMP ensures secure cloud services for federal agencies, which are committed to deploying 24,000 charging stations by 2035. Blink's CEO, Brendan Jones, emphasized the importance of providing reliable EV charging for government agencies, highlighting the company's readiness to support the federal transition to EVs.\n\nLion Electric has achieved final certification for its LionBattery HD, a heavy-duty lithium-ion battery pack designed for its electric trucks, ensuring compliance with stringent safety standards. These 105 kWh batteries will power the Lion8 Tractor, an all-electric Class 8 commercial truck unveiled at the ACT Expo in Las Vegas.\n\nThis certification follows the previous approval of the LionBattery MD pack for medium-duty trucks and school buses. Lion's facility, with a 1.7 gigawatt-hour annual capacity, can produce batteries for 5,000 vehicles per year. CEO Marc Bedard emphasized the company's commitment to innovation, safety and production efficiency, solidifying Lion Electric's standing in North America's transportation electrification.\n\nWhat's Next in the EV Space?\n\nStay tuned for the announcements of upcoming EV models and any important updates from the red-hot industry.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Silent Stocks Quietly Amassing Fortunes for Investors",
        "content": "Silent stocks will do a lot of the heavy lifting for portfolios in the background. Of course, these companies aren\u2019t the ones making headlines every day like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, silent companies are the ones that quietly compound over the years. These will help grow your portfolio in the long term. In other words, these stocks can help amass fortunes for investors without having to ever lift a finger.\n\nSo what constitutes a silent stock? Often these stocks do not get the same coverage as other more high-profile companies. They can be in industries that are not as sexy as things like AI or electric vehicles. Or they can be lesser-known companies that aren\u2019t always considered the leaders in their particular sectors. In this article, we chose three silent stocks that have provided excellent returns to shareholders so far this year. These three can quietly amass fortunes for investors over the next decade or more!\n\nArm Holdings plc (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a semiconductor company that provides chips and CPUs for AI. While this company may be in a trending industry, it has largely been left in the shadow of its older siblings. These include NVIDIA and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). ARM is a relatively new stock to the markets. Its one-yearanalyst price range starts at $55.95. It goes as high as $189.00, which implies a 20% upside from today\u2019s price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat makes Arm a special chip company? It is the leading provider of IP solutions for a wide range of different types of chips. These include CPUs, GPUs and NPUs. Arm\u2019s chips and its technology are more energy-efficient and low-cost than its peers. They are also used by companies worldwide to develop advanced technologies. Arm-designed chips are used to power most smartphones including Apple\u2019s iPhones.\u00a0As a testament to this companies fast growth, ARM is set to join the NASDAQ-100 index by mid June!\n\nWhile Arm\u2019s stock trades at a somewhat high premium, when compared to its industry forward earnings median, Arm trades at a lower multiple than peers like Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). For now, let these other companies keep the headlines, and allow Arm to silently amass a fortune for you in the shadows of the other chip giants.\n\nFreeport-McMoran (FCX) Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy Status\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking for another way to play the AI race without buying expensive chip stocks? Look no further than Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX),one of the largest copper miners in the world, and a leading supplier of raw materials for such AI chip manufacturing. Currently, FCX has an average price target of $50.84 and a high-end target of $55.96, implying a near 15% upside for the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile commodity-based companies may seem boring, copper will be one of the raw materials in high demand in the coming years. We\u2019ve already seen the metal hit fresh all-time highs last month on the excitement of rapidly accelerating data center demand. After all, copper is a vital component of semiconductors and wiring that is used to connect data centers worldwide. Just this past year, this silent stock has already returned more than 14% to shareholders this year while paying a modest dividend yield of 0.62%.\n\nEven after gaining 14% this year, this stock is still sitting modestly below its sector median EV/EBIT ratio by around 12%. Any investor looking to jump on AI\u2019s demand fueled trend in a more diversified way should look at FCX as a candidate amassing long-term fortune.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF)  an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is another stock that has been silently outperforming the markets this year. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $208.08 and a high-end price target of $235.00 for ELF which implies a 25% upside from the stock\u2019s current price.\n\nThis beauty and cosmetics company just posted 77% year-over-year growth in net sales for the fiscal year 2024. It was the fifth consecutive year of sales growth for the company and has slowly but surely taken market share from larger brands. A key competitive moat for this company has been its success in promoting its product across social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest and Tik Tok, which has allowed it to strengthen brand loyalty amongst younger shoppers.\n\nAfter its rally this year, this stock\u2019s earnings and sales ratio are a bit pricier than its five-year average. Thankfully, when looking at its PEG to account for growth, ELF is only barely sitting above its sector median. While this is currently justified by its stellar growth as of recent, this company can be a sure bet in the cosmetic industry as a silent compounder to add to any diversified portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) companies are in uncharted territory. A few years ago, the market was anticipated to see a bustling demand for this new technology. However, the current reality in this market paints an unsettling picture for some in the industry. Many companies are seeing tepid demand, layoffs and the call to scale back on production. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t good picks for EV stocks to buy right now.\n\nCompanies that are surviving or thriving despite this slump are those that have diversified their offerings either alone or by collaboration with other automakers. But in some cases, a few of these companies are somehow powering through the slump and posting great sales.\n\nOther companies\u2019 stocks that can be described as EV-adjacent are better positioned than pure-play EV stocks at the moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are some of the best EV stocks to buy now.\n\nXpeng (XPEV) The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV Stock\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock\n\nWith a market cap of $6.9 billion, Chinese EV maker XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) is a relatively small player in the EV market \u2014 but it is holding its own impressively and might be one of the best EV stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestor reaction was positive after the company turned a profit for Q1 and issued an optimistic guidance for second-quarter car sales. Xpeng\u2019s vehicle margin \u2014 a key profitability metric, jumped over eight percentage points in the first quarter. The company expects to sell at least 25% more units this quarter compared to last year.\n\nAlso, Xpeng is making more money per car and selling more cars overall.\u00a0Its average revenue per vehicle shot to $42,000, thanks to strong sales of the X9 model. This helped push gross margins up to 13% \u2014 a significant improvement from the previous year.\n\nThis success is partly due to its doubled revenue stream from technical services, such as its partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAF). Xpeng now expects to ship between 29,000 and 32,000 cars this quarter \u2014 which is a year-over-year (YOY) increase of up to 38%.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) An image of the silver logo for GM Global Headquarters being displayed in a building.\n\nSource: ehrlif / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) are up over 30% this year, which is a rarity if we\u2019re looking at other big players in the U.S. auto market. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motors (NYSE:F) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) have not seen nearly that level of success.\n\nGeneral Motors posted strong financial results for quarter one of 2024, with a profit of $2.97 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Revenue also grew by 7.6% YOY \u2014 reaching just over $43 billion and surpassing analyst predictions of $41.15 billion. Earnings per share came in at $2.62, which significantly topped Wall Street estimates of $2.13 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while other companies, such as Ford, are pivoting to hybrid cars thanks to a cooling in demand for their EVs, GM expects to ramp up production of its all-electric vehicles. The company is on track to produce between 200,000 to 300,000 units this year.\n\nIt also helps that GM shares have an overweight analyst recommendation per MarketWatch, which signals it\u2019s a good bet among EV stocks to buy this June.\n\nOnsemi (ON) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDue to the overall decline in EV stocks in recent years, some investors are looking to dip their toe into the next best thing in the EV space: semiconductors for the auto industry.\n\nOnsemi (NASDAQ:ON) supplies semiconductors and sensors for the automotive industry, and is one such company benefiting from this phenomenon. Shares rose in April after the Scottsdale, Arizona-based EV chips provider posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, ON is profitable. Its price shot by over 50% in the first three quarters of last year, unlike many pure-play EV stocks. Revenue in 2022 jumped 24% to $8.33 billion.\n\nAlso, while the overall stock market took a beating in 2022, ON was relatively unscathed. Its stock value dipped just 9%, compared to the Nasdaq tanking 33% during the same period.\n\nCurrently, analysts are generally bullish on Onsemi, with 18 \u201cbuy\u201d and 13 \u201coverweight\u201d ratings and only one \u201csell\u201d rating. For investors looking for an alternative to pure-play EV stocks, ON is one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here's How Much You Would've Lost If You Bought Dogecoin During Elon Musk's Appearance On SNL",
        "content": "Here's How Much You Would've Lost If You Bought Dogecoin During Elon Musk's Appearance On SNL\n\nDogecoin (DOGE), the king of meme coins, was launched in 2013 as a joke, combining two trending narratives at the time \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC) and the funny \"Doge\" meme. Elon Musk \u2014 the owner of SpaceX, Tesla and the X platform \u2014 has promoted DOGE, primarily through his presence on Twitter.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet? According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\nOn May 8, 2021, Musk made an iconic appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL) following his series of Dogecoin tweets. Leading up to Musk's SNL appearance, DOGE had an impressive 30-day rally (a 1,000% increase from $0.056 on April 7 to $0.731 on May 7). DOGE reached its all-time high price of $0.737 on May 8, driven by speculation of Musk\u2019s ability to send DOGE \"to the moon.\"\n\nDespite high expectations for the SNL segment, many viewers were left underwhelmed. Musk struggled to answer questions regarding Dogecoin's path and viability as a digital asset. Ultimately, Musk admitted to DOGE being \"a hustle,\" destroying the positive sentiment held by the DOGE community.\n\nMusk's SNL appearance quickly became a \"sell the news\" event per DOGE's chart. Within a few days following Musk's SNL appearance, DOGE's price decreased more than 40%, plummeting to $0.418. DOGE exhibited a steady downtrend over the next couple of months, falling to $0.162 by July 20, 2021, a drop of 77.5% from Musk's appearance.\n\nTrending: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing \u2013 investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\n\nThroughout the rest of 2022 until early 2024, DOGE remained dormant with minimal price action. The lowest DOGE reached during the bear market was just below five cents on June 18, 2022, over a 93% decrease from DOGE's peak. If you invested $1,000 on the day of Musk's SNL debut and sold at this low, you would have a mere $70 worth of DOGE.\n\nSince March 2024, DOGE has ranged between 12 and 22 cents, with an average price of $0.15, down over 79% since DOGE's peak. If you bought $1,000 worth of DOGE when Musk appeared on SNL and sold your DOGE at today's price, you would have only $210 \u2014 less than a quarter of your investment.\n\nAlthough DOGE is down significantly from its all-time highs, 2024 has been promising for DOGE, reaching prices not seen since 2021. Additionally, there are ongoing initiatives portrayed by Musk that could cause another DOGE rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst is the DOGE-1 moon mission \u2014 the launch of a satellite \"DOGE-1\" funded entirely by Dogecoin. Second is speculation of Dogecoin integration with X, as Musk has mentioned ambitious plans to transform X into a comprehensive financial platform. Currently, Musk is in the process of securing U.S. payment licenses, potentially allowing DOGE payments via X. If history repeats itself, these events could generate another massive rally.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Battery Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Battery stocks have been battered over recent months.\n\nFalling lithium prices due to oversupply, subdued demand in China and lackluster sales figures from the electric vehicle (EV) market have all contributed to the rare earth mineral\u2019s plummeting price. According to Koyfin, the price of lithium carbonate has fallen 68.8% over the past 12 months. While there was somewhat of a recovery in Q1 of 2024, it appears prices are back in free fall.\n\nDespite this big of macroeconomic news not being good for the overall battery market, the May consumer price index (CPI) report could turn out to have a silver lining. Not only did inflation cool more than most economists had expected, but costly items like new automotives as well as car insurance exhibited notable decreases in pricing pressure.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs inflation cools, interest rate cuts become more likely. This should make investors bullish not only on EVs but also on battery stocks. Let\u2019s examine three battery stocks with robust fundamentals as well as strong buy ratings from Wall Street.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nIf you have been following developments in the global EV market, it hard to not have heard of BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY). The Chinese EV maker has catapulted onto the global stage with a massive fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles that come with an amazing price tag. BYD surpassed EV pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in both global production and sales in 2024. And throughout 2024, BYD continues to increase sales and deliveries while its American counterpart has noticeably struggled.\n\nWhat most don\u2019t know is BYD had its start as a lithium-ion battery producer for a range of consumer products way before it entered the EV space. BYD remains a key supplier in the lithium-ion battery market. The EV maker seems to be constantly trading places with LG Energy as either the second or third largest battery producer in terms of market share.\n\nBYD has garnered 6 strong buy ratings from Wall Street institutions as well as 22 buy ratings from a host of other banks and brokers.\n\nSigma Lithium (LAC) a lithium ion battery. Lithium Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother company crucial to the lithium battery supply chain is Sigma Lithium (NASDAQ:SGML). However, Sigma Lithium is not a tech company or a developer of batteries per se. Rather, the firm mines lithium carbonate from out of ground and serves as a supplier of the critical rare earth mineral to a number of battery makers and automotive companies.\n\nSigma Lithium owns the Grota do Cirilo lithium mine in Brazil. At the project\u2019s inception, the mine was thought to have about 54.8 million tons of lithium in the form of hard rock spodumene. Recent updates from Sigma Lithium have revised that number upward to 77.0 million tons. With the increase in reserves, Sigma Lithium expects the mine to last for nearly 25 years. Moreover, once the mine is in its production phase, the miner plans for a 744 kilotons/year production target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lithium producer has two strong buy ratings from Wall Street and four buy ratings. Having fallen nearly 70% over the past twelve months, now may be the time to buy up shares.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1887, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is another influential chemicals company that plays a significant role in the battery space. The firm has a number of lithium brine and hard rock mining facilities across the globe, including Australia, Chile, China and the U.S.\n\nIn addition, Albemarle develops a variety of specialty chemicals for other sectors of the economy. Those companies are within petroleum refining, automotive and pharmaceuticals industries.\n\nUnfortunately, the company\u2019s outsized exposure to lithium has left its vulnerable to the lithium price. In Albemarle\u2019s Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024, revenue came\u00a0in line with expectations. However, it\u00a0but represented 38% year-over-year (YOY) decrease from the same period in 2023. Also, net income was less impressing, coming in at $2.4 million.\n\nDespite these short-term setbacks, Albemarle\u2019s long-term fundamentals remain intact. Therefore, the company\u2019s role in the battery supply chain should not go understated. ALB has garnered two strong buy ratings and 13 buy ratings from Wall Street firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Faraday Future (FFIE) Stock: To the Moon or Straight to Zero?",
        "content": "You could almost feel retail investors celebrating in late May after shares of electric vehicle maker Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (NASDAQ:FFIE) surged from 4 cents to $1.80. The stock briefly became the most researched stock on InvestorPlace.com, and social media sites made it sound as if the only direction FFIE could go was up.\n\nOf course, this simplifies the situation.\n\nCalling Faraday Future an \u201cEV maker\u201d is relatively generous, considering the firm built roughly 15 vehicles last year and sold just four. (It also leased six and has several more as finished goods on its balance sheet). \u201cEarly-stage EV startup\u201d is a more fitting term. As for research, most of our InvestorPlace.com writers have consistently warned readers to stay away from the firm for its \u201chigh risk and little reward profile.\u201d InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto goes even further, suggesting investors buy puts on the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese warnings have largely gone ignored, given the numerous call options remaining on the stock. The company also continues to be worth over $200 million on public markets.\n\nThat\u2019s because there is a grain of truth that Faraday Future might keep going up. Stocks are worth precisely what buyers are willing to pay, and history tells us that meme stocks can often see a \u201cdouble peak\u201d as latecomers jump in.\n\nThe Double Peak\n\nPerhaps the best example of resurging meme stocks is GameStop (NYSE:GME). In March 2021, shares of the videogame retailer spiked a second time after a new wave of speculators joined in. Unlike early investors, these latecomers cared little about the company\u2019s valuation or its underlying business. According to Google Trends, search volumes for \u201cGME\u201d overtook those of \u201cGameStop\u201d by almost a 2-to-1 ratio that month.\n\nIn other words, if people were making money on the ticker, why bother knowing anything more about the company?\n\nThe results are as you might expect. Shares of GameStop rebounded from a split-adjusted $10 that February to over $66 the following month.\n\nA similar story happened with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Here\u2019s the same chart with FFIE overlaid onto the popular meme stock. Few traders discussed the cinema chain\u2019s post-Covid-19 recovery during AMC\u2019s second peak. To these brave speculators, the stock became a symbol of an \u201cApe\u201d movement that would last long after AMC\u2019s 2021 surge.\n\nThe Single Peak\n\nMeanwhile, other meme stocks decline without ever catching a second wind. Consider BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD), which briefly tripled in 2023 after announcing it would use OpenAI tools to help create content\u2026\n\nStory continues\n\nOr Genius Group (NYSEMKT:GNS), a Singapore-based firm that popularized the idea of investigating naked short sellers after appointing a former FBI director to lead a task force\u2026\n\nIn both of these cases, the companies themselves were the ones driving headlines. Meme investors never seemed to get as truly committed and quickly forgot about these companies once the news cycle moved on. These meme stocks had far less time in the spotlight\u2026 and less sustained momentum as a result.\n\nFFIE Stock: To the Moon or Straight to Zero?\n\nThat\u2019s worrying news for Faraday Future, a firm that has seen excitement disappear almost as quickly as it began. Since mid-May, search volumes for \u201cFFIE\u201d have fallen 86%, while \u201cFaraday Future\u201d volumes have yet to pick up.\n\nSocial media boards have also lacked significant chatter about super-normal returns. The company has no equivalent of Keith Gill to share screenshots of multimillion-dollar profits. Reddit\u2019s r/FFIE subreddit \u2014 a social media forum \u2014 turns decidedly negative any day shares go down.\n\nMost worryingly, consumers seem apathetic about Faraday\u2019s cars despite glowing performance reviews. The company has roughly 300 non-binding, fully refundable preorders, which is a rounding error compared to the 10,000 reservation figures that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) once sported. Most people on the street would fail to recognize a photo of a flagship Faraday FF91 SUV.\n\nThese issues are compounded by Faraday\u2019s publicity-shy management. In 2022, the company fired its media-savvy co-founder, Jia Yueting, after a scathing short report called him a \u201csecurities fraudster.\u201d The company has yet to find a suitable replacement, and Jia has even come back as an unofficial (and unwelcome) spokesperson for the company.\n\nThat suggests investors will quickly forget this meme stock\u2019s recent rise and fall. Faraday Future remains too small to have made ripples in the stock market, and the scant amount of cash left on hand suggests the company won\u2019t last much longer as a going concern even if meme investors pump the stock again.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: Penny Stocks \u2014 How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Rags to Riches: 3 EV Stocks That Could Make Early Investors Rich",
        "content": "At one point, electric vehicles were seen as the next world-changing industry. It seemed inevitable that electric vehicle adoption would take over the automotive world. However, while many people have tended to lump together EV developments with the tech sector, it\u2019s important to remember that consumers ultimately drive EV success. Over the past few years, consumer sentiment has been challenged by inflation and EV companies have struggled as a result.\n\nNonetheless, beaten-down sectors like EV currently have long been a target of value investing. Even though EV stocks are being treated as if they are going out of business, in 2023, the total number of EVs on the road hit 40 million worldwide, representing one in every five cars sold. As consumer sentiment restrengthens and inflation gets under control, we\u2019re bound to see a new wave of EV buyers. Here are three EV stocks that are ready to take you from rags to riches!\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere may be no stock that exemplifies rag to riches more than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Over the past five years, shares of TSLA have returned over 1,100% to shareholders. Despite Tesla being one of the most widely covered stocks on Wall Street, analysts are all over the map with price targets. The stock has a one-year price target range of $22.86 to $320.00. Currently, it is trading at just below its average price target of $181.22.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla shareholders recently voted to provide CEO Elon Musk with a record-breaking payday. Musk will now be paid a $56 billion pay package as per the 2018 agreement with the company. What does this mean for the long term? Musk will now be incentivized to help bring Tesla to key milestones including revenue and income goals. In particular, its CyberCab event in August will be the first of many such milestones that shareholders will be looking forward to for renewed optimism and growth confirmation.\n\nAnother thing to note is how cheap Tesla\u2019s stock is right now. Shares are trading at 5.7x forward sales which is well below its five-year average of 9.2x. Putting your money into Elon Musk\u2019s hands has historically been a winning proposition, and for now, Musk looks to be staying on as the head of Tesla for the foreseeable future.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a legacy automaker that has long-term aspirations of being an all-electric company. This stock has historically been valued as just an automaker, unlike Tesla which prices in future growth of its AI and robotics segments. Currently, analysts agree that GM is an underpriced stock with a lofty average price target of $54.87 and a street-high price target of $96.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, why should you invest in GM for EV exposure? Well, not only does GM have a strong financial standing, but its also making heavy investments into EV technology. In fact, this year, GM expects to produce up to 300,000 electric vehicles! This number should continue to grow and take market share from GM\u2019s internal combustion engine offerings, essentially solidifying itself as a key EV manufacturing player.\n\nDespite its growth in EV production, GM continues to trade at a rock-bottom valuation. Shares of GM are trading at just 0.35x sales and 4.9x forward earnings. Both of these multiples are considerably lower than the five-year average for GM\u2019s stock. Investors looking to find an industry leader at all-time lows, look no further than GM as a future-looking EV leader.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nNot all EV investments are automakers. Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the world\u2019s largest lithium producer and a key part of the EV battery market. Wall Street analysts agree with how valuable Albemarle is to the industry. In fact, the high end of analyst\u2019s one-year price target\u2019s sit at $216, over 100% higher than its current price.\n\nThis company is the key supplier to EV makers like Tesla and Ford (NYSE:F) as well as countless other traditional non-EV car makers. While Albemarle has seen some pullback due to plunging lithium prices, their recent quarter has demonstrated that their financials are still on track. They even recently announced a 40-cent dividend, thus demonstrating its confidence in using its cash flow to bring shareholder value.\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s stock has been beaten down and has lost about 30% so far this year. This has provided an intriguing entry point for new investors. For example, ALB\u2019s 2.0x forward sales are currently sitting well below its five-year average of 3.9x. If you are bullish on EV stocks bringing you from rags to riches, then Albemarle needs to be at the top of your watchlist!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Column: Elon Musk thinks Tesla's investors love him. He's very wrong",
        "content": "Elon Musk won two big shareholder votes at Tesla on Thursday, but that may not be good for Tesla shareholders. (Britta Pedersen / Associated Press)\n\nNo one who has followed the career of that famously self-effacing and modest business leader Elon Musk could have expected him to boast openly about having secured approval from Tesla shareholders for two important initiatives: moving the company's state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware, and \"ratifying\" his massive 2018 compensation package after it was invalidated by a Delaware state judge.\n\nHa ha. Just kidding. The day before the votes were formally tallied and announced after the company's annual meeting Thursday, Musk telegraphed the results on X, formerly Twitter, the social media platform he owns.\n\nBoth resolutions \"are currently passing by wide margins,\" he tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \"Thanks for your support!!\" and bracketing that line with a quartet of valentine-red hearts.\n\nThe board should recognize the influence of the sword of Damocles hanging over shareholder heads: the outcome of any stockholder vote could well be seriously distorted by Musk\u2019s looming threat.\n\nLucian Bebchuk and Robert J. Jackson Jr.\n\nThursday evening, after the votes were in, he tweeted a photo of a cake with the iced legend \"Vox Populi, Vox Dei,\" a Latin phrase meaning \"the voice of the people is the voice of the gods,\" and appending the comment, \"Sending this cake to Delaware as a parting gift.\"\n\nThe Tesla board instantly executed the change of incorporation, which is evidently rooted in Musk's conviction that Texas courts, which have little experience in adjudicating corporate governance issues, will be more pliant in his hands than the very experienced Delaware judiciary.\n\nFrom all that, one might assume that the shareholder votes cleared the legal complexities erected around the 2018 compensation grant by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January.\n\nThat assumption may be wrong, according to several experts in corporate law. The idea that shareholders can retrospectively validate a corporate action overturned in Chancery Court is \"divorced from the realities of Delaware law,\" observed Charles M. Elson, one of he nation's recognized authorities on the topic, in a May 13 legal brief.\n\nThat may not be the only issue about Tesla and Musk that is arguably divorced from reality. By many objective standards, the electric vehicle maker is in a bad way. A grim story was told by its first-quarter results, released on April 23. The company disclosed its lowest automotive profit margin, 15.9%, in five years, a major decline from its peak of about 30% in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat reflected several rounds of price cuts to keep Tesla vehicles moving off the lots, resulting in a decline of $2.42 billion, or 13%, in auto sales during that quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter, down by 8.5% from the same quarter a year earlier. That includes deliveries of its most highly touted new model, the Cybertruck pickup, which has been ridiculed in the automotive press and on social media for its risibly blockheaded design and mechanical and cosmetic flaws.\n\nRead more:Column: A judge voids Musk's huge Tesla pay package as dishonest, and hoo boy, is Musk steamed\n\nTesla faces stiffer competitive headwinds than it has encountered at any other time in its history. These are coming not only from legacy automakers that are coming to market with hybrid and fully electric models, but the Chinese EV-maker BYD, which overtook Tesla in deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023, when it sold more than 526,000 all-electric vehicles compared with Tesla's 484,510 in the same period.\n\nMore troubling from Tesla's standpoint, BYD is taking steps to expand its market significantly beyond domestic drivers and into Europe and even the U.S.\n\nTesla also faces more shareholder discontent over Musk's role in the company. In the past, his image as a technological visionary was inextricably linked with Tesla's image and the appeal of its products; a Tesla without Musk at the helm was almost unimaginable. Investor confidence in his leadership was manifest; the share price closed on Nov. 1, 2021, at $407.36, when the company's market value peaked at a stupendous $1.2 trillion.\n\nSending this cake to Delaware as a parting gift \ud83d\ude18 pic.twitter.com/uLKE7LDSCW\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 14, 2024\n\nMore recently, Musk's reputation has waned among significant segments of the public, thanks to the increasingly strident, partisan, reactionary and antisemitic viewpoints he has expressed on X. Investors aren't especially happy about the company's waning prospects.\n\nThe shares are down by more than 54% from that peak close in 2021, by more than 33% from a year ago, and by nearly 25% year-to-date. As I write, Tesla's market value is less than $600 billion.\n\nOne issue roiling the investor cadre is whether Tesla is as important to Musk as it used to be. His corporate universe includes not only X, but SpaceX and an artificial intelligence company dubbed X.AI. Musk has on occasion poached talent and resources from Tesla to benefit his other companies.\n\nThe Tesla board has gone along with that, but not all investors feel so tolerant. Two individual shareholders and the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund sued over the practice on Thursday \u2014 filing the case in Delaware right under the wire before Tesla followed through on the reincorporation vote by making itself a Texas company.\n\nRead more:Column: Elon Musk comes around to blaming the Jews\n\nThey say they're irked because Musk had been touting Tesla as, in his own words, \"an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company\" and \"the biggest AI project on Earth.\" That's an indication that Musk wishes to capture for Tesla the superior price/earnings multiple enjoyed by high-tech and especially AI companies (at the moment) in comparison with car companies. But if he's shifting his AI efforts out of Tesla, that obviously won't wash.\n\nAnd he seems to be doing so. The plaintiffs observe that Musk has poached AI engineers from Tesla to work at X.AI \u2014 at least 11 former Tesla employees went over to the new company. Furthermore, according to a report by CNBC cited by the plaintiffs, Musk personally ordered Nvidia, the global leader in AI processing chips, to divert 12,000 units ordered by Tesla to X and X.AI instead, adding months to the delays in \"setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs\" to develop robots and self-driving vehicles.\n\nEven before the shareholder vote, Musk intimated by tweet that he might not be inclined to develop AI capabilities within Tesla, as opposed to at his other companies, unless the Tesla board granted him a 25% voting control of Tesla.\n\nThis isn't the first time Musk has treated the companies he controls, whether private or publicly-traded, all as arms of his personal satrapy. After taking over X (then Twitter) in 2022, he brought over Tesla engineers to rework the social media platform's software. And in 2016 he orchestrated a rescue of SolarCity, his failing solar power company, by merging it with Tesla. In that case, typically, his acolytes on both boards went along without objection and, evidently, without spending much time on analysis of the deal. (I've asked Tesla to comment on all these issues, but answers came there none.)\n\nThat brings us back to the compensation deal and Thursday's votes.\n\nIn her 201-page decision issued on Jan. 30, Chancellor McCormick rescinded the 2018 pay package on several grounds. She found that the unprecedentedly large $56-billion package was excessive.\n\nRead more:Column: Scientists used to love Twitter. Thanks to Elon Musk, they're giving up on it\n\nThat was especially so given the control Musk exercises over Tesla as its largest single stockholder (with 21.9% at the time of McCormick's ruling and 20.5% as of March 31) and through his personal relationships and influence over several ostensibly independent Tesla board members \u2014 relationships which, McCormick found, had not been adequately disclosed to shareholders voting on the pay package.\n\nMusk reacted to McCormick's ruling by proposing to take oversight of Tesla's government out of the Delaware Chancery Court's hands through a reincorporation in Texas. The Tesla board, which had changed somewhat since 2018 but was still supine toward Musk, also asked shareholders in effect to overturn McCormick's ruling by voting on the pay package again.\n\nIn setting up the second vote, the Tesla board didn't display much more inclination to examine the pay package than it had the first time around, when the process of developing the package was all but exclusively under Musk's control.\n\nThis time, the board established a special committee of two board members. But one resigned early on, and the board never replaced him. In other words, the special committee was a committee of one, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a former executive of Walgreens and Kellogg's. According to Tesla, the committee \"did not substantively reevaluate the amount or terms\" of the 2018 package \"and did not engage a compensation consultant.\"\n\nNor did the committee renegotiate the pay package with Musk. After all, the company said, the board had decided in 2018 that the package was \"fair\"; nothing had changed since 2018, so all that needed to happen in light of McCormick's ruling was that there be more disclosure of board relationships.\n\nIs that so?\n\nA lot has changed, obviously. To begin with, the 2018 package incorporated numerous incentive milestones that Musk would have to meet to receive any part of or even the full $56 billion. Tesla actually did reach those milestones, but what further incentives exist to keep Musk engaged into the future?\n\nMusk's threat to take his AI operations out of Tesla unless he receives more voting control obviously point to the need to keep him on board.\n\nRead more:Column: Robot taxis? Hyperloops? A top technologist wages war on tech's hype machine\n\n\"Stockholders should know whether the board\u2019s request for a vote is motivated by the threat \u2014 and what, if anything, the board plans to do about Musk\u2019s threat if he attempts to carry it out,\" wrote corporate governance experts Lucian Bebchuk and Robert J. Jackson Jr. prior to Thursday's vote. \"Strikingly, the board hasn\u2019t conditioned holding the vote on Musk withdrawing his threat or committing not to carry it out if stockholders vote to approve.\"\n\nThey add, \"the board should recognize the influence of the sword of Damocles hanging over shareholder heads: the outcome of any stockholder vote could well be seriously distorted by Musk\u2019s looming threat.\"\n\nThe Tesla board, therefore, has once again behaved as Musk's cat's-paw. That's not surprising, since the board is nothing like truly independent. Its eight members include Musk, his brother Kimball, his longtime friends Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch (a son of Rupert Murdoch), former Tesla executive and former SolarCity board member J. B. Straubel and, as chair, Robyn M. Denholm, who testified that the wealth she has collected as a Tesla director has been \"life-changing.\"\n\nMcCormick found that although Denholm didn't have a personal relationship with Musk, her dependence on Tesla almost exclusively as a source of her personal wealth might have compromised her judgment in approving the 2018 package and contributed to her \"lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations.\"\n\nSo assuming that the Delaware court won't step in again to rescind the pay package, Musk is once again getting all he wants from Tesla, with even fewer incentives to perform for the future than he has had in the past.\n\nGood for him. But if Tesla continues its recent decline in market value, its non-Musk shareholders will have no one to blame but its board, and themselves.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Hyunjoo Jin\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees on Monday that the electric vehicle maker is working on stock-based compensation for high-performing employees, according to two people who reviewed an internal memo.\n\nThe plan comes just days after Musk won shareholder approval for his $56 billion pay plan consisting of stock options and two months after he announced job cuts affecting more than 10% of Tesla's global workforce in the face of slowing demand for EVs and intensifying price competition from Chinese rivals.\n\n\"Over the next few weeks, Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock option grants for exceptional performance,\" Musk said in an email, according to the two people who reviewed it and are based in China and the U.S., respectively. They declined to be named as the memo is for internal use.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There will also be an ongoing program to award spot option grants for anyone who does something outstanding for the company. Thanks for everything you're doing to make Tesla successful,\" the email said.\n\nTesla did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nTesla last year skipped merit-based stock awards to employees, people familiar with the matter said. Tesla's margins took a hit last year from the company's aggressive price cuts aimed to revive demand and fend off competition.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Tesla shares have slumped 25% and the EV maker has warned of sharp slowdown in sales.\n\n(Reporting by Zhang Yan in Shanghai and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)",

        "title": "Retail sales ahead, Tesla's legal fight over Musk pay deal - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were broadly flat on Tuesday following a rally on Wall Street in the previous session that brought the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite up to new record-high closing levels. Monthly retail sales figures are due to be a key focus for investors, as they attempt to assess the state of the U.S. economy. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) begins a legal fight in Delaware over CEO Elon Musk's historic $56 billion pay package after the electric vehicle group's shareholders widely backed the compensation deal last week.\n\n1. Futures broadly flat\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline on Tuesday, as traders prepared for the release of key retail sales data.\n\nBy 03:13 ET (07:13 GMT), the Dow futures contract had edged higher by 30 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both widely unchanged.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street jumped in the prior session, with the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posting fresh record closing highs. Sentiment was boosted by analysts at Goldman Sachs and Evercore ISI both raising their year-end targets for the S&P 500.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) extended a rally that began last week after the iPhone-maker unveiled a raft of artificial intelligence-enhanced features at its annual developers conference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which tracks shares of chipmaking firms, touched an all-time peak, reflecting ongoing enthusiasm around the applications of AI. U.S.-listed shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company -- the world's biggest contract chip supplier -- climbed 5.4%, while memory chip company Micron (NASDAQ:MU) also advanced following price-target upgrades by brokerages.\n\n2. Retail sales ahead\n\nThe momentum of U.S. consumer spending is projected to have sped up in May, pointing to resilience in a crucial section of the American economy.\n\nEconomists expect that retail sales grew by 0.3% on a month-on-month basis. The number would be an acceleration from 0.0% in April, when expenditures on many goods were tempered by elevated gasoline prices.\n\nDespite facing headwinds from sticky inflation and a steep uptick in interest rates, U.S. sales have largely remained strong thanks in part to a solid labor market. Consumers have chosen to focus much of their spending on essential items in response to these pressures, foregoing many purchases on pricier luxury goods.\n\nThe data may provide more insight into the state of the overall economy, which could impact how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate reductions later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Monday, Philadephia Fed President Patrick Harker backed one 25-basis point cut in 2024, citing signs of easing but above-trend economic activity, some slackening in labor demand, and an ongoing slowdown in inflation. His comments echoed a median rate forecast for the rest of the year that was released by policymakers on Wednesday.\n\n3. Tesla opens legal fight in Delaware to reinstate Musk pay package\n\nTesla has initiated its battle for legal recognition of Chief Executive Elon Musk's massive $56 billion pay package after the electric carmaking giant's shareholders voted in favor of the compensation agreement.\n\nDelaware judge Kathaleen McCormick (NYSE:MKC) previously voided the pay earlier this year, calling the amount -- a record in U.S. corporate history -- \"unfathomable\" and raising doubts around the independence of the company's board.\n\nBut Musk's deal, as well as a plan to reincorporate Tesla in Texas from Delaware, received the support of 77% of the shareholder votes cast last week, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nIn a letter made available to the public on Monday, Tesla attorneys argued that the shareholder decision \"significantly impacts\" McCormick's prior ruling.\n\nHowever, Greg Varallo, a shareholder attorney against the pay package, said the ratification had \"no legal effect\" on the case, Reuters reported.\n\n4. Apple scraps \"buy now, pay later\" scheme\n\nApple has scrapped its \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) service in the U.S., bringing an end to the offering only a little over a year after it was first announced.\n\nThe California-based group's \"Apple Pay Later\" allowed users to purchase items in installments, rather than buying them in one up-front sum. The move, which was initially unveiled last March, was viewed as a push by Apple into a financial services space dominated by companies like Klarna and Affirm.\n\nBut Apple said it was now focusing on providing access to installment loans through third-party credit, debit cards and lenders. Apple said \"the solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe.\"\n\nCustomers with open loans on Apple's BNPL service will still be able to manage and pay for them via its Wallet app, the company said.\n\n5. Oil dips\n\nCrude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session\u2019s gains, as the global demand outlook remains uncertain amid plentiful supply.\n\nBy 03:11 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $79.56 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $84.09 a barrel. Both benchmarks added around 2% on Monday, closing at their highest since April.\n\nData released earlier this week showed that China, the world\u2019s largest crude importer, was struggling to produce a solid economic recovery. Meanwhile, worries persist that the U.S. economy's prolonged exposure to high interest rates could weigh on crude demand in the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRetail sales ahead, Tesla's legal fight over Musk pay deal - what's moving markets\n\nAustralia's central bank stays the course on rates, alert to inflation risks\n\nUkraine's international bond rework derailed as deadline nears\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Indonesia\u2019s $5 billion deal with Tesla is only part of its all-in strategy on nickel mining",
        "content": "In mid-2020, an exasperated Elon Musk appealed for greater access to a commodity crucial to electric-vehicle battery production. \u201cAny mining companies out there, please mine more nickel, okay?\u201d he said on an earnings call. \u201cTesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.\u201d\n\nThe Tesla CEO soon found a supplier that could fulfill at least part of his request. In 2022, the EV maker struck a $5 billion deal to source nickel from Indonesia. The Muslim-majority archipelago of 280 million people has a landmass three times the size of Texas, scattered across an island chain spanning a distance comparable to that between San Francisco and Bermuda in the mid-Atlantic. Buried beneath its mangroves, ancient rainforests, and active volcanoes is the world\u2019s largest reserve of nickel: 42% of the global supply. The metallic element is a component crucial to rechargeable batteries\u2014including those in EVs\u2014and to the world\u2019s overall green transition.\n\nAs the EV sector has boomed, Indonesia\u2019s government has sought to leverage this stockpile to jump-start its high-value manufacturing sector and stoke its economy. The strategy has already proved lucrative, but cashing in on the sought-after resource comes with challenges: Extracting it from the earth is a dirty, dangerous business. And sagging sales of EVs worldwide suggest that nickel, the resource one of the world\u2019s richest men begged for a few years ago, may not be an easy pathway to prosperity.\n\nEver since Dutch colonists first discovered nickel in Indonesia in the early 1900s, it\u2019s been at the center of battles over who gets to mine and sell it. In the past decade, the Indonesian government has set out an ambitious development plan that would give it definitive control over nickel and other commodities.\n\nThe government\u2019s first step in capturing more of the nickel value chain was banning exports of the raw metal, which Indonesia first did in 2014. That means nickel isn\u2019t just mined in Indonesia; it\u2019s now refined in the country before it\u2019s sent elsewhere. The result is clear: The value of Indonesia\u2019s nickel exports has exploded from $1.06\u00a0billion in 2014 to almost $6\u00a0billion in 2022, according to United Nations data. Nickel prices have steadily appreciated in recent years, more than doubling to $21,690 per tonne from a historic low in 2016.\n\nThe government of President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who takes office in October, is likely to follow up with a second step in the development plan: a ban on the export of refined nickel, which would encourage manufacturers to set up factories in Indonesia. Companies including LG and Hyundai have already built battery and EV production facilities in the country.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy supplying a key component to EVs, Indonesia has landed squarely in the middle of an intensifying rivalry between China and the U.S. So far the government in Jakarta has struck a delicate balance between the two superpowers. China has invested $17.2 billion in Indonesia\u2019s metals sector since 2006, recently pouring money into local refining capacity, according to the American Enterprise Institute. An additional $10 billion is in the pipeline. \u201cIndonesia has grabbed Chinese attention because it appears to be the best metals choice at scale,\u201d says Derek Scissors, senior fellow at the institute. At the same time, as a neutral country in the U.S.-China rift, Indonesia hopes it will be able to funnel vast quantities of commodities to both nations\u2014even if its refiners are funded by Chinese money.\n\n\u201cIndonesia has grabbed Chinese attention because it appears to be the best metals choice at scale.\u201d\n\nDerek Scissors, American Enterprise Institute\n\nIndonesia has attempted to replicate its nickel strategy with export bans on other minerals like bauxite, copper, and tin. Udith Sikand of Gavekal Research is skeptical Jakarta can repeat its nickel success. Indonesia has a \u201cnear stranglehold\u201d on nickel production, he says, but \u201cfaces a much more competitive landscape\u201d for the other metals. There are plenty of alternative countries where companies can source their supplies.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s cornering of commodities is intended to boost the fortunes of homegrown firms like Amman Mineral Internasional, Harita Nickel, Merdeka Copper Gold, and Merdeka Battery Materials, all of which appear on the inaugural Fortune Southeast Asia 500 list this year. Prabowo has vowed to deliver annual economic growth of 8%. In the first quarter of 2024, Indonesia GDP grew 5.11%, surpassing estimates.\n\nStill, continued growth is not guaranteed. Indonesia\u2019s nickel push is under threat for the risks it poses to the environment and the people mining and refining the resource.\n\nIndonesia has largely failed, critics say, to uphold the latter part of Musk\u2019s plea\u2014to \u201cmine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.\u201d Incumbent president Joko Widodo had pledged to improve environmental standards in the industry, which is associated with deforestation and air and water pollution. But Didit Wicaksono, climate and energy manager at Greenpeace Indonesia, says that global demand for EVs has been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d by the government and \u201cused to justify exploiting nickel as a critical mineral commodity supporting the electric-car industry, causing extraordinary environmental impacts and damage.\u201d The government is fueling the development with coal, he adds, which will leave the country short of its emissions targets.\n\nAnd on occasion, nickel mining has proved deadly. In December, an explosion at a refinery owned by Tesla supplier Tsingshan, a Chinese commodities giant, killed 21 workers and injured dozens more. (The two firms did not respond to requests for comment.) Indonesian police have since brought charges of criminal negligence against two Chinese nationals.\n\nThe strongest headwind, however, may be the struggling EV industry. Price cuts across the sector \u201care signaling that the market is saturated,\u201d says Jesse Kuri of BCA Research.\n\nFor now, though, Indonesia is charging ahead. When Musk visited Jakarta in late May to launch Starlink services, the government proposed that Tesla construct an electric-vehicle battery plant in the country. An official in charge of investment told reporters the Tesla boss said he would consider the offer, but Musk himself has given no comment.\n\nThis article appears in the June/July 2024 Asia issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cHas Indonesia hit the nickel jackpot?\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Blake Brittain\n\n(Reuters) - Tesla has sued its former supplier Matthews International in California federal court for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to Tesla's battery-manufacturing process and sharing them with the electric-vehicle giant's competitors.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said Matthews owes damages that Tesla \"conservatively estimates will exceed $1 billion\" for misusing company trade secrets related to dry electrode battery manufacturing technology.\n\nSpokespeople for Matthews and attorneys and spokespeople for Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPittsburgh-based Matthews began supplying Tesla with manufacturing machinery in 2019, according to the complaint. Tesla said it shared secrets with Matthews related to dry-electrode coating, which the carmaker has said can dramatically reduce the size, cost, energy consumption and production cycle time of battery manufacturing plants while boosting the energy density and power of battery cells.\n\nThe lawsuit said Matthews shared Tesla's innovations with unnamed competitors by selling \"machines and other technologies embodying Tesla's trade secrets.\" It also said Matthews claimed Tesla's inventions as its own in patent filings that have revealed confidential Tesla information.\n\nTesla asked the court to block Matthews from misusing its trade secrets and hand over its patent applications in addition to requesting monetary damages.\n\n(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by David Bario and Nick Zieminski)",

        "content": "By Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Tesla began its fight for legal recognition of a shareholder vote favoring Elon Musk's record compensation, telling a Delaware judge that it \"significantly impacts\" her ruling voiding the pay, according to a letter made public on Monday.\n\nTesla wrote to Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick that the parties in the pay package case should now lay out their legal interpretations of Thursday's ratification of Musk's pay, rather than moving ahead with the case on the prior schedule.\n\n\"The approval of ratification by Tesla\u2019s stockholders significantly impacts the claims and issues in this action, including the court\u2019s final judgment,\" Tesla attorneys told McCormick in the letter, which was filed with the Court of Chancery on Friday.\n\nGreg Varallo, a shareholder attorney in the case against the pay package, said the ratification had \"no legal effect\" on the case and that he would explain his argument in a brief due Friday.\n\nTesla has said the ratification process was \"novel\" and it was unclear if McCormick and the Delaware Supreme Court would accept the result.\n\nTesla has argued that the ratification has now cured the problems raised in McCormick's ruling in January.\n\nThe judge found Musk controlled the 2018 process that led to the pay package and that Tesla concealed key information from shareholders about the ease of the targets the company had to meet for Musk to be paid.\n\nA special committee of its board reviewed the pay package and determine it was in the best interest of shareholders, which Tesla said fixed the problem of Musk's dominance in the process.\n\nThe vote was corrected by providing shareholders hundreds of pages of added disclosures, including McCormick's 200-page opinion.\n\nMcCormick also has to determine a fee for the shareholder legal team before Tesla can appeal her ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nThe shareholder's attorneys are seeking around $5 billion, in the form of Tesla stock as a legal fee and Tesla argued they should be paid around $13.6 million.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware, Editing by Franklin Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Beijing recently 'greenlighted' Tesla the ability to roll out its driver-assistance system, known as \"Full Self-Driving,\" or FSD. A new report suggests Tesla is testing vehicles equipped with FSD on city streets and highways in the world's largest car market.\n\nReuters cited a report from the government-backed Shanghai Observer that said ten Tesla vehicles with FSD are being tested ahead of what could be a much larger planned rollout later this year.\n\nElon Musk has been strategically paving the way for an FSD rollout in China in recent months. His surprise visit to China on April 28, where he met with top Chinese officials, including Premier Li Qiang, clearly indicated Tesla's deepening ties with China.\n\nOne day later, on April 29, news broke in US corporate media that Tesla would partner with Chinese tech giant Baidu for mapping and navigation software to support FSD, including satisfying regulators about data security and privacy requirements. Other reports said top Chinese officials gave Musk the greenlight to roll out FSD in some limited capacity.\n\nIn May, Reuters reported that Tesla was preparing to register FSD with Chinese authorities for a planned rollout later this year. Chinese state media also stated that Tesla had begun building a Megapack factory in Shanghai.\n\nThe larger rollout of FSD in China will be a golden opportunity for Tesla to expand revenue streams amid the worldwide slump in EV sales. Also, this allows them to better compete with local rivals in China.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nOil Drops on Inventory Build Inflation in China is Finally Beginning to Stabilize 80 More Years of Oil: The Big Attraction of Carbon Capture\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If nothing else, analyst ratings and price targets can provide an indication of sentiment towards a stock. However, just because analysts are bullish or bearish on a particular security doesn\u2019t mean that it is going to rise or fall. On the contrary, some of the best stocks to buy often run counter to the consensus views of Wall Street analysts, much to their frustration.\n\nFor years, analysts were bearish on electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the stock was the most heavily shorted on Wall Street. Critics were concerned about the valuation of TSLA stock and the high multiple at which it traded. However, Tesla\u2019s stock kept on rising no matter how many bears circled the company. Tesla\u2019s share price is down today, but that\u2019s mostly due to declining sales rather than worries about valuation.\n\nHere are other contrarian delights: three stocks defying analyst expectations for massive gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is currently a consensus \u201chold\u201d rating on Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock. A dozen Wall Street analysts have a median price target on PLTR stock that is 5% lower than where the shares are currently trading. Among the 12 analysts, only two rate the stock a \u201cbuy.\u201d Valuation seems to be the main concern with Palantir stock trading at 196 times future earnings estimates.\n\nYet the negative sentiment among analysts hasn\u2019t held PLTR stock back. So far in 2024, the company\u2019s share price has risen 40%. The stock is up 154% since its initial public offering in late 2020. Palantir\u2019s stock has gotten a boost from a string of strong financial reports. The company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters, making it eligible for inclusion in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that has a \u201chold\u201d rating is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). Among eight Wall Street analysts that offer price targets on the shares, only two rate the stock a \u201cbuy.\u201d NextEra is the world\u2019s largest electric utility by market capitalization, with a valuation of $150 billion. The downbeat rating on NEE stock is a bit surprising given its run this year and the generally bullish sentiment among investors toward utility stocks right now.\n\nSince January, NEE stock has gained 20%, closing in on a 52-week high. The stock also doesn\u2019t look overvalued trading at 19 times future earnings estimates. And it offers a chunky dividend of 51 cents per share each quarter, giving it a yield of 2.8%. In this case, analysts expressed concerns about surplus energy products and waning long-term demand, which could pull down NextEra stock. That hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe New York Times Co. (NYT) The headquarters of the New York Times (NYT) at night.\n\nSource: Osugi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe paper of record currently rates a \u201cmoderate buy\u201d among analysts with a median price target right around where the stock of The New York Times Co. (NYSE:NYT) is currently trading. Much hand-wringing is going on over the future impact that artificial intelligence will have on The New York Times and other newspapers. Some analysts have said that the media industry as we know it is toast with the advent of AI.\n\nThe New York Times is happily defying analyst expectations. In the past 12 months, NYT stock has risen 33% and is also hovering near a 52-week high. The company continues posting decent earnings, and its digital subscriptions are steadily growing. At last tally, the media company had 10.55 million subscribers across its print and digital products, of which 9.91 million were digital-only subscribers. The company continues adding popular content, such as more sports coverage, games and recipes to its offerings.\n\nThe New York Times is one of the few media companies that is profitable from its digital subscriptions alone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nTesla is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.47 points to a change of -20.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 indicates a change of +31.5% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $24.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.1%. The $98.56 billion and $111.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +13.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTesla reported revenues of $21.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.85 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.83%. The EPS surprise was -2.17%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Even as inflation gradually cools off, there is one price rise affecting corporate America that knows no end in sight\u2014the ever-rising cost of paying top executives.\n\nDespite more than a decade of controversy, median CEO compensation at the 500 largest S&P companies increased at its highest pace in at least 14 years in 2023 according to figures from Institutional Shareholder Services\u00a0cited by the Financial Times on Sunday.\n\nThe debate over high CEO pay in America has raged for years, as proponents argue the free market sets the level while critics claim it is untethered from reality given that U.S. executives' peers in fellow industrialized nations earn a fraction of what they take home.\n\nData from Equilar published\u00a0earlier this month declared Jon Winkelreid from private equity firm TPG the best-paid executive in America, taking in nearly $200 million in total compensation, while the top five in its ranking all earned a minimum of $150 million each. Many Americans are no longer willing to countenance these kind of rewards, as wages adjusted for inflation stagnated for decades before the recent bout of high inflation both pushed up wages and strained their finances.\n\nThis controversy has taken on new dimensions amid Elon Musk\u2019s campaign to \u201crestore Tesla\u2019s stockholder democracy\u201d by ratifying his 2018 pay package. Comprised of stock options with deeply discounted strike price, it\u2019s worth on balance nearly $8 billion per year.\n\nA decade ago the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger, pushed back against the idea that massive pay was sometimes justified in order to sufficiently incentivize executives.\n\n\u201cDo you really think that a man who craves power and significance, likes decision-making and running a big company, has one of the important public ranks in America and makes $5 million a year\u2014do you really think he would work a lot more effectively if you raise him to seven?\u201d Munger told CNN\u00a0in 2014. \u201cI think the whole thing is insane.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, Berkshire\u2019s CEO, Warren Buffett, earned only $100,000 in annual salary over the past 40 years with total compensation barely reaching the half-million mark, SEC filings\u00a0analyzed by Business Insider showed in December.\n\nBoard directors and high CEO pay\n\nMunger argued the system had an inherent flaw: With high compensation for non-executive directors in exchange for their cushy and lucrative seats on corporate boards, these individuals were often happy to grant ever larger CEO compensation deals\u2014\u201ca daisy chain of reciprocity,\u201d as he saw it.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne such person who could fit Munger's characterization is Robyn Denholm, who attested in court to the \u201clife-changing\u201d wealth she accumulated as the chair of Tesla\u2019s\u00a0oft-maligned board full of Musk\u2019s friends and family.\n\nOver the past month, the Australian emerged from her role in the background to mount a veritable media blitz lobbying for CEO Elon Musk\u2019s pay deal\u2014dubbed the\u00a0largest in human history.\n\nIn 2018, shareholders granted the board\u2019s request to give Musk the right to purchase up to 304 million shares for a price of $23.34 each\u2014which in theory would net him $47 billion were he to exercise the options and subsequently sell the stock at its current $178 price\u2014if the company hit over a dozen targets ranging from market capitalization to revenue and earnings. Every single one was met, according to Tesla, amply rewarding shareholders\u2014of which Musk is by far the biggest.\n\nThis package was declared null and void in January by a\u00a0Delaware court due to the fact that Denholm and her fellow directors allowed Musk to set the terms himself. This lenient board governance, however, left the very real possibility that he effectively would not be rewarded at all for his past six years of labor.\n\nAs chair responsible for the situation, Denholm argued it was only fair shareholders re-approve Musk's pay in\u00a0last week\u2019s crunch vote. \u201cPut yourself in his shoes,\u201d she urged earlier this month. \"[It's] really about fairness\u2014fairness to our CEO.\"\n\nThe asset management company T. Rowe Price\u2014one of Tesla's top 10 investors\u2014followed a similar line in a statement before the vote: \"It is not reasonable for investors to\u2026consider all that value creation to have been delivered to us for no consideration.\"\n\nWhether it was their arguments or fear that Musk might resign without a clear succession plan, nearly three in four votes cast by\u00a0disinterested shareholders followed Denholm's wishes and approved the plan again.\n\nMusk\u2019s pay may be an outlier, but the trend towards massive CEO pay in the U.S. has been clear for years. The\u00a0latest annual figures from trade union AFL-CIO revealed the average CEO at the 500 largest S&P companies hauled in $16.7 million in 2022. That means it would take workers 272 years to make what their chief executives earn annually.\n\nBy comparison, an analysis of 328 European and U.K. blue chips by executive compensation consultants WTW, formerly Willis Towers Watson, showed that their CEOs' pay rose 7% to almost \u20ac4 million last year\u2014a sizable sum, but a small fraction of their U.S. peers'.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "EV Roundup: TSLA Shareholders Back Musk's Pay, GM Trims 2024 EV Outlook &amp; More",
        "content": "In an escalating trade dispute, the European Union (EU) imposed up to 38% additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). This move is part of the EU's broader strategy to protect its car industry, which supports millions of well-paid jobs and is critical to the region's economic stability.The EU\u2019s decision to slap China with higher tariffs follows a much more aggressive move by the United States last month.\n\nOn the news front, U.S. auto biggie General Motors GM trimmed its forecast for EV production and sales for 2024 amid cooling demand for the same.\n\nMeanwhile, in a show of enduring faith for the EV giant\u00a0Tesla\u2019s TSLA visionary CEO, shareholders approved Elon Musk\u2019s hefty pay package, currently valued at more than $45 billion (composed of stock options) during the company\u2019s annual general meeting.\u00a0Shareholders also voted in favor of the company\u2019s headquarters\u2019 shift from Delaware to Texas. In a separate development, Tesla is set to increase Model 3 prices in Europe due to potential higher tariffs by the EU on imported electric cars from China.\n\nEV charging company ChargePoint CHPT and Porsche Cars North America have collaborated to integrate CHPT's network into the Porsche Charging Service. CHPT\u2019s peer Blink Charging BLNK received \"In Process\" FedRAMP status for its EV charging. The manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, Lion Electric LEV, got the final certification of its LionBattery HD battery pack.\n\nWhile BLNK currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), GM, TSLA, CHPT and LEV carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLast Week\u2019s Top Stories\n\nTesla is set to raise prices for its Model 3 in Europe starting Jul 1, 2024.Notices regarding the price hike have been posted on Tesla\u2019s websites in various European countries. The U.S. automaker has not disclosed the exact increase for the Model 3, which starts at $44,000 in Germany. In another development, shareholders voted in favor of Musk\u2019s massive pay package.The saga of Musk\u2019s pay package began in 2018 when it was first approved at a staggering $56 billion. However, earlier this year, a Delaware court invalidated it. This led to a fresh shareholder vote, which ultimately reaffirmed support for Musk.\n\nHaving said that, Musk needs court approval to receive the compensation, and the legal dispute over the compensation plan is far from over. Legal experts predict that the resolution of the lawsuit could take months. But the vote has boosted Tesla's position in ongoing litigation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors is reducing its expected sales and production of all-electric vehicles for 2024 due to slower-than-anticipated U.S. adoption of EVs. The company now anticipates producing 200,000 to 250,000 all-electric vehicles this year, down from the previous estimate of 200,000 to 300,000. GM expects EVs to comprise 8% of U.S. sales industrywide this year, which is lower than many other auto analyst forecasts of around 10% for 2024.\n\nThe EVs will become profitable on a production basis once they reach 200,000 units, a milestone still expected in the fourth quarter. In May, the company sold more than 9,500 EVs in North America. In the first quarter, EV sales were 16,425 units, representing 2.8% of GM's overall sales.\n\nChargePoint has partnered with Porsche Cars North America (\u201cPCNA\u201d) to integrate its network into the Porsche Charging Service. This collaboration will expand the number of available charging points for Porsche customers to more than 100,000 across North America. Timo Resch, president and CEO of PCNA, emphasized the partnership's role in broadening charging options and improving customer experience, especially with the upcoming releases of the Taycan and Macan Electric.\n\nThe My Porsche app will facilitate easy access to ChargePoint and partner stations, covering more than 75% of charging ports available to Porsche drivers. The integration is set to go live in the fourth quarter of 2024, aligning with Porsche\u2019s adoption of the North American Charging Standard.\n\nBlink has achieved the \"In Process\" designation from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for its EV charging solutions. This milestone is crucial as full accreditation will allow government agencies to contract with Blink or its federal resellers for networked EV charging. Blink anticipates achieving full FedRAMP compliance by the end of third-quarter 2024.\n\nFedRAMP ensures secure cloud services for federal agencies, which are committed to deploying 24,000 charging stations by 2035. Blink\u2019s CEO, Brendan Jones, emphasized the importance of providing reliable EV charging for government agencies, highlighting the company's readiness to support the federal transition to EVs.\n\nLion Electric has achieved final certification for its LionBattery HD, a heavy-duty lithium-ion battery pack designed for its electric trucks, ensuring compliance with stringent safety standards. These 105 kWh batteries will power the Lion8 Tractor, an all-electric Class 8 commercial truck unveiled at the ACT Expo in Las Vegas.\n\nThis certification follows the previous approval of the LionBattery MD pack for medium-duty trucks and school buses. Lion\u2019s facility, with a 1.7 gigawatt-hour annual capacity, can produce batteries for 5,000 vehicles per year. CEO Marc Bedard emphasized the company's commitment to innovation, safety and production efficiency, solidifying Lion Electric\u2019s standing in North America's transportation electrification.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major EV players over the last week and six-month period.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\n\u2018AI stands for Apple Intelligence:\u2019 D.A. Davidson upgrades Apple to Buy\n\nAnalysts at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock from Neutral to Buy this week after the iPhone maker introduced its much-anticipated AI strategy.\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s analysts, \u201cAI now stands for Apple Intelligence,\u201d which is the name of the company\u2019s artificial intelligence platform unveiled at the WWDC event.\n\nD.A. Davidson also lifted their price target from $200 to $230.\n\n\"Another Napster to iTunes moment. We believe yesterday's presentation rhymes with one of Apple's previous milestone moments \u2014 the transition of digital music from a standalone app with questionable regulatory standing (i.e. Napster) to an experience integrated into existing consumer applications (i.e. iTunes),\u201d analysts wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe the integration of summarization, enhanced search, multi-modality, text generation, and enhanced photo editing into the exiting ecosystem will drive much broader adoption of AI than we have seen to date,\u201d they added.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted that Apple is the first to introduce a meaningful agent capability, allowing Siri and other tools to execute tasks on behalf of the user. Moreover, they emphasize that Apple is uniquely positioned to offer these capabilities and \u201cmay be the only one capable of doing so any time soon.\u201d\n\nAMD downgraded as Morgan Stanley favors Nvidia, Broadcom\n\nMeanwhile, AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) got a downgrade at Morgan Stanley on Monday, from Overweight to Equal Weight.\n\nWhile the bank still supports the overall narrative, it believes investor expectations for AMD's AI business are too high. Morgan Stanley analysts think that the current AI expectations don't leave room for much upside, despite a recovery in the core business.\n\n\u201cWe see limited upward revision potential for AI from here,\" analysts wrote.\n\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley notes that AMD appears expensive compared to other large-cap AI plays, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), where the bank has more confidence in upward revisions to AI forecasts.\n\nDespite the downgrade, Morgan Stanley analysts continue to view AMD's product lineup as a strong competitor in the client and server CPU markets this year.\n\nMelius downgrades Adobe as enterprise software faces AI challenges\n\nEarlier in the week, Melius analysts lowered their rating on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock from Buy to Hold, with a price target of $510.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe investment firm notes that the enterprise application software sector is facing challenges with AI, drawing parallels to how on-prem hardware companies were affected by the shift to the cloud in the 2010s. They suggest this trend could persist longer than anticipated.\n\nMelius highlights that AI, enabled by companies like Nvidia and major cloud platforms, will accelerate software creation, customization, and deployment. Moreover, coding tools are allowing smaller AI-first competitors to emerge more easily.\n\nThey also point out that most SaaS companies have been increasing prices for years, making it harder to charge extra for AI, and AI-driven productivity may disrupt the traditional \"seat model\" business approach, indicating a potential transition in business models.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we see AI as a disruptor to traditional databases as unstructured data rises in both importance and usability,\u201d Melius analysts said. \u201cIn short, you could see AI's impact on Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and even parts of hold-rated Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as ongoing impacts on Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) for a while.\"\n\nBroadcom is \u201cone of the strongest AI plays,\u201d Morgan Stanley says\n\nAhead of its better-than-expected earnings report released Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating on Broadcom, describing the semiconductor company as \"one of the strongest AI plays.\"\n\nThe Wall Street giant pointed out several key catalysts for their positive outlook, including Broadcom\u2019s growth prospects in AI, potential synergies from the VMware (NYSE:VMW) acquisition, and recovery in its core enterprise semiconductor businesses.\n\nThe bank\u2019s analysts project Broadcom's AI revenues to rise from $4.2 billion in FY2023 to $14 billion in FY2025, which would account for approximately 39% of the company's projected semiconductor revenues.\n\n\"We expect Broadcom to easily meet, if not slightly exceed, AI targets,\" the analysts noted. They believe Broadcom is poised to benefit from the deployment of Ethernet in AI data centers, the continued ramp-up of Google\u2019s TPU, and the addition of two new ASIC clients.\n\nMS: Tesla could make an AI-powered phone\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may soon venture into the smartphone market, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.\n\n\u201cThe car is an extension of the phone. The phone is an extension of the car,\u201d the Wall Street firm noted, based on its discussions with automotive executives and industry experts. \u201cThe lines between car and phone are truly blurring,\u201d they added.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts have long considered Tesla's potential to expand into edge computing domains beyond vehicles. In October, they emphasized the concept of a mobile AI assistant as a significant innovation.\n\nThis idea resurfaced when Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that developing such a device is \"not out of the question\" following Apple\u2019s WWDC.\n\n\u201cAs Mr. Musk continues to invest further into his own LLM/genAI efforts, such as \u2018Grok\u2019, the potential strategic and user experience overlap becomes more obvious,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nSupercomputing at both the data center and edge levels is increasingly relevant from an automotive perspective. The latest Tesla vehicles, capable of over-the-air firmware updates, contain batteries with the energy equivalent of approximately 2,000 iPhones and come equipped with liquid-cooled inference supercomputers.\n\nMorgan Stanley asked, \u201cWhat if your phone could tap into your vehicle\u2019s compute power and battery supply to run AI applications?\u201d They pointed out that edge computing and AI have highlighted challenges like battery life, thermal management, and latency in integrating powerful AI-driven applications with today's smartphones.\n\n\u201cAny Tesla owner will tell you how they use their smartphone as their primary key to unlock their car as well as running other remote applications while they interact with their vehicles,\u201d the analysts added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock lifted to Buy as AMD, Adobe get downgraded\n\nFrench election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget rout\n\nThe Dutchman who gets Nike and Lego into wartime Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What's next for Tesla's stock as shareholders and Wall Street pros weigh in",
        "content": "Though Tesla (TSLA) shareholders voted to reinstate Elon Musk's pay package on Thursday afternoon, some investors and analysts told Yahoo Finance they remain skeptical.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is a game of chicken and the shareholders blinked,\u201d early Tesla investor Ibrahim AlHusseini said. \u201cFear of loss is a big motivator and Elon wielded that psychological mechanism to his benefit.\u201d\n\nThe venture capitalist said he unenthusiastically voted in favor of the $56 billion package.\n\n\u201cThe deal was set in 2018 when the milestones seemed virtually impossible and he met them,\" said AlHusseini, who first invested in Tesla in a Series C funding round. \"He made a deal, he delivered, and this is his reward.\u201d\n\nTesla's stock has been down nearly 30% year to date, and dropped roughly 2.5% on Friday. Now that the vote is over, AlHusseini said the stock should remain steady until its next quarterly earnings, where he forecasts that \u201cshares will drop due to another miss on deliveries and margin.\u201d\n\nTesla said 77% voted to support Musk\u2019s pay package. According to the filing, investors who held 1.76 billion shares voted to approve the deal, while 528.9 million shares voted against it. 20.6 million shares did not vote.\n\n\u201cI just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys,\u201d Musk said onstage at the shareholder meeting. The package, comprised of options, was originally valued at up to $56 billion but is now worth roughly $46 billion due to a fall in Tesla's market capitalization.\n\nIn January, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that the original pay package, which was approved by 73% of voted shares in 2018, was not negotiated fairly.\n\nThe vote to reinstate the package doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Musk will get the historic pay. A favorable vote doesn't resolve the legal challenge, and likely won\u2019t change the judge\u2019s mind. Legal experts say the final decision will be tied up with the Supreme Court and Delaware Chancery Court. Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets in a Tesla car as he leaves a hotel in Beijing, China May 31, 2023. (REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was among the shareholders urging for a vote against the package, calls the approval \u201ca mistake.\u201d Lander overseas several pension funds that own about 3.4 million Tesla shares.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how Musk moves forward, if this leads to him focusing on Tesla and developing clear plans for growth,\u201d Lander told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut if it becomes one more battle, distraction, Twitter feud, and more ego \u2014 that won\u2019t be a good thing.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s largest outside institutional shareholder, Vanguard, was pivotal in the deal's passage. Vanguard, which holds 7% of Tesla stock, initially voted no in 2018, citing concerns over the size in relation to the company\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nLongtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber has questioned Vanguard's move. \"Index funds are supposed to represent the public and often have corporate governance expectations for the companies. It seems a little bit weird that they voted for the pay package and said it aligns with shareholder incentives \u2014 which it does, but at an outrageous value,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGerber, who co-founded investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, voted yes in 2018 but advocated for a no this time. He started investing in Tesla in 2014, and his firm holds 332,000 shares as of March 31.\n\n\u201cThe package is outrageous and his performance has been horrendous for the last three years,\u201d said Gerber. \u201cBut I believe in elections, so if that's what shareholders want, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nInvestors also passed a proposal to reincorporate Tesla from Delaware to Texas, which Musk pushed for after the judge voided his pay deal.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the distraction problem,\u201d Lander said. \u201cDelaware has a set of relatively conservative laws that are the foundation of shareholder capitalism. To then pack up your marbles and move to Texas because you\u2019re pissy about a judge who said you have to follow the rules, the question is how are you going to reset?\u201d\n\nLander says he sees a strong foundation for Tesla to build on despite some worrying signs, adding that they have no immediate plans to change their investment strategy.\n\n\u201cElon deserves a great share of the credit,\u201d Lander said. \u201cNot a $56 billion share, but a very great share.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say shareholders' decision to restore Musk\u2019s compensation package is a win for investors.\n\nCanaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas, who has a Buy rating on the stock, told Yahoo Finance he is \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by the vote of confidence in Musk\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is critical to the success of Tesla in the past and in the future,\u201d Gianarikas explained.\n\nGianarikas said Tesla\u2019s prospects of developing full self-driving set the automaker apart from competitors, putting the company in an \u201cincredibly enviable position.\u201d\n\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, described the approval as a \u201cpop-the-champagne moment\u201d for Musk and shareholders. He said the pay package approval removes a $20 to $25 overhang on shares.\n\n\u201cThis is just the start of the next chapter, as Musk calls it, in the Tesla growth story. It's one of the best disruptive names in the world,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt's one of the best AI plays in the market.\u201d\n\nIves, who cautions a no vote could have resulted in Musk leaving Tesla, sees Tesla\u2019s valuation surpassing $1 trillion in 2025 as Musk dedicates more time and focus to the automaker.\n\n\"You're seeing old-school Musk return now ... Tesla needs Musk and Musk needs Tesla,\u201d Ives added.\n\nBut Dave Harden, chief investment officer of Summit Global, cautioned against buying Tesla shares at this time.\n\n\"It's significant dilution possibilities for shareholders, and it causes one to want to do things that are risky,\" said Harden.\n\nThe company has not proven itself in AI and robotics, and its major growth burst in EVs has already happened, Harden argues.\n\n\"I think that there's going to be much more chatter and much more opportunity to get in when you can see clearly that the growth is going to happen,\" said Harden.\n\n\"I would recommend to hold on Tesla and wait. If you're in the shares, I'd probably sell,\" he added.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Cathie Wood\u2019s stunning new $2,600 Telsa prophecy and Wall Street\u2019s Nvidia stock prediction share an often overlooked investing truth",
        "content": "On June 13, I posted a story asserting that the giant run-up in its market cap to $3.1 trillion made it virtually impossible for Nvidia to grow its sales and profits at the lightning pace needed to reward shareholders.\n\nThe same day, Cathie Wood, chief of Ark Invest, appeared on CNBC to champion her firm's new, breathtakingly bold, projections for Tesla's stock price. Wood posited that the EV leader's shares would hit $2,600 by 2029, almost fifteen-fold its current level of $175. In a report issued the previous day, three Ark analysts provided the financial metrics it expects Tesla to reach five years hence that justify that never-before-witnessed moonshot in value. Their work mightily impressed Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who tweeted, \"I think it's worth looking at Ark's analysis, I think that's the most accurate analysis.\"\n\nStacking Nvidia's challenges versus Wood's stunning new Tesla prophesy\n\nComparing the heroics Nvidia must achieve to prove a good investment, and the feats Wood expects from Tesla, makes her forecast look like the bigger fantasy\n\nIn the Nvidia piece, I stated that to deliver its shareholders a relatively modest 10% annual return over the next seven years, Nvidia would most likely need to double its market cap to $6.2 trillion by 2031. I'll spare you the details, but I estimated that getting there would require, by the end of that timeframe, $200 billion in annual net earnings and $580 billion in revenues, for respective annual increases of 25% and 50%. Conclusion: The chances of dwarfing the numbers now posted by the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are remote, to put it mildly. Put simply, investors have hiked the bar for what the AI-pioneer must achieve so high that it's most likely to prove a great company and a poor investment.\n\nThe Ark report predicts that Tesla will achieve an \"enterprise value\" of $8.2 trillion in five years. Although enterprise value includes debt as well as equity, Ark appears to attribute almost all of that number to the latter. Hence, it's saying that Tesla's market cap will jump one-third higher than the required but fantastical $6.2 billion bogey for Nvidia in my \"roadmap for success,\" and do it far faster, in five years instead of seven! Tesla starts the contest sandbagged by a heavy handicap: It's earned just $13.7 billion the last four quarters, one third the $42.6 billion booked by Nvidia.\n\nThe Ark analysis puts Tesla profits by 2031 in the $300 billion range. Getting there would require annual gains of 90% through 2029. That's almost four times the hurdle for Nvidia. Ark foresees $1.2 trillion in revenues for Tesla at the end of the five year window; ringing the bell would take annual increases of 65%, a growth rate far faster than the 50% needed to make Nvidia a decent buy at these prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased purely on the scale of the numbers measured against what other tech greats have garnered and the size of Tesla's industry, the Ark estimates look far more outrageous than the over-the-top numbers baked into Nvidia's valuation. That $300 billion in 2029 profits would be three times what Apple earns today, and the $1.2 trillion in revenues would tower at five-times Microsoft's. Tesla's 2029 sales would equal the combined total for the world's five largest automakers, Volkswagen, Toyota, GM, Ford and BMW. At an $8.2 trillion market cap, Tesla would be worth four-fold the all-in valuation of the global auto industry.\n\nThe goals investors have set for Nvidia, and Wood's stupendous outlook for Tesla, turn on the vision that a single player will dominate a revolutionary industry, facing little competition, virtually in perpetuity. For AI colossus Nvidia, that domain's already exploding, what's in doubt is the prospect of dominance forever. For Tesla, the business\u2014robo taxis running on its super-lucrative software\u2014doesn't exist yet, and whether and when it arrives, how profitable it will be, and whether King Elon can rule it alone, are all big questions.\n\nYou've got to marvel at Wood for making a call that looks ridiculous based on anything we've ever witnessed in the financial markets, and Musk for praising the \"analysis\" behind the gravity-defying target. They might be true believers\u2014but investors should do the math.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Electric Avenue: 3 EV Stocks That Will Electrify Your Investment Returns",
        "content": "Electric vehicle sales are accelerating again, creating an opportunity for some of the top EV stocks to buy.\n\nIn California, for example, about\u00a024% of all new cars sold were electric in the first quarter, according to the California Energy Commission. The state recently approved about $1.9 billion to build 40,000 new public EV chargers to help fuel adoption.\n\nAs for the rest of the country, \u201cSix of the 10 biggest EV makers in the US saw sales grow at a scorching pace compared to a year ago,\u201d\u00a0says Bloomberg.\u00a0Even better,\u00a0\u201cFor the rest of 2024, GM appears to be on the brink of becoming the biggest driver of EV growth in the US.\u00a0The Detroit automaker has committed to electrifying some of its biggest brands,\u00a0which arefinally reaching production after years of delays.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u00a0also\u00a0expects US deliveries to top\u00a02.5 million by 2025 from about 1.1 million in 2024. In short, demand is on the run.\n\nWith that,\u00a0here are some of the top EV stocks to buy that should accelerate with better sales.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last\u00a0time\u00a0I mentioned\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0time to buy the fear. Granted, sales have slipped but it\u2019s still dominating the market.\u201d\n\nThat was on May 20, as Tesla traded at about $175. Today, it\u2019s up to $191.08, which is still an attractive buy, especially with EV sales regaining momentum. From that last traded price, I\u2019d like to see Tesla initially retest $205.\n\nHelping,\u00a0Wedbush analysts say the $56 billion Elon Musk compensation removes a $20 to $25 overhang on the TSLA stock. That\u2019s because the award now dispels fears Musk will focus on other projects outside of Tesla, including a generative artificial intelligence project. With this, Wedbush has a $275 price target on TSLA shares.\n\nPlus, Tesla\u2019s market dominance is only expected to become stronger.\n\nAs noted by QZ.com, \u201cWhile Tesla was out selling 50,000 new EVs, Ford was struggling to hit 10,000 EVs sold in second place. Behind it was\u00a0Hyundai, which shifted 5,686\u00a0electric cars in March and BMW sold 4,246 electric models.\u201d\n\nBYD Co. (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nThe last time I mentioned\u00a0BYD Co.

        "content": "Over the past several years, EVs have taken front-stage in the news. While large-scale adoption of electrification has yet to materialize, the rapid improvement of technology and manufacturing, especially in low-cost areas like China, has been a leading driver behind the growing pace of EV acceptance.\n\nAlready, compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, upfront costs for EVs have slowly narrowed to the point that many drivers are considering switching to electric cars to benefit the environment and their pockets in the long run. Despite many worries over waning EV demand, EV sales in the U.S. are still forecasted to rise by 20% in 2024. Additionally, by 2030, the IEA expects nearly 20% of all roads in the U.S. and Europe to be electric!\r\n\r\nOf course, while many automotive companies around the world have slowly begun offering at least one EV in their lineup, not all EV companies are created equal. As such, this article will spotlight our chosen three EV extraordinaires to invest in if you are looking to take a stake in the future of transportation.\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford Go Electric Automobile Exhibition At Genoa, Italy. F stock\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) is one of the oldest companies in the automotive industry and is famous for producing the world\u2019s first mass-produced car, the Model T in 1908. While the stock is just trading at about $12, Wall Street analysts have projected a one-year price high for this stock of up to $21!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCurrently, one of the biggest gaps in the global EV market is the lack of affordable options. Compared to the average cost of an ICE car at $35,722, EV prices remain nearly 50% more expensive at $53,048. While many proponents of EVs still argue for the long-term cost savings of EV, for many average consumers, these upfront costs are simply too much. Thankfully, over the past two years, Ford has been leveraging their sheer scale of manufacturing to serve the masses. While this \u201cmodern-day EV model T\u201d still isn\u2019t fully developed, investors can bet on this potential development now as a key growth catalyst into the next several years.\n\nFord has always been a strong investment over the past years. With a strong dividend rate of 4.97% and solid 12% compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for shareholder returns over the last five years, Ford is seen by many as a stable leader in the automotive space. Now, with Ford\u2019s valuation dipping to over 50% under its sector median, investors should highly consider this company as a discounted opportunity in a key leader in the changing automotive market.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe undisputed king of EVs, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long dominated the EV market with its first-mover advantage. So much so that it has often become the industry comparable when it comes to features, innovation and prices. Currently, the stock trades at about $177 per share, but Yahoo Finance analysts project a potential one-year upside of up to 70%.\n\nTesla has built quite a strong lineup of cars, with its cheapest being the Model 3, ranging between an average of about $40,000 to $55,000. A key differentiator for this company in the U.S. market has been its ability to consistently create some of the cheapest and bestselling vehicles. However, as Chinese EV companies begin to threaten Tesla in price, Tesla is making plans to release even more cost-optimized EVs to increase their addressable market and capture a broader range of customers.\n\nWhile investors have often avoided Tesla stock for its inflated price, Tesla\u2019s valuation is now sitting over 50% below its five-year historic price-to-earnings (P/E) average. Despite this strong pullback in its stock price, the company has stabilized its margins to a much more comfortable 17% and has made labor cut moves to further boost profitability. For those who missed Tesla during its first ramp-up, now is the time to scoop up a few shares into this world-class EV extraordinaire before its rebound.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Tesla dominates the EV market in terms of sales figures and publicity, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands as an underdog with high value amidst the industry slowdown. While this company is trading just above $11, Yahoo Finance analysts optimistically hold a one-year price target between an average of $16 to $36!\n\nFrom the start, the company has focused on ergonomics, quality, sustainability and more importantly, a vehicle platform dubbed \u201cskateboard\u201d architecture. This innovative platform has been a strong competitive moat allowing Rivian to cut costs and attain economies of scale by reducing the need to engineer a new base for each car. Additionally, Rivian has also released a new addition to their EV lineup, the R1S SUV. While these more pricey vehicles aren\u2019t for all consumers, their focus on performance and advanced technology and design has built a strong loyal customer base.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Rivian reported an excellent 82% YOY revenue growth. While this company is still in a highly cash-burning phase, the company\u2019s balance sheet and liquidity runway should give investors faith in this hyper-growth company. With a price/book ratio of 1.45x compared to the sector median of 2.16x, you would be foolish not to put this future-looking EV contender on your watchlist!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How Elon Musk's $44.9B Tesla pay package compares with the most generous plans for other U.S. CEOs",
        "content": "Even though the median U.S. CEO pay package last year was nearly 200 times more than a worker in the middle of their company pay scales, Elon Musk's record-setting Tesla compensation dwarfs them by comparison.\n\nTesla shareholders on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of restoring Musk's 10-year pay plan, valued by the company in April at $44.9 billion. It was worth more early in the year, but Tesla's stock value has fallen about 25% since then.\n\nThe all-stock package, approved by the board and shareholders in 2018, rewards Musk for hitting milestones that include raising Tesla's market value, pretax income and revenue.\n\nIt had been tossed out by a Delaware judge in January who said the process for approving it was \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d The court ruled that Musk controlled the company's board, and shareholders weren't fully informed.\n\nBut the company said Musk deserves the pay because he turned Tesla into the top-selling electric vehicle maker in the world, increasing its market value by billions.\n\nEven with the reapproval vote, Musk won't get access to the stock options just yet. Tesla is expected to ask the judge to revisit her decision in light of the vote, and if she doesn't, the company probably will appeal the ruling to Delaware's Supreme Court. The whole process could take months.\n\nNo matter the outcome, Musk's package \u2014 the largest award to a CEO of a U.S. public company \u2014 is far above what's been granted to other chief executives. Here's how the package compares:\n\nWITH THE MEDIAN CEO PAY\n\nThe median pay package for an S&P 500 U.S. CEO last year was $16.3 million, according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar. If you multiply that by 10 to get $163 million for a decade of work, Musk's earnings still would be 275 times greater.\n\nIn her January ruling that struck down the package, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick wrote that Musk's package, then worth about $56 billion, was 250 times larger than the median peer CEO's pay plan.\n\nWITH INDIVIDUAL CEOS\n\nThe top earner in the AP's survey was Hock Tan, CEO of artificial intelligence company Broadcom Inc. His package, mostly consisting of stock awards, was valued at about $162 million, when given to Tan at the start of fiscal 2023. Thanks to a surging stock price, Broadcom in March valued Tan\u2019s pay package, plus older options he hadn\u2019t yet cashed in, at $767.7 million. That's an amount easily eclipsed by Musk\u2019s potential haul of 304 million shares worth almost $45 billion.\n\nOther CEOs at the top of AP's survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnically, Musk got no compensation last year because he didn't get any stock options. But he stands to get even richer if his pay package goes through.\n\nWITH TESLA WORKERS\n\nIt's difficult to calculate what Musk's annual pay would have been last year. The company says he got nothing. But if his compensation package makes it through the courts, his pay will be in the billions. According to the company's proxy filing this year, the median annual pay of a non-CEO Tesla employee last year was $45,811.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. investors finally have a roadmap for how it will use artificial intelligence \u2014 and they\u2019ve responded by pushing the stock to a record high this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSouthwest Plane Plunged Within 400 Feet of Ocean Near Hawaii Wells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Bump Stock Ban Tossed Out by Supreme Court in Gun-Rights Win Yes, Everyone Really Is Sick a Lot More Often After Covid Tesla Investors Get Behind Musk\u2019s Fight for $56 Billion Pay Deal\n\nWall Street is betting that new iPhone AI features \u2014 including Apple\u2019s agreement with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT \u2014 will spur a massive upgrade cycle among users who have been holding on to older devices.\n\nInvestors have \u201cmore confidence that Apple is back in the game, that it has caught up competitively, and that it will see a re-acceleration of growth, given the installed base of phones that will need to upgrade to take advantage of this new tech,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. \u201cApple will be a major beneficiary of AI, and the stock is catching up.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s shares fell on Friday but still managed to close the week with a nearly 8% advance, the stock\u2019s best since May. The rally added about $239 billion in market value and pushed Apple back into record territory for the first time since December.\n\nWall Street\u2019s top stocks have quickly re-shuffled on AI optimism. Apple on Thursday overtook Microsoft Corp. as the biggest company by market capitalization. Apple was third-largest as recently as Monday, trailing behind $3.2 trillion Nvidia Corp, and Microsoft, which held pole position since January.\n\nWhile seen as short on surprises, Apple\u2019s event eased concerns that have weighed on the stock this year. Wall Street had fretted that the firm lacked an AI strategy, especially since its growth has been wanting compared with other megacaps, and its valuation is elevated. That has kept a lid on share-price gains; among the Magnificent Seven, only Tesla Inc. \u2014 down 28% \u2014 has seen a weaker performance.\n\nRevenue fell 4.3% in Apple\u2019s fiscal second quarter, the fifth contraction in the past six quarters. Despite that, it trades at about 30 times estimated earnings, above its long-term average and the roughly 27 times multiple of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nThe iPhone is by far Apple\u2019s biggest business, accounting for more than half its fiscal 2023 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, iPhone revenue fell 2% last year, a reflection of how millions are holding onto their phones for longer. AI, bulls argue, represents the kind of must-have features that will prompt them to trade up.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cPeople who weren\u2019t excited about the initial announcement are fast becoming believers that AI is the innovation that will spur the next cycle of iPhone sales,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. \u201cWe have to be realistic, and it will take time to see confirmation in the numbers, but AI has the potential to create the kind of growth that will make the stock look cheap.\u201d\n\nThe pool of users who might be in the market for an upgrade is potentially massive. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, over 40% of Apple\u2019s 800 million-plus smartphone devices are iPhone 12 or older, with another 27% of users on an iPhone 13. Fewer than 10% of current users have phones that can be upgraded to the AI software.\n\n\u201cOlder stuff will be obsolete if you want AI,\u201d wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes. Given the allure of AI, \u201cwe now have more conviction in our Super Cycle thesis that could even result in iPhone revenue growth of about 20% for up to 2 years.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of an iPhone refresh cycle has also lifted Apple suppliers. Skyworks Solutions Inc. is up 15% this week, its biggest one-week percentage gain in four years, while Cirrus Logic Inc. hit a record Thursday. Qorvo Inc. is seeing its best week since 2020.\n\nThe integration of features such as enhanced search, enhanced photo editing and text generation \u201cwill drive much broader adoption of AI than we have seen to date,\u201d wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria, who raised his rating to buy. \u201cApple is uniquely positioned to offer these capabilities, and may be the only one capable of doing so any time soon.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe massive size of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are a key reason why tech has become so dominant in equity indexes. The S&P 500\u2019s tech sector represents a staggering 32.6% of the overall benchmark index. That\u2019s the highest ratio since 2000, around the dot-com era, and up from a recent low of less than 29% from April. The trio of $3 trillion stocks together account for about 21% of the S&P 500.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nTesla Inc. investors voted for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s compensation package and moving the company\u2019s state of incorporation to Texas, signaling confidence in his leadership despite slumping sales and a precipitous drop in the stock price. Adobe Inc. shares are set for their biggest gain in about four years after projecting strong future sales for its creative products, suggesting customers are adopting the company\u2019s new artificial intelligence-based tools. The French government has offered to buy some of Atos SE\u2019s operations in its big data and security unit for an enterprise value of \u20ac700 million ($751 million) as part of discussions to restructure the embattled IT company. Crypto billionaires and their allies have amassed a $160 million war chest to protect their fortunes by bolstering US candidates who favor light-touch regulation of the embattled industry. Snowflake Inc. plans to close its own investigation this week into a hacking campaign that ensnared as many as 165 of its customers.\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika.\n\n(Updates stock moves at market close.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War How to Cool Down Parks in Hot Cities The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After overtaking their U.S. competitors in sales for the first time, Chinese carmakers are one step closer to fulfilling Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s prophecy that one day they would \u201cdemolish\u201d most other car companies.\n\nChinese carmakers sold 13.43 million cars last year, outpacing the 11.93 million cars sold by American companies, according to a report by automotive data company JATO Dynamics. Warren Buffett-backed EV maker BYD produced the most popular Chinese car, a compact sedan called the Qin, and had two other vehicles in the top 25 most sold cars last year. Tesla, for its part, claimed the title of the best selling car in 2023 with the Model Y.\n\nIn a Tesla earnings call in January, Musk praised Chinese automakers, calling them the \u201cmost competitive\u201d carmakers in the world. He also warned against Chinese automakers\u2019 rapid growth.\n\n\u201cIf there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\u201d Musk said at the time.\n\nThat prediction may slowly be coming true as \u200b\u200bChinese car brands look abroad to spur growth after seeing demand fall in China. Last year, Chinese automakers trailed only Japanese and European automakers in terms of global light vehicle sales, according to the report.\n\nFelipe Mu\u00f1oz, a senior analyst at JATO Dynamics, said the conformity of legacy carmakers is partly to blame for the rise of strong Chinese competitors.\n\n\u201cNegligence from legacy automakers, which has resulted in consistently high car prices, has inadvertently driven consumers towards more affordable Chinese alternatives,\u201d Munoz said in a statement. \u201cAs car prices continue to rise elsewhere, Chinese car brands are capitalizing on this trend to gain market traction at a much faster pace.\"\n\nConfronted with the might of China\u2019s growing auto sector, some legacy carmakers are taking action to compete. In Japan, two of its biggest automakers, Nissan and Honda, announced a partnership in March to compete with China on electric vehicles.\n\nSome politicians have accused Chinese carmakers of unethical behavior while attempting to stymie their threat through tariffs. This week, the European Commission slapped three Chinese automakers, including BYD, with import tariffs ranging from 17.4% to 38.1% following a probe by the commission that found battery electric vehicles from China benefited from state subsidies unfair to global competition.\n\nIn May, President Joe Biden also increased the tariff on imported Chinese electric vehicles to 102.5% up from the previous rate of 27.5%.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I\u2019m not going to let that happen on my watch,\u201d Biden said in a previous statement this year.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Shareholders Back Musk's Pay: Hold Tesla (TSLA) for Long-Term",
        "content": "In a show of enduring faith for Tesla\u2019s TSLA visionary CEO, shareholders voted in favor of Elon Musk\u2019s hefty pay package of roughly $48 billion (composed of stock options) during the company\u2019s annual general meeting yesterday. This decision underscores the confidence investors have in Musk\u2019s leadership and vision despite recent challenges and legal hurdles.\n\nMusk\u2019s Pay Package Controversy\n\nThe saga of Musk\u2019s pay package began in 2018 when it was first approved at a staggering $56 billion. However, earlier this year, a Delaware court invalidated it, citing that Tesla's board did not act in the best interest of shareholders when approving such an extravagant package. This led to a fresh shareholder vote, which ultimately reaffirmed support for Musk, albeit at a reduced value due to the decline in Tesla\u2019s stock price.\n\nHaving said that, Musk needs court approval to receive the compensation, and the legal dispute over the compensation plan is far from over. Legal experts predict that the resolution of the lawsuit could take months. But the vote has boosted Tesla's position in ongoing litigation. If approved by the court, this pay package would become the largest executive pay package in U.S. history.\n\nTSLA\u2019s Current Challenges & Prospects\n\nOf late, shrinking automotive margins and a slowdown in deliveries amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market have been plaguing Tesla. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023.\u00a0These headwinds have contributed to the downward pressure on TSLA stock of late. Shares of the company have declined 27% year to date.\n\nNevertheless, Tesla remains a technological pioneer and a dominant player in the EV market. The long-term investment thesis hinges on its ability to navigate the current downturn and capitalize on new technological frontiers.\n\n5 Reasons to Believe in TSLA\u2019s Long-Term Prospects\n\n1. Electrifying \u201cNon-Automotive\u201d Growth: Tesla\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is on a robust growth trajectory on the back of the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment stands out as Tesla's most lucrative, with the highest margins. Over the past three years, energy storage deployments have witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 120.7%. In 2023 alone, deployments increased 125% year over year, primarily due to the expansion efforts at the Mega factory in Lathrop, California.\n\nTesla anticipates that energy storage deployments will increase at least 75% in 2024 amid ongoing efforts to ramp up production at the Megapack factory to meet escalating demand. This growth underscores the potential of TSLA\u2019s non-automotive ventures to become significant revenue streams, complementing its core automotive business.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. NACS to Bolster Charging Business:\u00a0Tesla's charging division is poised to substantially enhance its overall profitability. Currently, the company's expansive global supercharging network boasts more than 50,000 connectors. Noteworthy automotive giants like Ford, General Motors, Mercedes and others have already enlisted to utilize Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS).\n\nThis growing adoption of NACS by other automakers positions Tesla\u2019s charging business as a substantial revenue stream. As the EV market expands, the demand for reliable and accessible charging infrastructure will likely increase, further boosting the company\u2019s profitability.\n\n3. Strong Balance Sheet: Tesla\u2019s strong balance sheet provides it with the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities. The company\u2019s long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 4.4% compares favorably with the industry average of 40%. Additionally, Tesla\u2019s times interest earned ratio of 44 significantly surpasses the industry average of 8.\n\nHigh liquidity and low leverage allow Tesla to invest in innovation and expansion without compromising financial stability. This financial strength is a critical factor in supporting its ambitious growth plans.\n\n4. Affordable EV Models on the Horizon: The company\u2019s plans to produce new affordable EV models sooner than expected bodes well. Tesla is speeding up its schedule to launch new models, targeting production to start late this year or early 2025 instead of the second half of 2025. The new vehicles, including more affordable options, will combine elements from both next-generation and current platforms, enabling streamlined production on existing manufacturing lines.\n\nThe introduction of more affordable EV options is expected to drive sales growth and expand Tesla\u2019s market share. As EV adoption increases globally, Tesla\u2019s ability to offer cost-effective solutions will be a key competitive advantage.\n\n5. Promise of AI Breakthrough: Tesla\u2019s advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving technology represent significant growth opportunities. The introduction of TSLA\u2019s humanoid robot project (Optimus), the release of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software (V12) and plans to showcase its robotaxi or Cybercab in August signify promising developments.\n\nTesla\u2019s approval to roll out FSD technology in China, coupled with a partnership with a Chinese tech giant for mapping and navigation functions, positions the company as a formidable competitor in the autonomous vehicle segment. Musk\u2019s focus on AI and autonomous driving is expected to be a game changer, potentially redefining the transportation landscape.\n\nBargain Valuation for TSLA\n\nTesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market, coupled with its innovative capabilities and high growth potential, justifies a premium valuation compared to traditional automakers. That being said, Tesla\u2019s stock is currently trading well below its historical high valuations. From a price-to-sales perspective, TSLA is at an attractive level, offering investors a compelling entry point. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile its near-term outlook is clouded by market headwinds and legal battles, the long-term prospects remain promising. Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving, AI and non-automotive growth areas positions it well for future success. For investors who believe in Musk\u2019s vision and Tesla\u2019s potential to drive innovation, it presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. Despite the current downturn, Tesla\u2019s strategic initiatives and technological advancements make it a stock worth holding for the future. The long-term expected EPS growth rate for the stock is 21.6%, higher than the industry\u2019s 15.1%.\n\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Tech Innovation To Solve EV Challenges\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) got the lead on the EV front as a pioneer with Elon Musk\u2019s visionary leadership. But regulatory challenges, competition and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment made the ambitious Tesla focus on making an affordable vehicle while autonomous driving remains work in progress. Tesla aims to build its more cost-effective next-generation EV at its new factory in Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) company just revealed its solution to an EV challenge and\u00a0Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP)\u00a0just got recognized as innovator for its contribution to the automotive sector as it\u2019s about to release the Alpha launch of its eagerly anticipated solar-powered accessories for pickups.\n\nIntel To Lower Costs Of EV Making And Boost EV Performance\n\nIntel just presented a new SOC solution that promises to accelerate EV innovation. The groundbreaking OLEA U310 SoC streamlines e-motor technology, lowering EV design and manufacturing costs. With today\u2019s lunch from\u00a0Silicon Mobility, an Intel Company, the new OLEA U310 system-on-chip (SoC)\u00a0promises to enhance\u00a0the efficiency of the existing battery technology through energy savings at the vehicle level. First for the industry, this next generation technology also promises to improve overall EV performance along with streamlining design and production.\n\nBuffalo Business First Awards Worksport As Innovator Of The Year\n\nWorksport just got rewarded as innovator of the year for its\u00a0pioneering\u00a0advancement\u00a0in the automotive sector.\u00a0The Alpha launch of Worksport\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0SOLIS solar-powered truck bed cover and COR portable battery system is expected as early as this summer. SOLIS will be the first-to-market solar-integrated tonneau cover, reflecting Worksport\u2019s innovative edge. Along with the COR, Worksport is bringing a game-changing power duo to the industry, promising off-grid power on the go. Tapping into the multibillion-dollar market,\u00a0the SOLIS cover\u00a0is\u00a0expected to be compatible with Ford\u00a0Motor (NYSE: F)\u00a0F-Series,\u00a0General Motor (NYSE: GM)-owned\u00a0Chevrolet Silverado, and\u00a0Stellantis (NYSE: STLA)\u00a0Ram pickups, providing options for partnership with Tesla as well. On the other hand, the COR will be offered to all consumers, independently of pickups, as anyone will be able to use it, anywhere, to power almost anything. Therefore, Worksport\u2019s pitch goes beyond building a battery that will extend a pickups\u2019 range, easing the EV range anxiety, but it promises to craft outdoor experiences like no other.\n\nStory continues\n\n2024 - A\u00a0Year Of EV Innovation\n\n2023 was the year of the electric pickup, with Tesla\u2019s eagerly anticipated Cybertruck finally hitting the road. In May, GM and Ford showed that, thanks to electric pickups and SUV, they managed to refute the EV slowdown. This year, Worksport promises to\u00a0revolutionize the\u00a0automotive accessory\u00a0market with its integrated solar technology\u00a0for pickups and Intel is set to accelerate EV innovation.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The 3 Best Stocks to Buy Now for the Short Term: June 2024",
        "content": "A soft reading from Wednesday\u2019s consumer price index report for May sent U.S. equities on a tear. The overall inflation reading from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came in flat, marking the first time in nearly two years. The drop in prices was largely related to a sizable fall in gas prices. Moreover, the core consumer price index, which excludes volatility from food and energy prices, only ticked up 0.2% on a sequential basis, which was below most estimates from economists. From a year-over-year perspective, prices rose 3.3% while the core rose 3.4%, the lowest the figure has been since April 2021.\n\nOn the same day, U.S. Federal Reserve officials released a new dot plot with their rates forecast. It indicated only a single 0.25% rate cut versus the three we had seen in a previous forecast back in December. That is to say, the Fed is still remaining cautious, but the market is finding reason to celebrate. The S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have reached new highs: the former gaining 14.5% for the year, while the latter climbed 18.8%.\n\nA broad surge in stock prices creates a fertile ground for short-term lucrative bets. Below are three of the best stocks to buy in June for the short term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeter Thiel-cofounded data analytics giant Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) has, for the most part, had a decent trading session in 2024. As of the end of trading on Wednesday, PLTR rallied about 37.3% on a year-to-date basis. The stock appeared to be on a meteoric rally in the first quarter but has leveled off.\n\nInvestors are awaiting more news on the growth of the firm\u2019s new AI Platform (AIP). Palantir released AIP in the second quarter of 2023, and the financials for its commercial business were extremely positive as a result. In essence, AIP embeds large language models (LLMs) into existing software products, Gotham and Foundry, in order to help enterprises gain critical insights from the data those products process.\n\nUnfortunately, a weak guidance reading from Palantir\u2019s first-quarter earnings report for 2024 put shares of the data analytics firm into a sort of lull. The good reading from Wednesday\u2019s CPI report could help to revitalize the momentum Palantir\u2019s stock had at the beginning of the year. However, the long-term potential of AIP will determine how PLTR will perform in the following quarters.\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have had a terrible year. The U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) behemoth, with polemic figure Elon Musk at the helm, has experienced a cataclysmic 27% plummet in its share price since the start of this year\u2019s trading session. Even when Musk warned investors about a deceleration of the EV maker\u2019s growth in 2024, nothing could have prepared investors for Tesla\u2019s worst-performing Q1 in years. In particular, Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter, representing an 8.5% year-over-year drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll the while, Chinese EV competitors, including BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) and even mobile handset manufacturer Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACY), are giving the U.S. automaker a run for its money. In May, Tesla continued to lose ground in China, its second-largest market, due to the intensifying competition there.\n\nThere may be a silver lining for TSLA shareholders, though. Signs of moderating inflation could help shares recover. Not to mention, Tesla is still a well-known name in the stock market, and retail investors will probably clamor to buy up shares this summer, creating a viable opportunity to generate short-term returns.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop.

The iPhone maker shares have fallen as much as 15% in 2024, though it has recovered since then. Ongoing woes in China, the tech firm\u2019s second largest market that has seen competition intensify with the resurgence of Huawei, coupled with an over-saturated handset market have slowed down top-line growth. The company and its shareholders are betting that AI will somehow pull Apple out of its doldrum.\n\nThis week, besides the CPI report, Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) captured headlines. The iPhone maker unveiled a partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT and the advanced LLMs running it, and a new set of features under Apple Intelligence. This new technology suite will help users summarize text, create original images and retrieve relevant data. After the announcement, AAPL soared more than 7%, and subsequent near-term gains are possible, especially with an improving macro environment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "'Don't fire Steve Jobs': Tesla analysts react to approval of Elon Musk's pay package",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock slipped slightly on Friday after shareholders reapproved Elon Musk\u2019s record-breaking pay pact, removing a big overhang on the stock as investors blessed the controversial compensation plan.\n\nTesla shares surged the day before as Musk all but said passage of the pay plan was a fait accompli. Nonetheless, with 72% of votes cast by shareholders (excluding Musk and his brother Kimbal) in favor of the $56 billion compensation package, analysts believe clouds around Musk\u2019s future and leadership of the company have dissipated.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in Silicon Valley: \u2018Don\u2019t fire Steve Jobs.\u2019 When someone truly brilliant comes along and chooses to run a company, any sensible investor must do everything in their power to keep them,\u201d wrote DataTrek\u2019s Nick Colas in a note Friday morning.\n\nColas, who cut his teeth as an analyst covering Detroit's Big Three automakers, noted that Open AI broke the rule when its board fired Sam Altman late last year.\n\n\u201cTesla shareholders have not made the same mistake,\u201d Colas said.\n\nLongtime Tesla bull Dan Ives said it was a \u201cpop-the-champagne\u201d moment for Tesla and Musk, with the company now focused on execution.\n\n\u201cThis removes a $20-$25 overhang on the stock in our opinion that has weighed on shares since the head-scratching Delaware ruling set this Twilight Zone soap opera on earlier this year,\u201d Ives wrote in a note late Thursday night. \u201cOur bull case is now $350 heading into the next 12 to 18 months as we believe the next chapter in the Tesla growth story around autonomous and FSD [full self-driving] is now on the near-term horizon set to take Tesla's valuation to north of $1 trillion in 2025 in our view.\u201d\n\nCFRA analyst Garrett Nelson also expressed relief in a note on Thursday night. \u201cWe think the news takes a potentially disastrous scenario off the table, in which Musk could have potentially left Tesla and opted to dedicate more time to his other (non-public) companies, which could have triggered a \u2018brain drain\u2019 of top talent and had massive implications for the future of the company (and TSLA\u2019s stock price).\"\n\nMusk lays out his vision Elon Musk at Tesla's 2024 Shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas. (Screenshot: Tesla YouTube stream) (Tesla YouTube stream)\n\nMusk took the stage and gave a presentation following the passage of the amendments and revealed a slate of products and ambitious goals.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not optimistic, this factory would not exist,\u201d Musk said during the presentation, which took place at Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas. \u201cI\u2019ve been pathologically optimistic from birth. But this is the reason why every one of these is happening. But, I do deliver in the end. That\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the upcoming Tesla robotaxi, Musk said some vehicles in the fleet would be owned by Tesla, while others would be owned by customers. Tesla owners would have something akin to \u201cAirbnb\u201d functionality with their cars, Musk said, giving them control over their vehicles' timing and frequency of participation in the robotaxi network.\n\nResearch firms like Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest see robotaxis as the main driver for the company's long-term $2,600 price target.\n\n\u201cARK estimates that nearly 90% of Tesla\u2019s enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the robotaxi business in 2029,\u201d ARK analyst Tasha Keeney wrote in a note. \u201cMeanwhile, electric vehicles could approximate a quarter of total sales and ~10% of Tesla\u2019s earnings potential, as we believe the robotaxi business will have much higher margins.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal event is set for Aug. 8. Visitors view the Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla \"Optimus\" at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\nAs for Tesla\u2019s Optimus robot, Musk had more ambitious plans for the rollout. Musk said limited production of the robots was coming this year, and that Tesla itself would have \u201ca few thousand\u201d robots working in Tesla factories next year. This despite the fact Optimus has only been seen recently in a few demonstration videos released by Tesla.\n\n\u201cI think Optimus is a $25 trillion dollar market cap situation; it\u2019s an immense amount of work to get there, but we\u2019re moving very fast down that road,\u201d Musk said.\n\nThe combination of robotaxis, Optimus, and autonomy are part of Musk\u2019s AI-driven focus at Tesla \u2014 which Musk believes is the true way to view Tesla as a company.\n\n\u201cWe're not just starting a new chapter for Tesla; we're starting a new book,\u201d Musk said regarding AI and its importance to Tesla\n\n\u201cWhat's the new book about? AI/robotics: autonomous driving and Optimus,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas wrote on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI could argue [Tesla] is one of the best AI plays in the market, when you look out over the next two, three, four years,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Ives added in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Tesla's product roadmap from its 2024 shareholder meeting presentation. (Tesla) (Tesla)\n\nFurther adding to the Tesla story and future growth, Musk revealed in a slide during the presentation that three new Tesla vehicles are planned for the future. Two of them, most likely the robotaxi and cheaper Tesla vehicle, have been mentioned by Tesla as being in the pipeline, but a new van-like product also appears under a sheet.\n\nOn a slight down note for investors, Musk confirmed near-term demand and sales will still struggle somewhat as the industry goes through a transitionary period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough sledding out there,\u201d Musk said with regard to the EV market, adding that competitors have also been pulling back EV investment and production.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Tesla driver tells police he was using 'self-drive' system when his car hit a parked police vehicle",
        "content": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 A Tesla apparently operating on one of the company's automated driving systems crashed into a parked police vehicle Thursday near Los Angeles, narrowly missing an officer who was managing traffic at another crash.\n\nThe Tesla driver told police in Fullerton, California, that he engaged the vehicle's \u201cself-drive\u201d system and used his cell phone, according to a police statement.\n\nThe collision appears to be another in a long list of crashes in which Teslas using a partially automated driving system hit firetrucks or police cars parked on roads with flashing lights activated. In the Fullerton case, the officer also had put out flares, authorities said.\n\nPolice said the crash is still under investigation, but called the California driver's conduct a \u201cclear violation of responsible driving practices and California law.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has made Tesla recall its \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot\u201d systems, said Friday it is aware of the crash and has contacted Tesla for more information.\n\nAlthough the driver told authorities he switched on \u201cself-drive\u201d mode, it wasn't clear whether he meant \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d or Autopilot. Messages were left early Friday seeking clarification from police and from Tesla.\n\nNeither \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d nor Autopilot can drive themselves, and Tesla tells owners that they must be ready to intervene at all times. \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d which is being tested on public roads by volunteer Tesla owners, can take on most driving functions, even on city streets, the company says. Autopilot is supposed to keep vehicles from hitting objects in front of them, and keep them centered in their lanes.\n\nFullerton police said the officer saw the Tesla coming, and he and a police dispatcher who was riding with him were able to quickly move to the side of the road. \u201cA potential disaster was averted,\u201d police said in the statement.\n\nThe Tesla driver stayed at the scene of the crash, which happened near an intersection at 12:04 a.m. Thursday. The driver is cooperating with police.\n\nOfficers were investigating a fatal crash at the time the Tesla hit the police car, authorities said.\n\n\u201cWhile there are no laws against the \u2018self-drive\u2019 mode, all rules and laws of the road still apply to the driver while controlling the vehicle,\" the statement said.\n\nNHTSA began investigating Autopilot crashes into emergency vehicles in 2021, but closed the probe in April after Tesla agreed to recall the software and boost its driver monitoring functions. Later NHTSA began investigating whether the company's recall actually worked.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn documents explaining why the investigation was ended, NHTSA said it ultimately found 467 crashes involving Autopilot resulting in 54 injuries and 14 deaths.\n\nIn addition, the agency found 75 crashes and one death involving \u201cFull Self Driving.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether the system was at fault. NHTSA last year made Tesla recall the software after finding that the system misbehaved around intersections and could violate traffic laws.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said Thursday at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting that the safety of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d is better per mile than human drivers, but he did not give full underlying data.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) stocks have the potential to deliver strong gains for investors as the transition to electric vehicles accelerates. Despite impressive gains already experienced by many EV stocks, the growth opportunity remains massive, driven by government policies, incentives, and concerns over climate change.\n\nHowever, not all EV stocks are equal, and some may be better positioned to surge ahead of competitors or become multi-baggers. These companies are leveraging their first-mover advantages, innovative tech, and solid growth prospects to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for EVs.\n\nAs the broader indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq take off as part of a bull market, EV stocks could stand to benefit more than companies in other industries. Investors of all risk tolerances and time horizons should consider the EV stocks discussed in this article, which have been thoroughly analyzed and deemed to have the best shot at delivering substantial returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are the three best EV stocks for investors to consider.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to increase vehicle deliveries by 50% in 2024. This is part of its long-term goal of achieving 20 million vehicle sales annually by 2030. The company plans to enhance its production capacity by expanding existing factories and building new ones. Notable expansions include the Texas and Berlin Gigafactories.\r\n\r\nTSLA is focusing on advancing its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. The company plans to make its FSD software widely available by late 2024. TSLA is also emphasizing energy products, with expectations to grow its energy storage deployments by 100% in 2024\u200b.\n\nThe consensus analyst rating for TSLA is \u2018hold\u2019 The average price target is $182, with a potential upside of 3% from the current price.\n\nI think that TLSA will retain its leadership position in the U.S. thanks to Biden\u2019s tariffs on Chinese EVs, which may give it a significant competitive edge. Consumers who prefer American-made EVs could still gravitate towards TSLA.\n\nNio (NIO) Retail display of NIO store at night. NIO is a Chinese electric car brand\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) is a prominent Chinese EV manufacturer, known for its premium electric vehicles and battery-swapping technology.\n\nFor Q2 2024, NIO expects vehicle deliveries between 54,000 and 56,000 units, an increase of approximately 129.6% to 138.1% year-over-year. Revenue is projected between 16,587 RMB million ($2,297 million) and 17,135 million RMB ($2,373 million), representing an 89.1% to 95.3% increase YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, In April 2024, NIO launched the 2024 ET7 Executive Edition, targeting business professionals with 180 upgrades. The new ONVO brand, introduced in May 2024, aims to penetrate the mainstream market. NIO also emphasizes improving its power and service network, forming strategic partnerships with seven automakers in China to standardize and adopt battery-swapping technologies.\r\n\r\nAnalysts have mixed views on NIO\u2019s future. Despite recent losses, projections indicate profitability by 2026 or 2027.\n\nI believe that NIO will continue to be a strong performer in its home turf of China, as well as in neighboring countries in East Asia, which has shown considerable growth. This make it one of those EV stocks to buy.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is another Chinese EV giant, known for its wide range of electric vehicles and significant market presence.\n\nThe company plans to expand its global footprint by entering new markets, including Europe and Japan. The company aims to increase its annual production capacity to 3 million units by the end of 2024. BYD also plans to enhance its battery technology and increase the production of its blade batteries, which offer improved safety and efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, BYD projects a sales target of 4 million units for 2024. The company also expects to maintain its dominant position in the Chinese EV market while growing its international presence. BYD is also investing heavily in research and development to maintain its competitive edge in battery technology and autonomous driving systems.\r\n\r\nAnalysts have a consensus rating of \u201cmoderate buy\u201d for BYDDF. The average price target is $33, suggesting a substantial upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. investors voted for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s compensation package and moving the company\u2019s state of incorporation to Texas, signaling confidence in his leadership despite slumping sales and a precipitous drop in the stock price.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Tesla Investors Back Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Deal, Texas Move Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. Tech Powers Stocks as Adobe Surges in Late Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nThe electric-car maker announced the results at its annual meeting Thursday in Austin without disclosing the breakdown of votes. Musk had foreshadowed the outcome the night before in a post on X, saying both resolutions were \u201cpassing by wide margins.\u201d\n\nThe pay vote is only advisory and doesn\u2019t guarantee Musk will get his money. A Delaware judge nullified Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation plan in January, and Tesla is expected to appeal. If that appeal fails, moving the company\u2019s legal home to Texas would allow the board to revive the pay package in a new state with potentially more favorable courts.\n\nThe 2018 package, which passed with 73% of the vote, made Musk eligible for as much as $55.8 billion in stock options if Tesla hit certain milestones. The current value of the options was closer to $48.4 billion at the close of trading Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nMusk\u2019s pay vote was widely seen as a referendum on the CEO\u2019s leadership and frustration with Tesla\u2019s corporate governance. Musk oversees six companies and is prone to distractions and abrupt strategy shifts. Earlier this year, he ordered up Tesla\u2019s biggest layoffs ever only to rehire some of the workers weeks later.\n\nShareholders also voted to reelect James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk to Tesla\u2019s eight-member board. Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has been a member of Tesla\u2019s board since 2017. Kimbal Musk, younger brother to Elon, has been on the board since 2004.\n\nTesla shares rose 0.3% in extended trading at 5:58 p.m. in New York. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the stock had fallen about 27% this year, compared with a 14% gain in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nAt the company\u2019s Austin headquarters, Tesla shareholders cheered as Musk, wearing a black Cybertruck T-shirt, walked on stage. He leapt into the air as investors chanted his name and said, \u201cHot damn, I love you guys\u201d\n\nIn a presentation, Musk hinted that the company was working on three new models, as he has in years past. He also noted that the Supercharger network was growing and that the company was speeding the production of Semi trucks. He said Tesla\u2019s weekly output of Cybertrucks hit a record of 1,300 a week.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cA lot of people said Cybertruck was fake, never going to come out. Now we\u2019re shipping a lot of Cybertrucks,\u201d Musk said.\n\nWhen asked what Musk was going to do with his billions, he explained that the pay package was structured as options and that he\u2019d have to own Tesla stock for five years. \u201cI can\u2019t cut and run, nor would I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nVote Campaign\n\nSome investors were worried that Musk would leave the company if the award wasn\u2019t reinstated. Musk has threatened to develop products outside of Tesla if he doesn\u2019t attain at least a 25% equity stake in the carmaker. He owns about 13% of the shares now and exercising the options in his compensation deal would boost his holding to roughly 21%.\n\nThe carmaker pulled out all the stops in an effort to persuade shareholders to support both Musk\u2019s pay package and the move to Texas. The company set up a dedicated \u201cVote Tesla\u201d website and ran ads on X, Musk\u2019s social media platform. In recent days, Tesla investors, engineers and current and former executives also took to X to voice their support for Musk and his leadership.\n\nSome major investors including Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System had said they had planned to vote against the measure.\n\nWhen Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick voided the pay package in January, she pointed to board director conflicts of interest and the company\u2019s failure to properly disclose terms of the plan.\n\nThe new shareholder vote may bolster Tesla\u2019s chances with a forthcoming appeal.\n\nMcCormick will hear arguments July 8 on disputed lawyer fees in the case. Once McCormick decides on the fees, she\u2019ll issue a final ruling. Musk then has 30 days to appeal it to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nLate Thursday, Tesla issued a press release confirming that the company was now incorporated in Texas. The certificate of conversion was visible on the Texas Secretary of State website.\n\nBut Tesla couldn\u2019t just approve the same compensation plan for Musk as in 2018, because Texas courts are legally obligated to honor the Delaware court\u2019s decision, according to Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware professor and corporate governance expert.\n\nThe board would have to make substantial changes to the plan and shareholders would then have to vote on Musk\u2019s compensation once more, Elson said. Then, if an investor wanted to then challenge it, they would have to sue in Texas, which is just getting its business courts off the ground.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Beene.\n\n(Adds Texas incorporation in third-last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday, after a streak of record high closes for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite stretched into a fourth straight session. In a victory for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, the electric carmaker's shareholders approved his $56 billion pay package. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares spike in extended hours trading after the Photoshop-maker lifts its annual financial guidance.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. futures were hovering around both sides of the flatline on Friday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered yet another record closing high in the prior session despite the Federal Reserve tempering some investor hopes for interest rate cuts this year.\n\nBy 03:37 ET (07:37 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had edged down by 4 points or 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 33 points or 0.2%, and Dow futures had slipped by 101 points or 0.3%.\n\nFollowing the bell on Thursday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite stood at fresh all-time highs for the fourth consecutive session, boosted in part by a Labor Department report showing an unexpected month-on-month decline in producer prices in May.\n\nThe data helped to soothe some market jitters around the Fed's updated policy projections earlier in the week, which signaled that the central bank now expects to reduce rates just once in 2024. In March, officials at the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee had forecast three.\n\n2. Tesla shareholders approve Musk pay deal\n\nTesla shareholders have voted in favor of Chief Executive Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package and the electric vehicle giant's reincorporation in Texas from Delaware.\n\nThe decision, which was announced by the company at an event in Texas on Thursday, was fueled in part by Musk's strong support from retail investors who have praised him for spearheading Tesla's past advances despite more recent worries over its flagging sales and stock price.\n\nTheir backing helped to offset vocal opposition from several institutional investors and proxy groups who had flagged concerns over the size of the pay deal -- the largest in U.S. corporate history.\n\nTesla's move to reincorporate in Texas also comes after a judge in Delaware voided Musk's pay package earlier this year, which drew the ire of the billionaire. Despite this week's approval, an ongoing appeal of the judge's ruling is projected to continue for months.\n\n3. Adobe lifts annual guidance\n\nAdobe raised its annual earnings guidance after the Photoshop-maker reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, sending shares in California-based firm surging by over 14% in extended hours trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the three months ended May 31, Adobe reported adjusted earnings of $4.48 a share on revenue of $5.31 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had forecast $4.39 and $5.29 billion, respectively.\n\n\"\u201cOur highly differentiated approach to AI and innovative product delivery are attracting an expanding universe of customers and providing more value to existing users,\u201d said CEO Shantanu Narayen in a statement.\n\nAs a result, the company is now predicting that full-year earnings per share will be between $18.00 and $18.20, while revenue is projected in a range of $21.40 billion to $21.50 billion. It had previously forecast per-share income of $17.60 to $18 and revenue of $21.30 billion to $21.50 billion for its 2024 fiscal year.\n\n4. Roaring Kitty appears to almost double GameStop (NYSE:GME) holdings\n\nKeith Gill, the investor known online as \"Roaring Kitty\", appeared to have raised his holdings of video game retailer and meme stock darling GameStop's common stock, according to a screenshot he shared on social media site Reddit.\n\nIn the screenshot, Gill seemed to have owned just over 9 million shares in the company, up from 5 million earlier this week, and more than $6 million in cash.\n\nGill's update, which came after the close of trading on Thursday, amounted to 2.1% of GameStop's 426 million outstanding shares, according to a recent regulatory filing cited by Reuters.\n\nHe also seemed to no longer own the 120,000 strike call options he had previously disclosed in his return to Reddit on June 2 following a three-year absence from the website.\n\n5. Oil slips, but remains on pace for strong week\n\nCrude prices retreated Friday, but were on course for their best week in more than two months on increased hopes for demand growth this year.\n\nBy 03:37 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.5% lower at $78.23 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.3% to $82.48 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks were up over 3% this week -- the best week since April 5.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries stuck to a forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand for 2024, overshadowing a more bearish report by the International Energy Agency. Additionally, influential investment bank Goldman Sachs forecast solid U.S. fuel demand this summer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla shareholders back Musk pay package, Adobe's outlook - what's moving markets\n\nIndia's May wholesale prices rose 2.61% Y/Y, most in over a year\n\nIndonesia central bank intervenes to defend faltering rupiah\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A 58-year-old Canadian man stole trade secrets from Tesla and tried to sell them on YouTube, authorities say",
        "content": "A Canadian national who lives in China pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiring to sell secrets he stole from Tesla to market battery assembly technology vital to electric vehicles, authorities say. He was caught in a sting operation after undercover agents posed as Long Island businesspeople looking to buy an assembly line at a trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nKlaus Pflugbeil, 58, is now facing a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and he\u2019ll be sentenced in October. His co-defendant, Yilong Shao, is still at large. Prosecutors said Pflugbeil and Shao were employees of a Canada-based manufacturing company that made and sold battery assembly lines for clients that needed alkaline and lithium-ion batteries. The Canada manufacturing firm was purchased by a company\u2014identified in reports as Tesla\u2014which gave the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker a leg up in continuous motion battery manufacturing.\n\n\u201cDespite Pflugbeil\u2019s agreement to protect what he knew was proprietary, sensitive technology, he chose to abscond with these trade secrets to China, where he sought an unfair and illegal advantage in critical industries such as electric vehicle manufacturing,\u201d assistant attorney general Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division said in a statement. The conduct jeopardized national security, said Olsen.\n\nThe assembly lines allow manufacturers to run battery production at high speeds without pausing and can produce five to 10 times more parts per minute than competitors that don\u2019t have access to it, court documents state. Between 2004 and 2017, Tesla spent about $13 million on research and development to bring the battery technology to life.\n\nBecause it was top secret and valuable to competitors, information about the battery assembly such as drawings and diagrams were stored on one particular server under the direct control of a dedicated in-house IT team. Few employees had access to the drive with the battery assembly information, the indictment states, and Pflugbeil was one of them, authorities said. He worked for the Canadian manufacturer for 12 years from January 1997 to June 2009, including two years as the head of its office in China. Around the time Tesla bought the Canadian manufacturing firm, Shao sent Pflugbeil a proposal about setting up a business together, the court docs say.\n\nPflugbeil and Shao knew the continuous motion battery assembly information was secret and that Pflugbeil took original company documents when he left in 2009, according to the DOJ. The duo set about copying the documents and drawings from the battery manufacturer and marketing their business as an alternative source for products that rely on the battery assembly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetween 2019 and 2022, authorities say Pflugbeil sent dozens of direct messages on LinkedIn claiming to sell spare parts and precision pumps. Pflugbeil also set up a YouTube account for the business and when a commenter on a video inquired about the assembly, Pflugbeil responded that his new company provided direct sales and technical support for the pumps and assembly pieces. The duo also bought ads on Google for its business, which were shown tens of thousands of times, authorities said.\n\nThe two were caught when in 2023, undercover law enforcement agents went to a trade show in Las Vegas and posed as Long Island business owners interested in buying a battery assembly line. Pflugbeil wasn\u2019t there but Shao was and said the company was interested. Pflugbeil later sent a 66-page document to undercover agents, the indictment says, with at least half a dozen drawings that belonged to Tesla.\n\nPflugbeil flew to New York in 2024 to seal what he thought was a deal to sell an assembly line, but instead he met with undercover agents in Long Island.\n\n\u201cThis blatant theft of advanced trade secrets relating to battery components and assembly blunts America\u2019s technological edge, and the Justice Department will hold accountable those who would so try cheat our country of its economic potential and threaten our national security,\u201d said Olsen.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Elon Musk walked out on stage and did a celebratory jumping jack. His arms stretched wide over his head as he hopped in jubilation.\n\nThe galvanized Musk had just been re-granted his $46 billion pay plan that a Delaware judge had previously voided. Tesla shareholders voted to reinstate the package, which the company\u2019s board had lobbied for them to do, and signed off on moving its state of incorporation to Texas.\n\n\u201cI just want to start off by saying hot damn, I love you guys,\u201d Musk told Tesla\u2019s shareholders at the meeting in Austin and those on the live stream.\n\nHOT DAMN I LOVE YOU GUYS! \u2665\ufe0f\n\n\u4e00 Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/mIt1fZ9Qi3\n\n\u2014 DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) June 13, 2024\n\nImmediately after the preliminary vote results were announced, the crowd in attendance erupted into applause. Shareholders were then treated to a sizzle reel touting Tesla\u2019s achievements in sustainability, new product lineups, and its innovation pipeline, which includes fully self-driving cars and a line of humanoid robots called Optimus. The video opened with voiceovers of some of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics. \u201cTesla could go bust,\u201d boomed the voice of investor Per Lekander, a noted Tesla bear.\n\nIn the video Musk brushed away these criticisms, as he would just minutes later with characteristic confidence in his live presentation. In his remarks Musk outlined his vision for the future of Tesla, which hinges on its ability to deliver fully autonomous vehicles. \u201cWe're not just opening a new chapter for Tesla\u2014we're starting a new book,\u201d Musk declared.\n\nTesla has a bright financial future, according to Musk. \u201cI think just based on vehicle autonomy, we can we can 110x the value of the company,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI believe that's what will happen.\u201d\n\nAt least one investor agreed with his towering projection. ARK Invest, the fund managed by longtime backer Cathie Wood, said it believed Tesla could reach an $8 trillion market cap. Wood\u2019s firm issued a whopping $2,600 price target for Tesla in 2029. The analysis banked on self-driving cars turning its revenue model and profit margins into those of a software company. \u201cThis becomes a recurring revenue model, a slice of every mile driven on that autonomous taxi network,\u201d Wood told CNBC Thursday morning prior to the vote.\n\nIn the past, Musk has said that once Tesla completes its self-driving software the company will immediately upload it to all its vehicles currently in the market. Doing so could, virtually overnight, create a fleet of self-driving cars all potentially sharing revenues with Tesla. The plan often overlooks the role regulators would have to play in allowing the move to happen.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cReally the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet,\u201d Musk said on an earnings call in April. \u201cIt might be the biggest asset value appreciation in history when that happens, when you can do unsupervised, full self-driving.\u201d\n\nMusk excoriated many investors for failing to understand the significance of Tesla\u2019s plans. He singled out institutional investors who live in New York because \u201cthey don\u2019t drive cars.\u201d\n\nThe fleet would be monetized by emulating the business models of both Uber and Airbnb, said Musk. Like Uber, Tesla would offer a rideshare service\u2014this time with no driver. Although, crucially Uber does not own the fleet of cars it uses, as Musk proposed Tesla would. Once autonomous Teslas become a reality, Musk predicted people would turn their cars into temporary taxis, just like Airbnb lets users turn their homes into a hotel.\n\nIf you\u2019re \u201cgoing away for a week, just one tap on your Tesla app,\u201d Musk said to cheers from the audience. \u201cYour car gets added to the fleet and it just makes money for you while you're gone.\u201d\n\nMusk hailed these changes as \u201csimply a matter of time.\u201d In the past he has overpromised on several critical elements of Tesla\u2019s business, something he\u2019s done at his many other ventures. In 2016, Musk claimed that self-driving cars would be available by 2018\u2014a promise that he is still making to this day. He predicted that by 2020 there would be a million robotaxis on the road. While there are some robotaxis in a few cities, they are hardly a ubiquitous mode of transportation.\n\nThis time around, Musk seemed to couch his predictions with some caveats.\n\n\u201cNow admittedly, I'm a little optimistic sometimes,\u201d Musk said \u201cSo I don't have a complete lack of self awareness.\u201d\n\nStill on his victory lap though, he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cBut if I wasn't optimistic, this wouldn't exist, this factory wouldn't exist.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Blake Brittain\n\n(Reuters) - A Canadian resident of China pleaded guilty in New York federal court on Thursday to stealing Tesla electric-vehicle battery manufacturing trade secrets and conspiring to sell them to undercover government agents, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nKlaus Pflugbeil, 58, the operator of a China-based business that sells technology used in electric vehicles, faces up to 10 years in prison for plotting with business partner Yilong Shao to sell Tesla's secrets to FBI agents posing as Long Island businesspeople, the department said in a statement.\n\nNeither Pflugbeil's attorney nor representatives for Tesla immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment. Shao, who was also charged but remains at large, could not be reached for comment.\n\n\"With his guilty plea, Pflugbeil is now being held accountable for this unlawful conduct that jeopardized our national security,\" U.S. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said in a statement.\n\nPflugbeil, who is also a citizen of Germany, was charged in New York in March. Prosecutors said Pflugbeil and Shao built their EV battery business on trade secrets from a \"leading U.S.-based electric vehicle company.\"\n\nProsecutors did not name the company but said it acquired a Canada-based manufacturer of battery-assembly lines in 2019, which matches the description of Tesla's acquisition of Canadian company Hibar.\n\nThursday's statement said that Pflugbeil and Shao both worked for the Canadian company before Pflugbeil joined Shao's business in 2020. DOJ said that the unnamed business now has locations in China, Canada, Germany and Brazil, making the same battery-assembly equipment as their previous employer.\n\n(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Sandra Maler)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock",
        "content": "In this article, I will outline three of the reasons why I\u00a0hold a bullish position\u00a0on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock. These reasons are tailwinds in advertising spending, cloud potential, and the stock\u2019s reasonable valuation.\n\nAlphabet has performed relatively well in 2024, delivering nearly twice the return you would have received by investing in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). This performance aligns with the company\u2019s growth expectations, particularly in its key markets, such as advertising, where AI innovations in Google Search are being incorporated.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that certain segments, such as the cloud, are overlooked by the market when assessing Alphabet\u2019s future potential. This might be why the stock is traded at reasonably valued multiples compared to other major tech companies.\n\nPoised to Benefit from Tailwinds in Advertising Spending\n\nAlphabet\u00a0currently holds the title of\u00a0the most dominant advertising company globally, and the digital advertising sector is poised for significant growth in the\u00a0years ahead.\n\nAccording to projections, digital advertising spending worldwide is expected to surge from $679 billion in 2023 (with 40% specifically in search advertising) to $965 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7%. With Alphabet leading the pack in digital advertising, it stands to reap substantial benefits from this upward trajectory.\n\nDigital advertising offers distinct advantages over traditional linear advertising. It enables more precise measurement of results and facilitates targeted advertising to specific audiences, rendering it a more appealing option with significantly higher returns from both business and marketing perspectives.\n\nGoogle Search, with its commanding market share in the search engine sector, and YouTube, boasting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, are pivotal assets bolstering Alphabet\u2019s competitive edge. The incorporation of generative AI features, such as products leveraging LLMs (large language models) to match ads to relevant searches, enables users to find answers to more complex queries and increases usage and satisfaction with the results.\n\nGoogle Cloud Potential\n\nAccording to Alphabet\u2019s management, the Google Cloud segment and\u00a0YouTube are\u00a0anticipated to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by 2024.\n\nIn pursuit of this goal, the company has committed to investing in infrastructure, especially servers, nearly doubling its capital expenditures to $12 billion in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Despite the Google Cloud segment operating at a loss in recent years due to reinvesting all profits into growth, Alphabet\u2019s cloud computing business remains in a growth stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the segment reported an operating margin of 9% and generated $900 million in operating income in Q1 2024 (see below), this likely has not yet translated into free cash flow, in my opinion (Alphabet doesn\u2019t disclose the segment\u2019s free cash flow figures). Source: Alphabet\u2019s Q1-2024 Report\n\nFor comparison, Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS boasts an operating margin of around 37%. As Alphabet strives to enhance the efficiency of Google Cloud through its investments, achieving margins akin to AWS could result in the company generating billions in annual operating income from this segment.\u00a0This\u00a0would represent a significant source of profit beyond its core search business.\n\nA Fairly Priced Big Tech Stock\n\nDespite a 26% increase in its stock price year-to-date, Alphabet maintains a relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its main big tech peers.\n\nConsidering a consensus that implies roughly 30% EPS growth for Alphabet this year, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23x,\u00a0which is\u00a0the lowest among its \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d peers.\u00a0This\u00a0includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which trades at\u00a025x\u00a0and\u00a0is much more discounted\u00a0than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the member of this group that\u2019s trading at the highest multiple of 67x.\n\nWhen considering cash flows, Alphabet\u2019s price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio over the trailing 12 months stands at 20x, slightly above Amazon\u2019s 19x and Meta\u2019s 16x, based on its $2.19 trillion market cap. Despite this, I still find this valuation reasonably justified. Alphabet continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, which should drive future expansion. However, these investments negatively impact short-term cash flows, resulting in a higher P/CF multiple.\n\nRegardless, Alphabet has strong net profit margins (nearly 26%), an effective monopoly in its core search business, and a pristine balance sheet within an industry approaching a trillion dollars in value and continuing to grow. These factors would typically justify a higher valuation multiple, but that is not necessarily the case for Alphabet right now.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish about the future of Alphabet stock, with the\u00a0consensus rating\u00a0being\u00a0a Strong Buy, and 32 out of 37 analysts\u00a0recommending\u00a0buying GOOGL.\u00a0The average GOOGL stock price target is $197.67, implying upside potential of 12.2%.\n\nAmong the bulls, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth asserts that GOOGL deserves a Buy rating due to confidence in\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0ability to enhance its products with generative AI technology. This enhancement\u00a0is anticipated\u00a0to significantly boost revenues, supported by the company\u2019s ability to invest in key growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, thanks to its strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere are numerous reasons to maintain a bullish stance on Alphabet that extend beyond just three factors. Still, to reiterate, I firmly believe that the company\u2019s dominant position and its ongoing investment efforts in search will yield significant returns as the industry continues to experience robust growth.\n\nFurthermore, I find that other segments, such as cloud computing, are still undervalued by the market, and there is substantial potential for value creation as investments lead to even stronger cash flows in the future.\n\nWhen considering these factors alongside the company\u2019s attractive valuation compared to other big tech firms, I maintain a highly bullish position on Alphabet stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Thursday after strength in technology shares saw Wall Street extend a recent run of record highs as data showed some cooling in inflation.\n\nGains in Wall Street were driven largely by optimism over artificial intelligence, and came even as the Federal Reserve warned that it saw fewer chances of interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.05% to 5,435.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures steadied at 19,606.75 points by 19:17 ET (23:17 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 38,646.0 points.\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq mark fourth straight day of record highs\n\nFutures steadied after Wall Street indexes marked a fourth consecutive day of record highs, amid persistent support from technology stocks.\n\nTech remained heady, extending a rally seen earlier this week that was largely triggered by market major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announcing a major foray into AI. Apple\u2019s announcement lent more fuel to the AI rally, and also saw the stock briefly become the most valuable company on Wall Street.\n\nGains in tech saw the S&P 500 rise 0.2% to a record high of 5,433.74 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.3% to a record high of 17,665.90 points. The economically sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to underperform, falling 0.2% to 38,647.10 points.\n\nPPI inflation cools, adds to disinflation narrative\n\nProducer price index data released on Thursday showed factory prices unexpectedly fell in May, adding to optimism that a disinflationary trend was in play.\n\nThe reading came a day after mildly softer consumer price index data, and ramped up hopes that inflation was cooling.\n\nStill, Wall Street\u2019s pace of intraday gains now appeared to be slowing after a four-day run, especially after the Federal Reserve warned this week that it only saw one rate cut this year, compared to earlier expectations of three cuts. The central bank also hiked its inflation outlook for the year.\n\nTech rally continues on strong earnings, Tesla\n\nChipmaker Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) surged 12% on Thursday after clocking strong quarterly earnings on AI demand, while software maker Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) also logged strong earnings and hiked its 2024 guidance on higher demand for its AI-powered editing tools. The stock surged over 15% in aftermarket trade.\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged nearly 3% on Thursday, adding another 0.5% in aftermarket trade after shareholders voted in favor of a controversial $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, as well as the company\u2019s reincorporation in Texas.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady as Wall St extends record run amid softer inflation\n\nVisa, Mastercard $30 billion fee settlement in peril\n\nGameStop postpones shareholder meet to June 17 after technical difficulties\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy in the Wake of Nvidia\u2019s 10-for-1 Split",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently completed its much-anticipated 10-for-1 stock split. That means traders who held one share of Nvida at around $1,200 per share now own ten Nvidia shares trading at around $120 per share. Investors have started considering other stocks to buy after Nvidia\u2019s stock split. Given the reduced barrier for buying whole shares, it is typical for share prices to increase in the days and weeks following a split.\n\nA stock split also signals management confidence in the company\u2019s long-term outlook. Nvidia\u2019s shares rose modestly on the first day of trading after the split. However, several analysts adjusted their price targets upward.\r\n\r\nThe broader sentiment appears to be that confidence remains strong about the ongoing growth of artificial intelligence (AI). While some debate exists around whether this growth constitutes a bubble, most analysts do not believe it is near bursting.\n\nGiven Nvidia\u2019s leadership position, its actions will likely impact other companies within the sector. Its success has even led to discussions about replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Competitors like Intel may face challenges, but other firms could find opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Nvidia is attractive because it sells AI cards, then the semiconductor manufacturer producing the chips needed for those cards deserves attention. The less prominent TSM (NYSE:TSM) counts Nvidia as its second-largest customer. Even if rivals start designing and manufacturing their own AI servers, they will still likely require TSM for chip production.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on its own AI chips and is TSM\u2019s largest customer. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are also said to work on custom chips and are TSM customers. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) chips are also manufactured by TSM. In other words, if an AI requires a chip to function, it likely has a TSM component, making this a logical consideration as one of the AI stocks to buy after Nvidia\u2019s stock split.\r\n\r\nThe Taiwanese semiconductor foundry trades at a relatively affordable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.3x for a technology company, just over half of Nvidia\u2019s 71.6x. Analysts overwhelmingly have a positive outlook for TSC stock, with a history of exceeding estimates. Taiwan semi also offers shareholders a more generous dividend yield of 1.5% compared to Nvidia\u2019s minimal 0.035%.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Nvidia\u2019s recent stock split, looking for chip stocks in the 5G and data centers sectors is prudent. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) designs AI chips and infrastructure that major technology firms use. The company has seen solid gains, but analysts believe there is further upside potential thanks to expected growth in custom AI chips.\n\nMarvell provided strong guidance in its latest earnings report, expecting 8% revenue growth in a single quarter and an even stronger second half of the year. Despite lacking a P/E ratio following its reported losses, its forward P/E of 51.16x suggests investors are willing to pay the premium after Nvidia\u2019s stock split.\r\n\r\nWhile the company remains unprofitable, analysts are optimistic about the MRPV stock and anticipate reporting its first profits in the second quarter. The average price target is $88.92 per share, representing a 26% upside from the current price. Its 52-week high hovers marginally lowered at $85.76 per share, still offering a 22% upside.\n\n\u200bArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis cloud networking solutions provider is one of the ancillary beneficiaries of the surge in AI demand. Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) high-performance networking solutions and data center switches are integral to building out AI systems, making them an essential element of the expansion of AI.\n\nAs one of the stocks to buy after Nvidia\u2019s stock split, the company is targeting revenue from its AI solutions business to reach $750 million next year, becoming the largest component of its sales. That\u2019s up from near nothing just two years ago. The company saw its EPS grow by 44% over the last year, with its gross margin up to 63.7% from 59.5% as it leverages into the higher-margin AI segment.\r\n\r\nEven considering this growth, the company still maintains a relatively appealing P/E ratio of 41.3x, just below the average for the tech sector at 45.2x. Analysts recommend buying the stock, with most setting an average price target of $319.29 per share.\r\n\r\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Takes from 3 Tesla shareholders: Unenthusiastic yes to unequivocal no as Musk awaits vote on his pay",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shareholders are answering a $56 billion question today at their annual meeting: Should Elon Musk's record pay package be reinstated after a Delaware judge struck down a previous one?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting yes unenthusiastically; I\u2019m voting yes out of principle,\u201d early investor Ibrahim AlHusseini told Yahoo Finance. Personal feelings aside, he said Tesla should honor the 2018 package that was tossed.\n\n\u201cThat was the deal. Elon hit the milestones, so he should get his compensation.\u201d\n\nAlHusseini, founder of VC firm FullCycle, invested in the electric vehicle company in a Series C funding round in 2006. AlHusseini said he steadily sold off a majority of his position in the decade that followed.\n\n\"We rode the shares through a trillion-dollar valuation. A lot of wealth got created, and his compensation was set by the board,\u201d AlHusseini added, though he thinks most of his peers will vote no this time.\n\nBut retail investors currently own around 40% of Tesla stock, and Musk claims they support his pay. Last weekend, the billionaire posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201croughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted\u201d have voted in favor of the package, adding that \u201cpublic sentiment is unequivocally supportive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching Elon trying to whip up retail enthusiasm over Twitter, I personally find that unbecoming of a half-a-trillion-dollar company,\u201d AlHusseini said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his security detail depart the company's local office in Washington, on Jan. 27, 2023. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst//File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nThe pay package, comprised of options, was originally valued at up to $56 billion but is now worth roughly $46 billion due to a fall in Tesla's market capitalization. Musk, who currently owns 12.9% of Tesla, will have a 22.4% stake if the package is restored.\n\nTop institutional shareholders BlackRock (BLK), Vanguard, State Street (STT), Geode Capital, and Capital Research, who collectively control 17% of the vote, have not publicly announced their decision.\n\nHowever, Baron Capital, Altimeter, and Ark Invest have said they will vote in favor of it.\n\nOn the other side, Norges Bank Investment Management, Glass Lewis, Institutional Shareholder Services, California Public Employees' Retirement System, and California State Teachers' Retirement System have said that the proposed amount qualifies as overcompensation.\n\nRoss Gerber, who co-founded investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, voted yes in 2018 but is going with a no this time.\n\n\u201cI think CEOs should have a lot more incentive-based pay based on the actual performance of the company, not just the stock price,\" Gerber told Yahoo Finance. \"That\u2019s the issue. Elon has every incentive to pump the stock price, but now that the performance has faltered, he hasn\u2019t suffered from that.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nGerber started investing in Tesla in 2014 and his firm holds 332,000 shares as of March 31.\n\n\u201cFor a legitimate business operation, I believe the Tesla board of directors is the most conflicted, least independent, and most incapable board of directors in the history of business,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere is no board of directors that's done a greater disservice to a company. And this pay package is an example of that negligence.\u201d\n\nNew York City comptroller Brad Lander, whose office oversees the city's public pension funds, is voting against the plan. Earlier this month, Lander wrote an open letter urging other shareholders to also reject the pay package.\n\n\"We've been raising concerns since 2018, and it's gotten worse. Two independent board members left the board because they weren't able to meet their obligations,\" Lander told Yahoo Finance. \"You just can't let a distracted billionaire make up his own rules.\"\n\nThe city's pension fund owns 3.4 million shares of Tesla.\n\nIn a letter sent to shareholders earlier this month, Tesla chairperson Robyn Denholm implored investors to support the pay package because it will incentivize Musk to keep focusing on the automaker. Musk also has stakes in X, SpaceX, Neuralink, and the Boring Company.\n\n\u201cHe already spends more time on his side projects,\u201d AlHusseini said. \u201cCybertrucks have flopped. There\u2019s 50,000 cars sitting at Tesla unsold. The only reason the stock is still at around $170 is because retail investors are hoping for some long-term robotic AI to save the company.\u201d\n\nThe shareholder meeting will take place on Thursday afternoon. In 2018, Tesla\u2019s board won approval for Musk\u2019s pay package with a 73% vote.\n\nIn a tweet overnight, Musk said that the measure had the support it needed to pass.\n\n\"That's not how the votes are supposed to be counted and made public,\" Lander said. \"Some shareholders are still voting ahead of the meeting. It's just more evidence of the failure of corporate governance at Tesla.\"\n\nShares of Tesla have slumped more than 30% this year amid sliding margins and car sales.

        "content": "Tesla shareholders are set to decide whether to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package at the electric vehiclemaker's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.\n\nMusk's compensation package, which is believed to be the largest of any CEO of a publicly traded company in the U.S., was voided by a Delaware judge after finding that Tesla's board didn't adequately disclose its members' relationships to Musk and that the company was on pace to achieve most of the performance-based package's benchmarks.\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, Tesla put the potential reinstatement of Musk's pay package to the company's shareholders to approve or reject in advance of Thursday's meeting. Shareholders will also consider changing Tesla's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, a move Musk championed in the wake of the state court's ruling.\n\nMusk and Tesla have encouraged shareholders to vote on the measures before them by offering them a chance to win a personal tour guided by Musk of Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, though the company isn't requiring entrants to vote for or against any specific matter before shareholders in order to be eligible.\n\nWORLD'S LARGEST WEALTH FUND TO VOTE AGAINST MUSK'S $56 BILLION TESLA PAY PACKAGE\n\nTesla has touted Musk's accomplishments for the EV giant since his pay package was initially approved by shareholders in 2018, writing on its website that Musk has delivered a total shareholder return of nearly 1,100% since then and adding that if he had \"failed to achieve unprecedented growth targets for Tesla, he would receive ZERO compensation. He did not fail.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nMusk's pay package has no salary or cash bonus and offers rewards in the form of stock options that are awarded based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the 10 years following 2018. The company's market capitalization is around $555 billion as of Wednesday's market close.\n\nELON MUSK URGES TESLA SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE ON PAY WITH SPECIAL OFFER\n\nThe vote on Musk's package has drawn support and opposition from a variety of stakeholders and proxy advisory firms in the buildup to Thursday's vote.\n\nTesla board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to investors that \"If Tesla is to retain Elon's attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal.\"\n\n\"Motivating someone like Elon requires something different,\" she added. \"This is one of the key reasons the award also requires Elon to hold any shares he receives upon exercise of stock options for five years after he exercises the options \u2013 which can only serve to incentivize him to continue delivering value to Tesla and our stockholders.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTESLA SHAREHOLDERS URGED TO NIX ELON MUSK'S $56B PAY PACKAGE\n\nFlorida's pension board announced that it voted in favor of reinstating Musk's pay package and said the plan \"exhibits very high levels of pay-for-performance.\" The pension fund holds 2.89 million shares and is Tesla's 80th largest investor.\n\nProminent investor Ron Baron, founder of Baron Capital, released an open letter last week saying he backs the compensation plan. He wrote that \"Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk,\" adding that \"Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\"\n\nELON MUSK WAVES OFF HUNTER BIDEN VERDICT, SAYS MORE SERIOUS CRIME IS 'TAKING BRIBES'\n\nProxy advisory firm Glass Lewis wrote in late May that it opposed Musk's compensation package because of its \"excessive size\" as well as the impact of Musk exercising his stock options and the concentration of the company's ownership.\n\nGlass Lewis also cited Musk's \"slate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects\" that have increased after the acquisition of Twitter, now known as X, as well as the billionaire's other ventures. Another proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, also signaled its opposition to the pay plan.\n\nTESLA MUST FACE FALSE ADVERTISING CLAIMS AGAINST AUTOPILOT, CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE RULES\n\nCalifornia Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) CEO Marcie Frost said the pension would oppose Musk's pay package and wrote that the \"exorbitant compensation is at odds with CalPERS' longstanding views on executive pay\" and that it's \"excessive when compared to executives at peer companies, highly dilutive to shareholders, and isn't tied to the long-term profitability of Tesla.\"\n\n\"While we agree that Mr. Musk is entitled to be well compensated for his work, we also believe that a pay package should be commensurate to a company's performance with reasonable salary caps. Those features are absent in the deal as structured,\" Frost added.\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees the city government's public pension funds, said he opposes the compensation package in a post on X. He wrote that \"Elon Musks's (sic) are threatening to pull the company in bad directions.\"\n\nNorway's $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 holds a 0.98% stake in Tesla and announced last week that it would vote against reinstating the pay package.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Elon Musk's $56B Tesla pay package in the balance as shareholders hold meeting\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Signs that Tesla Inc. shareholders are set to approve a $56 billion pay package for Elon Musk have given the stock a boost, but the electric vehicle-maker faces broader challenges.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. Chinese Trader\u2019s $20 Million Pile of Russian Copper Goes Missing Gavin Newsom Wants to Curb a Labor Law That Cost Businesses $10 Billion US Inflation Broadly Cools in Encouraging Sign for Fed Officials\n\nMusk late on Wednesday posted early results on X, the social media site he owns, and said shareholders voted \u201cby wide margins\u201d in favor of the two key resolutions \u2014 re-approving his compensation package and moving Tesla\u2019s state of incorporation to Texas. The shares gained in early trading, with final results due later Thursday.\n\nSuch an outcome would remove a big risk that analysts and investors have been wary of: Musk\u2019s threat to take his artificial-intelligence ideas elsewhere upon a rejection of his pay plan. That would have spelled disaster for a stock whose pricey valuation depends on an AI story that falls flat without its CEO.\n\n\u201cThis removes a $20-$25 overhang on the stock,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to clients, referring to the results touted by Musk. Ives also noted that challenges remained for Tesla \u2014 choppy demand for electric cars, and the arduous task of building a truly self-driving vehicle.\n\nThe debate on whether Tesla is a car company or a technology firm is longstanding, but a slowdown in electric vehicle demand and a surge of competitors has made this distinction even more crucial. The massive profit margins that it once brought in from EV sales are largely a thing of the past.\n\nTesla\u2019s transformation into an AI company will hinge on its ability to develop self-driving cars, an ambitious project that many see as years or even decades away. For many investors, Musk\u2019s focus on this goal is what gives them confidence. Any doubts about his commitment to the company tend to weigh heavily on the valuation, which at around 70 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, is by far the priciest among the tech giants.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman had likened Thursday\u2019s vote with the one for the company\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity Corp. in 2016. \u201cInvestors we spoke with then largely did not support the Solar City acquisition, but worried there would be a more negative share price reaction in the event the transaction were voted down, given the perception of a vote of no confidence,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla shares jumped as much as 6.4% on Thursday, on the Musk post that the vote is passing. The company\u2019s shareholder meeting is scheduled to start around 4:30 p.m. New York time.\n\nStill, some investors worry that even a yes vote likely won\u2019t be enough to help Tesla shares sustain this latest momentum. The stock is down 29% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, falling behind the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 14% advance and the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 16% gain. Tesla now has a market value of about $565 billion, down from a peak of $1.24 trillion in 2021.\n\n\u201cNo matter the outcome of the vote, shares, which have already been under substantial pressure, have a list as long as a Walgreens receipt that needs to be addressed,\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.\n\nThe vote comes just over two weeks before Tesla is due to report its second-quarter delivery numbers. Sales for the first three months of the year had missed by a huge margin, and estimates for the current quarter have also been coming down rapidly in recent weeks. And then there\u2019s the lingering uncertainty about Tesla\u2019s so-called Robotaxi that the company plans to unveil in August.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, investors want to see earnings grow,\u201d said Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO at 50 Park Investments. \u201cOnce Tesla can show investors that earnings will steadily increase, the stock will most likely come back into favor.\u201d\n\nTop Tech News\n\nBroadcom Inc., a chip supplier for Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, is on track for its biggest surge in four years after its latest results topped estimates, lifted by robust demand for artificial intelligence products. MicroStrategy Inc. will offer $500 million in convertible notes to acquire more Bitcoin, the third sale of the securities this year by the enterprise-software maker that has made buying the cryptocurrency part of its corporate strategy. Samsung Electronics Co. unveiled a number of forthcoming advancements to its technology aimed at luring makers of AI chips to its manufacturing business. The National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, a trade group that represents music publishers and songwriters, filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday about Spotify Technology SA\u2019s decision to provide audiobooks to subscribers, which resulted in reduced royalty payments to songwriters. Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone walked away from a deal to sell her family\u2019s media empire to independent producer David Ellison, but she\u2019ll have to agree to an offer from someone eventually, because keeping the status quo isn\u2019t an option.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPostmarket\n\nAdobe\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GM To Reach EV Profitability By Year-End Despite Making Less EVs",
        "content": "GM To Reach EV Profitability By Year-End Despite Making Less EVs\n\nWith the EV adoption in the U.S. being slower than anticipated, General Motors (NYSE: GM) revised this year\u2019s expected EV sales and production, while being\u00a0launching its newest EVs, including its new entry-level Chevrolet Equinox EV. Along with the recent relaunch of Chevrolet Blazer EV after software issues got sorted out, these two EVs, both built on GM\u2019s Ultium EV platform, are crucial for the Detroit automaker\u2019s EV growth.\n\nEV Demand Is Growing, But Slower Than Expected\n\nPreviously targeting production between 200,000 and 300,000, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson stated the revised target for the full year is between 200,000 to 250,000 EVs. Some time ago, GM once expected to make as many as 400,000 EVs by mid 2024. However, GM is expecting its EV segment to become profitable\u00a0on a production, or contribution-margin basis once it makes 200,000 EVs, therefore, it expects to reach this milestone in the fourth quarter. On June 4th,\u00a0GM CEO Mary Barra clearly stated that GM remains committed to EVs, despite the mass industry slowdown, with May being the automaker\u2019s best EV sales month ever in North America. Even better days seem to be ahead as at the end of May, as its EV lineup got bigger with the mass-market Chevrolet Equinox EV priced at $35,000. Barra also added that ultimately, the pace of GM\u2019s EV development will be guided by customer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) reported that its new vehicle sales surged 88%\u00a0during the first five months of 2024, fueled by both EVs and hybrids that both grew about 65%. While the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) continues to struggle with its aging lineup, GM and Ford are improving their positioning on the EV front. Their Detroit peer, Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) is pursuing its EV goals despite a challenging macroeconomy and the EV slowdown. Back in March, Stellantis warned that a turbulent year ahead, much like Tesla CEO, Elon Musk. But, at the end of May, Stellantis CEO teased about\u00a0a\u00a0$25,000 all-electric Jeep EV coming to the U.S. very soon. Also in late May, Stellantis boss made sure to emphasize that Stellantis is not in a race to transition to EVs, but rather in a race to lower EV costs. On Thursday, Stellantis will have its Investor Day, where its leadership is expected to lay out the automaker\u2019s strategy, along with addressing the Chinese competition, its ambitious targets and forthcoming products, and possibly more cost-reductions.\n\nAlthough the EV slowdown is slowing down an EV titan like Tesla, it\u2019s turning out to be the best time for traditional automakers like GM and Ford who were struggling the keep up with the EV hype. Tesla kicked off 2024 with its first YoY sales drop in four years, suggesting it is in its flop era, while Ford began the year on a strong note and GM remained on track despite the discontinuation of the Chevy Bolt that weighted on EV sales. The first half of the year has almost passed and unlike Tesla, Ford and GM can tout their EV progress amid a gloomy and challenging macroenvironment.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Once-in-a-Lifetime Stocks on the Verge of a Serious Surge",
        "content": "When a stock looks beaten down enough, the imbalance of supply and demand oftentimes positions it just on the verge of a breakout. Many investors have a wealth-generating trading strategy by targeting these companies that seem overlooked by everyone around them. So when the market sentiment for certain stocks is at its lowest, historically it has been an interesting time to begin buying once in a lifetime stocks.\n\nAfter all, with a stock discounted so far below its fair value, its risks become negated and the potential outcome skews to the upside. Of course, this doesn\u2019t apply to every beaten-down stock. Beneath the surface, you still want to identify the companies that truly have a solid business model with growth potential. As such, this article will spotlight three companies that have the potential to bounce back with some seriously strong performances later this year.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is always making headlines in the financial world, whether positive or negative. So far in 2024, sentiment has unfortunately been negative, with the stock falling by nearly 30%. However, analysts on Wall Street are already banking on a comeback. The average price target sits at $182.51 and the high-end target is $320.00 which implies about an 80% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA lot of the future of Tesla\u2019s stock hinges on the much-discussed compensation package for CEO Elon Musk. If shareholders vote against it, Musk said he will take his AI technology to another company or even start a new one. For many analysts on the sidelines, without Musk and AI, Tesla\u2019s stock will plummet. But if Musk can stay on, Tesla\u2019s stock can see a massive upswing as it plays the catching-up game with countless other AI names.\n\nWhen looking at its valuation, we see that TSLA trades at 71x forward earnings and 6.5x sales. While this stock remains classified as a slightly pricey tech stock (as opposed to an automaker) its ten-year revenue CAGR of 47% makes its valuation easily justified. With a large discount currently at its all-time high, we suggest all investors look at the outcome for Tesla following the shareholder vote.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was once the darling of the fintech sector, its performance following the pandemic has not been friendly. Nonetheless, despite being down to nearly $67 after peaking at around $300 in 2021, Wall Street analysts have initiated a street-high target of up to $120. This implies that analysts see the potential for PayPal to trade as much as 80% higher than its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, why hasn\u2019t PayPal\u2019s stock recovered already? After all, the company has more than 427 million active accounts that processed over 6.5 billion transactions in just its first quarter alone. While this shortage in overall stock growth seems to be a harsh reversal after the drop in digital transactions post-COVID, Paypal is now eyeing the crypto world for a new growth avenue. In fact, PayPal\u2019s PYUSD stable coin very recently joined the Solana blockchain and could be a large growth driver for the next several years.\n\nLooking at its valuation, we see that its stock price drop of more than 40% over the past 5 years has put it at nearly 61% discount to its 5-year P/E average. Surprisingly, even during this downturn, PayPal has managed to grow revenue at a CAGR of 14%. For investors who missed PayPal\u2019s COVID boom, consider scooping up a few discounted shares for its potential once-in-a-lifetime surge heading into the growing crypto landscape.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is one of the two main global airplane manufacturers in the airplane supply business. Despite the troubles for Boeing this year, analysts still have an average price target of $220.27 and a street-high target of $275.00. If that high-end target hits, Boeing could have a surge of more than 50% this year.\n\nThere is not much to say about Boeing\u2019s issues this year as they are obvious by now. Multiple planes have had issues either upon landing or in mid-air with unfortunate repercussions. The problems are so bad that CEO Dave Calhoun has even announced his departure from the corner office. While this has shaken up the company recently, a new executive team could be the breath of fresh air this company sorely needs for future growth.\n\nShares of Boeing currently trade at 29x forward earnings and 1.5x sales. While recent sales numbers haven\u2019t been great for Boeing, its optimistic forward earnings could stabilize along with the company. If the right candidate is brought in to be the new CEO, they will have their work cut out for them. The good thing is, that as long as Boeing maintains its duopoly over the commercial plane market, a rebound is almost inevitable, making it one of the best once in a lifetime stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Lithium Stocks to Turn $1000 Into $1 Million: June 2024",
        "content": "Millionaire-maker lithium stocks are still in demand because of the growing need for lithium. This is illustrated by its market size, valued at $26.88 billion in 2023 and projected to grow by 22.1% to $134 billion by 2032.\n\nLithium is also necessary for lithium-ion batteries, which run electric automobiles, even if you disregard the material\u2019s economic potential on its own. \u2064\u2064Assuming a 20% worldwide market penetration rate and 17.5 million electric vehicle sales this year, the battery business will grow by 20.3% from $60.3 billion in 2024 to $182.5 billion by 2030.\n\nIn keeping with lithium\u2019s strategic significance, the U.S. Department of Energy is also providing $2.26 billion to the biggest lithium mine in North America, Nevada\u2019s Thacker Pass, to supply 800,000 electric vehicles with lithium.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the industry expanding, now is the time to buy millionaire-making lithium stocks. Remember Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a $5,000 investment at its IPO produced a million-dollar return. \u2064\u2064Investing in lithium pick-and-shovel plays that are primed to accomplish what Tesla did is the right move in the current market.\n\nSigma Lithium (SGML) a lithium mine, ATLX stock. Lithium Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSigma Lithium (NASDAQ:SGML) has the most upside of all the lithium millionaire-maker stocks at 118%. SGML\u2019s main emphasis is on the Brazilian lithium project, Grota do Cirilo, but the stock is down 55% so far this year.\n\nSigma Lithium\u2019s Grota do Cirilo project has increased its certified mineral resource by 27%. This makes it the world\u2019s fourth-largest industrial pre-chemical lithium extraction project. SGML has set a goal for the project of 150 million tons. Further, Sigma Lithium hopes to double output by the end of this year. For Q1 2025, SGML expects to increase its mineral reserves by 40% and produce 520,000 metric tons of commodities.\n\nSigma Lithium demonstrated its expansion in Q1 2024 by increasing its May shipping price by 25%. Sales of high-purity lithium concentrate brought in $49.1 million in revenue. In Q4 2023, the company reduced its cash expenses by 16%. At Grota do Cirilo, Sigma Lithium extended the project\u2019s life to 25 years and raised its proved and probable reserves to 77 million tons.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is one of the more risky millionaire-maker lithium stocks because its fortunes are so heavily tied to the Thacker Pass project in Nevada. But, a potential upside of over 142% is hard to ignore.\n\nDue to its strategic nature, the U.S. Department of Energy has promised a $2.26 billion loan to build a lithium carbonate manufacturing plant. This cash infusion is part of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program to support the national EV supply line. The factory will eventually generate up to 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate yearly, with the ultimate aim of 80,000 tons.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, LAC is pre-revenue, so from a financial standpoint, the only thing investors need to look into is progress with the mine. In its Q1 2024 earnings report, the business noted risks and the need for extra finance for Thacker Pass. However, progress on the Thacker Pass lithium project and other lithium activities is noteworthy.\n\nMajor construction on the Thacker Pass project will start in the second half of 2024 after regulatory approval and the DOE loan closure. After a six to twelve-month commissioning and ramp-up phase, the full-fledged opening will take place in 2028.\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera (NYSE:SQM) recently signed a deal with Codelco, Chile\u2019s state-owned copper company, under which the state enterprise will take over running the Salar de Atacama lithium mine. However, SQM will retain its position as the supplier until 2060. Additionally, SQM will grow its lithium carbonate equivalent mining by 300,000 metric tons.\n\nMeanwhile, LG Energy Solution and SQM are also partnering up under a long-term arrangement to sell over 100,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate and hydroxide for batteries.\n\nSQM\u2019s recent financial results balance the bullish thesis powered by these two deals. The Chilean chemical company did see revenue growth in Q1 2024 across its lithium, iodine, specialist nutrition and potassium divisions. Yet, the business still ended up losing $869.5 million as overall sales fell 52.1%.\n\nOn the bright side, SQM sold a record 43,000 metric tons of lithium, up 30% from 2023, and over 3,700 metric tons of iodine. The business bought the Andover lithium deposit in Western Australia and enlarged its Sichuan, China, Dixin lithium hydroxide conversion facility to 20,000 metric tons.\n\nRegarding the future, lithium demand will go over 1.1 million metric tons in 2024, according to CEO Ricardo Ramos, helping justify a potential upside of 25% per the analyst estimates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Anyone investing in renewable energy stocks knows that the past few years have been rough. High interest rates and weaker consumer sentiment have hit the sector hard. Many of these stocks are flashing buy signals now as they have been consolidating for years and building nice levels of support on their charts.\n\nRenewable energy companies will go through periods of prosperity and contraction as with any cyclical sector. The old saying is that the longer the consolidation, the more explosive the move when the stock is ready to break out. Renewable energy stocks are prepared to break out. Here are the three stocks we have our eyes on for June 2024!\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the largest pure-play solar companies in the world with a market cap of over $28 billion. Wall Street has always been all over the map with solar stock projections. The current average price target of FSLR is slightly lower than the current traded price, but the street-high target of $356 implies a near 40% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe solar industry was one of the hardest hit by the spike in global inflation and interest rates. After consolidating for the better part of the last two years, FSLR has rebounded well in 2024 in anticipation of upcoming rate cuts. So far, the stock has gained 55% this year with most of those gains coming since the middle of May.\n\nDespite the recent gains, FSLR still trades at 8x sales and 20x forward earnings. Both of these multiples are cheaper than the stock traded at the start of 2023 when the stock price was considerably lower. First Solar\u2019s gross margins are an impressive 43% compared to the industry average of 28.7%. If solar and renewables continue to rebound this year, FSLR should be at the top of the list.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) The Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of a digital American flag background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is the renewable energy arm of the massive Brookfield conglomerate of asset managers. The current price of BEP is slightly below the average Wall Street analyst target of $28.90, and about 30% lower than the high-end target of $34 per share.\n\nOwning Brookfield Renewable Partners is like owning a basket of diversified renewable energy assets. As of 2023, BEP owned 10,700 megawatts (MW) of hydro assets, 37,200 MW of wind, 75,300 MW of solar, and 26,400 MW of storage and other sources. Brookfield\u2019s footprint stretches across 30 different power markets in more than 20 countries worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of BEP trade at just 1.4x sales with a 10-year revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%. Brookfield is a corporation that is always looking to expand its holdings and aggressively acquire new infrastructure. On top of its stable growth, BEP also pays a dividend yield of more than 5% that pays shareholders quarterly. BEP is your best bet if you want to invest in renewables without the volatility.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost people automatically think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) when they think of electric vehicles (EV). But other companies like Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) are starting to take a share of the global EV market. Analysts have a one-year price target range of $10 to $36 with an average target of $15.92. The high-end target implies the potential for a more than 200% move higher!\n\nMuch has been made of Rivian\u2019s stock drop-off from its IPO. The company has battled the challenges of scaling production without running out of cash. For early EV investors, it is reminiscent of the challenges Tesla faced early on as well. Rivian recently announced three new lower-priced vehicles that should hit the market by 2026. Shareholders are hoping that this will have the same impact as when Tesla released the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.\n\nAs for the stock, RIVN is trading at historical lows compared to its revenue. Shares are trading at just 2.2x sales while significantly improving its revenues over the past three years. Tesla took years of consolidating at lower prices before exploding higher when it managed to scale operations into a profitable business. We believe that Rivian is going through the same cycle at this rock-bottom price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Rivian Stock Warning: Don\u2019t Buy the Hype on RIVN",
        "content": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is rising because of rumor and conjecture. Don\u2019t buy it. The electric vehicle manufacturer still has poor financials amid an ailing industry. With EVs likely to report lower growth this year than last year, there is little reason to expect Rivian to buck the trend.\n\nAlthough the EV stock is generating support, buying RIVN stock without firm commitments is just gambling. If there is something there, investors will have plenty of time to buy in later. But because it appears to be more smoke than fire, you will be better off sitting on the sidelines.\n\nWall Street Take Notice\n\nWall Street is changing its tune about Rivian. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas recently met with management and came away impressed. He said Rivian Automotive was \u201cuniquely positioned within autos (other than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) on scaling a fully integrated software stack critical to unlocking the AI opportunity.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet he offers caution, too. He notes the EV maker\u2019s stock \u201cis a balance of dilution risk vs. potential strategic partner rerate.\u201d Basically, investors need to balance the risk of Rivian heavily diluting their ownership stake in a bid to stay afloat while awaiting good news to come to speed up growth.\n\nHardly a ringing endorsement, but he has an overweight rating on RIVN stock and a $13 per share price target. With Rivian Automotive currently trading at almost $12 per share, there is not too much upside left.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Jonas\u2019 price target is on the low side. Wall Street has a consensus price target of $19 a share, implying an additional 60% upside to come.\n\nPartnerships Part of the Buy Thesis\n\nPart of the analyst\u2019s thesis for growth stems from partnerships Rivian can perhaps make with original equipment manufacturers to help them reduce their emissions through a vehicle\u2019s electronic control unit.\n\nRivian overhauled its electrical architecture to enhance generative artificial intelligence for its forthcoming R2 vehicle lineup. It will consolidate the number of ECUs in the vehicle, which might not sound like much, but can save the automaker thousands of dollars on each vehicle.\n\nECUs are in every vehicle, electric or gas-powered. The more technology a vehicle has the more ECUs it needs. Rivian has developed its own ECUs and software and now has embedded gen AI capabilities into it. The EV maker plans to offer that technology to help other automakers reduce their costs.\n\nJonas writes, \u201cRivian can explore partnerships with legacy OEMs on their network architecture to reduce ECUs.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem is, while that could produce a nice revenue stream for Rivian, it is unrelated to its primary business of making cars itself. It doesn\u2019t seem to be the sort of advance that will move the needle much in terms of revenue or profits, particularly if Rivian is losing money on the EVs it makes.\n\nThe Apple of Rivian\u2019s Eye\n\nThe other speculative note that sparked interest in Rivian stock was the possibility of a partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, there is no indication of what Apple might seek in a partnership or who the partner actually is. It is just rumor and fluff not built on any foundation whatsoever.\n\nIt is not likely to be anything AI-connected as Apple just said it was partnering with ChatGPT owner OpenAI to put the technology into its iPhone. At best Apple might put its CarPlay into a vehicle. Hardly a gamechanger for Rivian, so investors should completely discount the possibility.\n\nRivian Automotive\u2019s business is hurting. It reported worse-than-expected earnings last quarter and it continues to burn through cash at a high rate. Until Rivian can report positive news about actually selling more EVs, investors would do best just standing on the sidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Many investors can\u2019t figure out how to invest in penny stocks because they don\u2019t know what to look for. Some penny stocks are companies in beginning phases that have yet to scale up operations. These companies\u2019 financials are still in the process of improving. Other penny stocks may continue to trade at penny stock prices until there is a breakthrough \u2013such is common in the biotech industry\u2013 that grows the company\u2019s market share and stock price accordingly.\n\nRegardless, these share prices present a unique opportunity for investors for massive returns with such low share prices. Conversely, such low share prices make these stocks subject to market manipulation, making penny stocks volatile investments. You can find good penny stock picks by looking for improving financials, or analyzing public sentiment around a company\u2019s developments.\n\nPrevious penny stock successes include Amazon (NYSE:AMZN), AMD (NYSE:AMD) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). If you are wondering how to invest in penny stocks, here are three penny stocks that I\u2019ve identified as penny stock opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNerdy (NRDY) Image of a young girl raising her hand in front of a laptop.\n\nSource: MIA Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNerdy (NYSE:NRDY) is an online learning platform utilizing novel technology applications, such as Artificial Intelligence for Human Interaction (AI for HI), to improve customer experiences. Yahoo! Finance reports 9 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on NRDY between $3.75 and $6, with a mean of $4.64.\n\nNerdy has shown excellent financial promise for Q1 of 2024. The company has beaten both revenue and EPS earnings for Q1 of 2024. While profitability has been a weakness for Nerdy, a growing net profit margin and free cash flow indicates a positive future. By growing net income 60.61% year-over-year (YOY), management had a crucial role in improving profitability.\n\nThe company\u2019s flagship business of Varsity Tutors has positioned itself well for growth by establishing service partnerships with school districts in Illinois, Texas and Michigan. These programs are all funded by grants or offered at no costs to these districts, allowing for Nerdy to serve these communities while strategically growing its customer base. To prospective investors wondering how to invest in penny stocks, look no further than Nerdy.\n\nTaysha Gene Therapies (TSHA) OLK Stock.

RSLS stock. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaysha Gene Therapies (NASDAQ:THSA) focuses on clinical-stage research specifically for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Yahoo! Finance reports 10 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on TSHA between $5 and $9, with a mean of $6.75.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with most penny stock biotechnology companies, TSHA has not presented robust financials for Q1 of 2024. Operating expenses were $27.74 million, marking a 30.45% YOY increase. But this percentage is not unfounded. These expenditures have gone toward \u201cGood Manufacturing Practice\u201d activities, allowing TSHA to commercialize TSHA-102 \u2013a treatment for a CNS disease called Rett syndrome\u2013 that has currently garnered Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.\n\nWith the global Rett Syndrome market expected to grow at a 13.8% CAGR to $800 million by 2032, a lack of a cure or highly effective therapies position Taysha Gene Therapies to gain majority of the market share.\n\nGeron (GERN) Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA Stock\n\nSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeron (NASDAQ:GERN) specializes in developing and commercializing cancer therapies. Yahoo! Finance reports seven analysts predicting a 1-year price range on TSHA between $4.50 and $10, with a mean of $6.07.\n\nGERN financials have improved as of Q1 of 2024. The company\u2019s revenue is up 1,347% YOY and net profit margin is up 89.96% YOY. While GERN has shown substantial improvement with financials, these metrics are less impressive when you put these numbers in context. Net income for Q1 of 2024 was -$55.39 million, and the company is not yet profitable. However, I don\u2019t recommend GERN because of its financial performance.\n\nGeron gained FDA approval for RYTELO, which helps treat adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a form of onset leukemia. This FDA approval makes RYTELO the \u201cfirst-in-class\u201d treatment inhibiting telomerase growth, an enzyme that allows cancer cells to multiply. The potential for this type of treatment is widespread across different cancers, creating a lot of hype around this stock right now.\n\nGeron also has seven other treatments in development. Some include the further inhibition of telomerase although in other clinical applications. With multiple cutting edge developments that can potentially create massive upside, Geron is a highly recommended penny stock.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More:\u00a0Penny Stocks \u2014 How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Tesla shares jumped as much as 7.2% before the start of regular trading.\n\nMusk and Tesla\u2019s board have spent the last two months rallying support for the measures, putting particular emphasis on the pay deal that made Musk eligible for as much as $55.8 billion in stock options based on the company hitting certain milestones.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digested hawkish messages from the Federal Reserve as well as benign consumer prices, with more economic data due.\n\nAt 06:20 ET (10:20 GMT), Dow Jones Futures fell 155 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat and Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 100 points, or 0.5%.\n\nWall Street is coming off a largely strong session, with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite hitting all-time highs and closing at records. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average was the outlier, closing 0.1% lower.\n\nFed strikes hawkish chord, CPI inflation falls\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates steady as widely expected on Wednesday. But Chair Jerome Powell surprised markets by stating that the central bank was now set to cut rates only once this year, down from a prior estimate in March for three cuts.\n\nThe change in the Fed\u2019s stance came as more members saw signs of higher inflation in the country, with some policymakers also calling for no cuts this year. The central bank also raised its inflation outlook for the year.\n\nBut the Fed\u2019s hawkish messaging was somewhat offset by data showing consumer price index inflation eased slightly in May.\n\nThe May producer price index is due later in the session and is set to offer more cues on overall inflation, while the weekly jobless claims numbers will add details about the labor market.\n\nBroadcom shines\n\nThe rech sector has been in the spotlight this week, after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a slew of new AI features for its flagship devices, and that it was also partnering with OpenAI to implement some of the features, and cloud giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) announced AI partnerships with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThis focus is set to continue Thursday, as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) surged over 12% premarket after the chipmaker clocked bumper earnings on AI demand. The firm also announced a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nElsewhere, Dave&Buster\u2019s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock fell 10% after the company\u2019s first-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock gained 5% after CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post that shareholders are backing his $56 billion pay package and a move by the electric vehicle giant to reincorporate in Texas from Delaware.\n\nCrude slips on stockpile build\n\nCrude prices fell Thursday after a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories dented expectations of growing demand in the world's largest consumer.\n\nBy 06:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1% lower at $77.75 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.9% to $81.89 per barrel.\n\nStory continues\n\nGovernment data, released on Wednesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly grew by 3.7 million barrels in the first week of June, against expectations for a draw of 1.2 million barrels.\n\nOutsized builds in distillates and gasoline stockpiles also drove up concerns that fuel demand was not picking up with the summer season as expected.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures mixed; hawkish Fed, soft inflation send differing messages\n\nVirgin Galactic shares tumble on reverse stock split announcement\n\nReaction to Musk's post on voting for his $56 billion Tesla pay package\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholder resolutions for CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package and for the company to reincorporate in Texas from Delaware were seen passing by a wide margin, Musk said in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\nShareholders had begun voting on Musk\u2019s controversial pay package and the move to Texas this week, with Musk stating that both resolutions were seeing strong shareholder support so far.\n\n\"Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins! Thanks for your support!!,\" Musk said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nReuters also reported a similar trend in early voting, citing a source familiar with the preliminary tally.\n\nMusk\u2019s pay package- the highest seen for a corporate executive so far- was struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year after a slew of lawsuits and complaints from shareholders.\n\nThis week\u2019s vote will decide its reinstatement, and Tesla's reincorporation in Texas after Musk criticized unfavorable conditions in Delaware.\n\nSeveral major Tesla shareholders have already made their positions clear. Norges Bank, Nordea Asset and two California pension holders have signaled they intend to reject the package, while Tesla bull Baron Capital, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest and the Florida State Board of Administration said they will vote in favor of the resolution.\n\nBarclays analysts said in a recent note than failure to approve Musk\u2019s pay package was a major downside risk for Tesla, given that Musk had led the company to a $1 trillion valuation in recent years. Wedbush analysts had also cited a similar trend, and that sparring over the pay package was detrimental to Tesla.\n\nApproval of the pay package opens the door for Musk to receive up to nearly $56 billion in stock options, although a recent decline in Tesla\u2019s shares put the value closer to $45 billion.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMusk says Tesla resolutions for pay plan, Texas move passing by \"wide margin\"\n\nApple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AI spike sparks rally in Asian suppliers\n\nWhite House to nominate Goldsmith Romero soon, aiming for July hearing - source\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Elon Musk blasts Apple's OpenAI deal over alleged privacy issues. Does he have a point?",
        "content": "When Apple holds its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, its software announcements typically elicit cheers and excitement from tech enthusiasts.\n\nBut there was one notable exception this year \u2014 Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX chief executive threatened to ban all Apple devices from his companies, alleging a new partnership between Apple and Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI could pose security risks. As part of its new operating system update, Apple said users who ask Siri a question could opt in for Siri to pull additional information from ChatGPT.\n\n\"Apple has no clue what's actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,\" Musk wrote on X. \"They're selling you down the river.\"\n\nThe partnership allows Siri to ask iPhone, Mac and iPad users if the digital assistant can surface answers from OpenAI's ChatGPT to help address a question. The new feature, which will be available on certain Apple devices, is part of the company's operating system update due later this year.\n\n\"If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,\" Musk wrote on X. \"That is an unacceptable security violation.\"\n\nRead more:Apple announces deal with OpenAI. Will it be a game-changer?\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a keynote presentation at its developers conference on Monday, Apple said ChatGPT would be free for iPhone, Mac and iPad users. Under the partnership, Apple device users would not need to set up a ChatGPT account to use it with Siri.\n\n\"Privacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT \u2014 their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won\u2019t store requests,\" Apple said on its website. \"ChatGPT\u2019s data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.\"\n\nMany of Apple's AI models and features, which the company collectively calls \"Apple Intelligence,\" run on the device itself, but some inquiries will require information to be sent through the cloud. Apple said that data is not stored or made accessible to Apple and that independent experts can inspect the code that runs on the servers to verify this.\n\nApple Intelligence will be available for certain models of Apple devices, such as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad and Mac with M1 and later.\n\nSo does Musk have a point? Technology and security experts who spoke to The Times offered mixed opinions.\n\nSome pushed back on Musk's assertion that Apple's OpenAI deal poses security risks, citing a lack of evidence.\n\n\"Like a lot of things that Elon Musk says, it's not based upon any kind of technical reality now, it's really just based upon his political beliefs,\" said Alex Stamos, chief trust officer at Mountain View, Calif.-based cybersecurity company SentinelOne. \"There's no real factual basis for what he said.\"\n\nStamos, who is also a computer science lecturer at Stanford University and a former chief security officer at Facebook, said he was impressed with Apple's data protection efforts, adding, \"They're promising a level of transparency that nobody's really ever provided.\n\n\"It's hard to totally prove at this point, but what they've laid out is about the best you could do to provide this level of AI services running on people's private data while protecting their privacy,\" Stamos said.\n\n\"To do the things that people have become accustomed to from ChatGPT, you just can't do that on phones yet,\" Stamos added. \"We're years away from being able to run those kinds of models on something that fits in your pocket and doesn't burn a hole in your jeans from the amount of power it burns.\"\n\nRead more:AI companies are courting Hollywood. Do they come in peace?\n\nMusk has been critical of OpenAI. He sued the company in February for breach of contract and fiduciary duty, alleging it had shifted its focus from an agreement to develop artificial general intelligence \"for the benefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits.\" On Tuesday, Musk, who was a co-founder of and investor in OpenAI, withdrew his lawsuit. Musk's San Francisco company, xAI, is a competitor to OpenAI in the fast-growing field of artificial intelligence.\n\nMusk has taken aim at Apple in the past, calling it a \"Tesla graveyard,\" because, according to him, Apple had hired people that Tesla had fired. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple,\" Musk said in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt in 2015. \"I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d\n\nStill, Rayid Ghani, a machine learning and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said that, at a high level, he thinks the concerns Musk raised about the OpenAI-Apple partnership should be raised.\n\nWhile Apple said that OpenAI is not storing Siri requests, \"I don't think we should just take that at face value,\" Ghani said. \"I think we need to ask for evidence of that. How does Apple ensure that processes are there in place? What is the recourse if it doesn't happen? Who's liable, Apple or OpenAI, and how do we deal with issues?\"\n\nSome industry observers also have raised questions about the option for Apple users who have a ChatGPT account to link it with their iPhone, and what information is collected by OpenAI in that case.\n\n\"We have to be careful with that one \u2014 linking your account on your mobile phone is a big deal,\" said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. \"I personally would not link until there is a lot more clarity about what happens to the data.\"\n\nRead more:Scarlett Johansson also thinks OpenAI's new voice sounds like her. She's not happy about it\n\nOpenAI pointed to a statement on its website that says, \"Users can also choose to connect their ChatGPT account, which means their data preferences will apply under ChatGPT\u2019s policies.\" The company declined further comment.\n\nUnder OpenAI's privacy policy, the company says it collects personal information that is included in the input, file uploads or feedback when account holders use its service. ChatGPT has a way for users to opt out of having their inquiries used to train AI models.\n\nAs the use of AI becomes more entwined with people's lives, industry observers say that it will be crucial to provide transparency for customers and test the trustworthiness of the AI tools.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have to understand something about AI. It\u2019s going to be a lot like plumbing. It\u2019s going to be built into our devices and our lives everywhere,\" Dixon said. \"The AI is going to have to be trustworthy and we\u2019re going to need to be able to test that trustworthiness.\"\n\nNight Archiving Supervisor Valerie Hood contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big name Tesla Inc. investors are weighing in on Elon Musk\u2019s hotly contested pay package that heads to a vote on Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Broadly Cools in Encouraging Sign for Fed Officials Blinken Casts Doubt on Cease-Fire Hopes After Hamas Responds EU to Slap Tariffs of Up to 48% on EV Imports From China Britain\u2019s \u2018Quiet Quitters\u2019 Are Costing the Economy \u00a3257 Billion Asia\u2019s Family Office Frenzy Comes With Plenty of Imposters\n\nThis will mark the second time shareholders have a say on this plan for the chief executive officer\u2019s compensation. The measure easily passed in 2018, but in January a judge in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, struck it down, saying that investors weren\u2019t fully informed of key details.\n\nUnder the plan, Musk was eligible for as much as $55.8 billion in stock options if Tesla hit certain milestones, which the company reached. The current value of the options is closer to $45 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nInvestors who are willing to comment publicly are so far split on the vote, which serves as an advisory to the board. Some worry Musk would leave the company if the package isn\u2019t reinstated. The CEO has said he would develop products outside of Tesla if he doesn\u2019t own about 25% of the company. He currently controls about half that. If the deal is brought back, Musk could almost double his holdings to roughly 21%.\n\nAs of midday Wednesday, a number of Tesla\u2019s largest investors including Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street have yet to disclose how they plan to vote. Here's a rundown of where some other big shareholders stand:\n\nInstitutional Investors\n\nBaillie Gifford & Co. Asset manager\n\nShares: 17.8 million (0.56%)Musk pay package: SupportsRationale: The Scottish asset manager is expected to vote in favor of Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package, according to a person familiar with the matter. Baillie Gifford was the company\u2019s second largest investor a few years ago, but has since reduced its stake.\n\nRon Baron Chief Executive Officer and founder, Baron Funds\n\nShares: 17.2 million (0.54%)Musk pay package: SupportsRationale: Baron, a longtime Tesla investor, said in an open letter backing Musk\u2019s package that the will of the shareholders who voted in 2018 should be favored. Without Musk, there would \u201cbe no Tesla,\u201d and this vote might determine whether he stays at the company, Baron said.\n\nCathie WoodCEO and Founder, Ark Investment Management\n\nShares: 5.2 million (0.16%)Musk pay package: SupportsRationale: Wood is a longtime Tesla bull and has repeatedly lauded Musk for pushing the company to the front of the EV market. \u201cHe succeeded spectacularly and should be rewarded accordingly,\u201d she said in a recent post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nStory continues\n\nGavin BakerManaging Partner and Chief Investment Officer, Atreides Management\n\nShares: 153,000 (0.005%)Musk pay package: SupportsRationale: In a post on X, Baker said approving the pay package is the right thing to do and that Tesla\u2019s stock will go up if the compensation agreement is reinstated and down if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nNorges Bank Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund\n\nShares: 31.6 million (1%)Musk pay package: OpposesRationale: Concerns remain about \u201cthe total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d the wealth fund said in a statement. The investor also voted against Musk\u2019s pay package in 2018.\n\nMarcie FrostCEO, California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System\n\nShares: 9.5 million (0.3%)Musk pay package: Leaning opposeRationale: \u201cWe do not believe that the compensation is commensurate with the performance of the company,\u201d Frost said in a recent interview on CNBC. She said CALPERS would likely vote against the package.\n\nChris AilmanChief Investment Officer, California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System\n\nShares: 4.6 million (0.14%)Musk pay package: OpposesRationale: The pension is voting no on the package \u201cbased on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company,\u201d CalSTRS said in a statement.\n\nBrad LanderComptroller, New York City\n\nShares: 3.4 million (0.1%)Musk pay package: OpposesRationale: Lander signed onto a letter from a group of investors urging peers to reject the package. The board\u2019s initial reason in 2018 for taking such action was to incentivize Musk to keep focused on Tesla, but he hasn\u2019t done that, the letter said. Musk is distracted by his commitments to the other companies he controls and isn\u2019t serving the carmaker\u2019s best interests, the group said.\n\nAmalgamated Bank New York-based financial institution\n\nShares: 599,000 (0.02%)Musk pay package: OpposesRationale: The bank joined Lander, the New York City Comptroller, in signing a letter from a group of investors that pushed other shareholders to vote no. The letter said Musk has a lack of focus because of his responsibilities at other companies.\n\nRetail Investors\n\nMusk claimed in a recent post on X that roughly 90% of retail investors that had voted so far had been in favor of the pay package and change in incorporation. Several big names have weighed in publicly so far.\n\nLeo KoGuanCo-Founder, SHI International\n\nShares: Not disclosedMusk pay package: OpposesRationale: KoGuan, reportedly one of Tesla\u2019s largest individual shareholders, said he\u2019s voting no and called Musk a \u201cserial stock options killer\u201d in a series of posts on X. The executive has been a frequent critic of Musk\u2019s management.\n\nNaval RavikantCo-Founder, AngelList\n\nShares: Not disclosedMusk pay package: SupportsRationale: The venture capitalist, who is best known for founding AngelList, called the overturning of Musk\u2019s pay package by a Delaware court \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t pass, he said he\u2019ll sell his Tesla stock, but would buy more if it\u2019s approved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown The Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon As Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Food Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Elon Musk, called every name from \u2018carnival barker\u2019 to \u2018absent CEO,\u2019 is on the verge of landing a $45 billion pay package from Tesla",
        "content": "After a judge took awayTesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $45 billion pay package, shareholders seem on the cusp of giving it back.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla\u2019s shareholders will vote on whether or not to approve Musk\u2019s uniquely structured, all-or-nothing pay package. Initially passed in 2018, the pay proposal was praised by Tesla\u2019s board and shareholders because it was seen as a moonshot, requiring Musk to hit near-impossible goals before he saw any pay. But six years later, after those targets had been hit, the pay was invalidated by a judge, and Tesla\u2019s board was accused of mismanagement.\n\nThe size of the pay package combined with Musk\u2019s own status as a superstar entrepreneur and celebrity CEO has turned what should otherwise be a humdrum bit of corporate governance into an international news story. Musk\u2019s fiercest critics see the record-setting pay as the sign of an executive with outsize influence over Tesla\u2019s board, which includes his brother and friends. Supporters, on the other hand, credit Musk with building the company from the ground up and say objections to his pay are only being raised now because he successfully reached all the incentives laid out for him.\n\nAs it stands, the fate of Musk\u2019s compensation package is still up in the air. High-profile backers, including the likes of Baron Capital and ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, a longtime supporter of Musk, have come out in favor. Planning to vote no are Norwegian sovereign wealth fund Norges Bank Investment Management, managers of pension funds in New York and California, and investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. Lingering on the sidelines are major asset managers such as the Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street Corp., which haven\u2019t declared publicly how they\u2019ll vote but\u2014because of their size\u2014could be the deciding factor. Adding another wrinkle are the many retail investors that collectively own 43% of Tesla\u2019s common stock. On Saturday, Musk said on X that 90% of retail shareholders who had already voted had backed the compensation plan.\n\nSome management experts disagree. The promise of superhuman pay helped drive some of Musk\u2019s more erratic behavior, according to J. Bradford DeLong, professor of economic history at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cI believe this pay package helped drive his descent from visionary business leader to bizarre carnival barker,\u201d DeLong wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times. \u201cAnd that set of incentives and responses should not be validated.\u201d\n\nIs high pay good management?\n\nMusk\u2019s pay package was originally approved in 2018 when 73% of shareholders voted in favor of the plan. At one point the package was worth $56 billion, but its value has since declined to $45 billion, as Tesla\u2019s stock dropped. After Musk hit his targets, a group of disgruntled shareholders sued to block the move in a Delaware court. Kathaleen McCormick, the judge in the case, ruled to reverse the pay plan, citing that the board had not been sufficiently independent.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is a view that some shareholders agreed with. Tesla\u2019s board is \u201cacting like a family owned business when it\u2019s a publicly traded business,\u201d New York City comptroller Brad Lander told CNBC.\n\nGerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber, who has called Musk an \u201cabsent CEO\u201d and said Tesla needs to have a \u201creal CEO,\u201d noted that Elon deserves compensation but excoriated the board for what he deemed poor conduct. The \u201cboard of directors sucks, to be honest,\u201d Gerber told CNBC. \u201cThey just stink. I\u2019ve never seen such a bad board. It\u2019s going to be written about in business schools for years to come to study what a horrendous board Tesla has.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s board chair Robyn Denholm said it was \u201cabsolute BS\u201d she wasn\u2019t independent of Musk, as McCormick had suggested.\n\nOther shareholders criticized Musk himself. A constant sore spot for institutional investors, both those who hail Musk as a visionary and those who detest his personal politics, is his perceived lack of focus. Musk is often criticized for splitting his attention between his various other companies, which include X, SpaceX, and the Boring Co. In an interview with Fortune last month, Lander said the board let Musk focus on his other companies. \u201cEvery other major publicly traded company with a genuinely independent board\u2014and many of them with not that independent of a board\u2014expect their CEO to be a full-time CEO for their company,\u201d Lander said.\n\nChris Ailman, the chief investment officer of CalSTRS, a California pension fund, said Musk is juggling a \u201cmillion balls in the air\u201d and should just focus on a few. Musk\u2019s top preference, according to Ailman, is the space travel currently being explored at SpaceX.\n\n\u201cHe wants to go to Mars, let him fly away,\u201d Ailman said, half joking.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk and his companies are embroiled in dozens of lawsuits, ranging from fatal crashes blamed on Tesla Inc.\u2019s Autopilot system to civil rights complaints over the treatment of employees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHunter Biden Was Convicted.

US Inflation Broadly Cools in Encouraging Sign for Fed Officials Blinken Casts Doubt on Cease-Fire Hopes After Hamas Responds Stock Bull Run Breaks Record on Fed Decision Day: Markets Wrap Fed Officials Dial Back Rate Forecasts, Signal Just One \u201824 Cut\n\nTesla\u2019s board and Musk were hit June 6 with another suit over his $56 billion pay package that a judge voided in January \u2014 ahead of a June 13 shareholder proxy vote on whether the company should resurrect it.\n\nMusk, who has a history of sparring with regulators, also faces government investigations into his companies that could result in more lawsuits or even criminal prosecutions.\n\nBloomberg News has identified more than half a dozen ongoing legal fights in which Musk is a defendant or a plaintiff, as well as about a dozen others involving his companies. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the major legal battles faced by the world\u2019s third-richest person and his companies:\n\nTESLA INC.\n\nAutopilot Crashes, California and Florida state and federal courts\n\nThe electric-car maker faces at least half a dozen wrongful death claims over fatal crashes blamed on its Autopilot driver-assistance system.\n\nAt stake: A finding that Tesla is culpable for deaths would imperil Musk\u2019s quest to lead the way for fully self-driving cars to cruise down busy city streets and freeways.\n\nRace Discrimination, California state and federal courts\n\nTesla faces multiple suits over allegations of racism on its production floor filed by workers, California\u2019s civil rights department and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nAt stake: The automaker could have to pay damages and foster a more inclusive environment.\n\nPay Package, Delaware Chancery Court\n\nMusk is poised to appeal a judge\u2019s decision voiding his Tesla pay package as excessive, while Tesla plans to ask shareholders at the company\u2019s June 13 annual meeting to ratify the same compensation plan approved six years ago. A new suit alleges Musk is trying to strong-arm shareholders into resurrecting the record-setting pay package through a proxy vote.\n\nAt stake: Musk has suggested the largest-ever executive pay package is necessary for him to have \u201cthe right amount of voting influence at Tesla,\u201d so he can grow it to be a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nAnti-Union Tweet, federal appeals court in New Orleans\n\nStory continues\n\nA 17-judge panel is reviewing a finding by the National Labor Relations Board that Musk illegally threatened workers with the loss of benefits if they unionized.\n\nAt stake: A ruling condemning the CEO\u2019s commentary on social media would be a comeuppance for Musk and a morale boost for labor activists who are trying to organize Tesla workers.\n\nDrug Use, Delaware Chancery Court\n\nA shareholder suit alleges that Musk\u2019s use of illicit recreational drugs threatens Tesla\u2019s business, including by apparently influencing his sometimes erratic behavior online.\n\nAt stake: The lawsuit seeks closer supervision of Musk\u2019s social media posts about Tesla, which are already supposed to be vetted under an agreement he reached in 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and unsuccessfully challenged all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n\nFalse Advertising, California federal courts\n\nTesla faces numerous lawsuits claiming misrepresentations to consumers, including that the company inflated how far its electric vehicles drive on a charge and over-hyped their driving-assistance capabilities.\n\nAt stake: The lawsuits take aim at features Tesla promotes to distinguish itself from competitors and are core to the company\u2019s market value.\n\nJPMorgan Stock Warrants, New York federal court\n\nJPMorgan sued Tesla seeking a $162 million payment related to a series of stock warrant transactions dating back to 2014, and Tesla later countersued the bank.\n\nAt stake: If the case goes to trial, Musk\u2019s infamous 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private that is central to the dispute will once again haunt the company.\n\n\u2018Insider\u2019 Sale of $7.5 Billion in Stock, Delaware Chancery Court\n\nA Tesla shareholder alleges Musk had inside knowledge of a miss on production and delivery numbers that the company was facing when he sold more than $7.5 billion in stock in 2022 to help pay for his acquisition of Twitter Inc.\n\nAt stake: The investor wants Musk to be ordered return the profit from his allegedly improper trading to the company.\n\nX CORP.\n\nEmployee Pay, California state and federal courts\n\nX Corp., formerly Twitter, has been accused in multiple suits of labor and workplace violations in the wake of mass layoffs after Musk\u2019s 2022 acquisition, including reneging on promises to pay severance to executives and thousands of workers.\n\nAt stake: Collectively, the lawsuits seek hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay.\n\nUnpaid Bills, California state courts\n\nX has been accused in multiple suits of failing to pay vendors and landlords after Musk took over the company and set about cutting operating costs.\n\nAt stake: Collectively, the complaints cite millions of dollars of unpaid expenses.\n\nTwitter Takeover, California federal court\n\nMusk faces an investor lawsuit claiming he fueled uncertainty about his proposed buyout in an effort to drive down the platform\u2019s stock price.\n\nAt stake: The investors seek unspecified damages over stock value losses.\n\nContent Moderation, California federal court\n\nX has sued non-profits that have issued reports criticizing toxic posts on the platform and faulting the company for lax content moderation.\n\nAt stake: X already lost one suit, but if it can prove its claim in the other case that a series of published articles are false and malicious attacks aimed at driving advertisers away, Musk\u2019s company could win monetary damages.\n\nSPACEX CORP.\n\nRetaliatory Firings, California\n\nSpaceX was accused by the NLRB of illegally firing eight employees over an internal letter sharply critical of Musk.\n\nAt stake: The company could be forced to reinstate the workers or provide back pay, but the US labor board generally can\u2019t hold executives personally liable for alleged wrongdoing or issue any punitive damages.\n\nSexual Harassment, California state court\n\nThe eight fired SpaceX employees who complained to the NLRB have also sued Musk over the alleged retaliation as well as sexual harassment. They claim Musk brought into the workplace \u201cvile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d\n\nAt stake: Unlike the NLRB complaint, the lawsuit could hold Musk personally liable for alleged wrongdoing and result in punitive damages.\n\nUS Labor Board, California federal court\n\nSpaceX sued the NLRB to have the agency\u2019s structure for in-house administrative proceedings declared unconstitutional after the board filed its complaint over fired SpaceX employees.\n\nAt stake: A victory for SpaceX could hobble the authority of the federal labor rights watchdog.\n\nGender Discrimination, California state court\n\nSpaceX faces multiple gender-discrimination suits, including allegations that female employees are underpaid relative to men and subject to sexual harassment.\n\nAt stake: A loss for the company would hurt its reputation and might discourage talented female engineers and managers from seeking employment.\n\nWildlife Area Launchpad, DC federal court\n\nSpaceX\u2019s use of a rocket launchpad neighboring a Texas wildlife refuge drew a lawsuit from environmental groups over how the site won approval from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAt stake: The environmental scrutiny could delay future licensing for the company.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nMusk v. OpenAI, California state court\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and its Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman for allegedly putting profit ahead of humanity in violation of the startup\u2019s founding mission. But Musk dropped the litigation on June 11.\n\nAt stake: Musk voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, which lawyers said was a long-shot, one day before OpenAI was scheduled to argue for its dismissal before a judge. Musk, who tends to see court fights through to the bitter end rather than conceding, reserved the right to revive his claims.\n\nFired Disney Actor, California federal court\n\nMusk is funding a lawsuit against Walt Disney Co. by The Mandalorian actor Gina Carano over controversial statements she posted on X.\n\nAt stake: As a \u201cfree-speech absolutist,\u201d Musk has promised to pay legal fees for people fired from jobs for statements they made on the platform.\n\n\u2018False Flag\u2019 Defamation, Texas state court\n\nMusk faces a defamation suit for allegedly promoting a conspiracy theory that falsely identified a California Jewish man as involved in a scheme to discredit right-wing groups by posing as a neo-Nazi street brawler.\n\nAt stake: Ben Brody, who filed the lawsuit, is seeking at least $1 million in damages.\n\nDogecoin Cryptocurrency, New York federal court\n\nMusk, SpaceX and Tesla were sued for allegedly participating in a racketeering scheme to inflate the price of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin.\n\nAt stake: The lawsuit initially included a claim for $258 billion in damages, but an amended complaint removed any specific figure.\n\nGOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\nTesla Self-Driving\n\nThe Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission launched investigations in 2021 and 2022 about whether Tesla made misleading claims about its vehicles\u2019 purported self-driving capabilities.\n\nAt stake: The probes could result in a regulatory enforcement action or criminal charges against Tesla.\n\nGlass House\n\nThe SEC and Justice Department last year started investigating whether Tesla improperly used company funds to build a glass house in Texas and whether Musk was involved, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAt stake: The probes could result in a regulatory enforcement action over securities law violations or criminal charges against Tesla.\n\nTwitter Stock Purchases\n\nThe SEC is seeking information about Musk\u2019s 2022 purchases of Twitter stock and statements he made about his investments ahead of his $44 billion purchase of the social media platform.\n\nAt stake: The probe could lead to an enforcement action over securities law violations and possible fines for Musk.\n\nX Privacy\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission is monitoring X over its compliance with a May 2022 settlement over data privacy practices reached prior to Musk\u2019s takeover.\n\nAt stake: Violations of the settlement could lead to millions of dollars in fines or even criminal charges against individuals.\n\n(Updates with new sexual-harassment lawsuit.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics As Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Food Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Will Tesla (TSLA) Shareholders Approve Musk's Huge Pay Package?",
        "content": "Tomorrow will be a significant day for Tesla TSLA as shareholders will conclude voting on the much-controversial pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The results, set to be released during Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on June 13, will determine the fate of Musk\u2019s compensation deal, initially approved in 2018 but later invalidated by a Delaware court. The stakes are high and the decision is expected to have significant ramifications not only for Musk's compensation but also for Tesla\u2019s future.\n\nBackground on TSLA CEO\u2019s Controversial Pay Package\n\nMusk does not draw a salary from Tesla or receive any cash bonus but owns around 13% stake in the company currently. In 2018, he proposed a performance-based pay structure for himself. Around 73% of the independent shareholders voted in favor of the hefty package of around $56 billion in 2018.\n\nMusk\u2019s package consisted of stock options that would vest only if Tesla met a series of ambitious market capitalization and operational goals. The targets included increasing Tesla's market value from $59 billion to $650 billion and hitting revenue milestones of up to $175 billion or an adjusted EBITDA of $14 billion by 2028.\n\nDespite achieving these targets and driving Tesla's market cap to heights once deemed unachievable, the compensation package faced legal challenges. Earlier this year, a Delaware court invalidated the deal, ruling that Tesla's board did not act in the best interest of shareholders when approving such an extravagant package. This ruling not only angered Musk but also set the stage for a fresh shareholder vote and discussions about moving Tesla\u2019s headquarters to Texas.The upcoming vote will also include a decision on the headquarters shift.\n\nTo address the judge\u2019s objections to Musk\u2019s pay package, Tesla put the package up for a new vote. Shareholders are deciding whether to reapprove a compensation plan currently valued at approximately $46 billion (based on the current market cap of TSLA). While votes have been coming in for weeks, the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nWhy Proponents Believe Musk Deserves the Package\n\nSupporters of Musk\u2019s pay package argue that he has more than earned his compensation. From 2018 through 2023 end, Tesla has seen its market value skyrocket, delivering a total shareholder return of more than 1,000%.\n\nTesla's board, led by chairperson Robyn Denholm, has emphasized that the company has met all the performance targets set out in the original pay package. In an April proxy statement, Denholm reiterated that Musk\u2019s achievements justify the compensation, arguing that failing to honor the original deal would be unjust.\n\nStory continues\n\nProponents, including influential investors like Ron Baron of Baron Capital, assert that Musk\u2019s leadership and vision are indispensable to Tesla's success. In a letter to shareholders, Baron emphasized that Musk is integral to Tesla\u2019s identity and that the CEO has \u201cearned his pay.\u201d He stated, \u201cShareholders should ask themselves this question: is Tesla better off with or without Elon? Our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon. Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d\n\nOpposition From Proxy Advisors and ISS\n\nDespite strong support from certain quarters, the compensation package faces significant opposition. Proxy advisory firms such as Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) have recommended voting against the reapproval. These firms argue that the deal is excessively generous and potentially undermines shareholder rights.\n\nMoreover, concerns about corporate governance and the concentration of power in Musk\u2019s hands have been raised. Musk already holds a substantial stake in Tesla, valued at approximately $75 billion, which critics argue should be sufficient to ensure his commitment to the company. The worry is that the pay package might further consolidate his control, reducing the board\u2019s ability to check his influence.\n\nThe Role of Individual Investors & Musk\u2019s Influence\n\nThe outcome of the vote is expected to hinge on the participation of individual investors. While institutional investors hold significant sway, individual shareholders, many of whom are ardent Musk supporters, could tip the balance. Musk has actively campaigned for their support, using social media and attending meetings with large investors to garner votes. Tesla\u2019s board has strongly recommended a \u201cyes\u201d vote, arguing that Musk\u2019s continued leadership is vital for the company\u2019s future.\n\nNotably, Musk himself has made it clear that his commitment to Tesla is conditional on maintaining significant control. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter) in January, he expressed discomfort with growing Tesla\u2019s AI and robotics capabilities without having approximately 25% voting control. This statement has fueled speculation that Musk might shift his focus to his other ventures if the pay package is not reapproved, potentially impacting Tesla\u2019s innovation and growth trajectory.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIndeed, Musk and Tesla have become synonymous over the years. Musk has successfully navigated the company through both good and bad times. Against all odds, Tesla and its visionary CEO have not only survived but thrived. The company transitioned from unprofitability to profitability, demonstrating a viable market for EVs.\n\nThe upcoming shareholder vote on Elon Musk\u2019s pay package is a critical juncture for the company. Although the pay package is massive and could potentially decrease shareholders\u2019 rights, it would seem unfair to renege on the original deal now that Musk has fulfilled his end of the bargain.\n\nShould the package be approved, it would signal a renewed vote of confidence in Musk's leadership and potentially motivate him to continue driving Tesla's ambitious projects, including advancements in AI and autonomous driving technology. A favorable vote is expected to spark a rally in Tesla shares. Given that the stock is currently at multi-year lows and heavily shorted (TSLA was the most shorted large-cap stock in May), the approval could drive significant upward momentum.However, a rejection could weaken Tesla\u2019s position in its appeal against the Delaware judge's ruling and might impact Musk\u2019s focus on the company, spiraling the stock down. All eyes are on tomorrow's vote results.\n\nTSLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Oracle's Cloud Efforts Receive A Much-Needed Validation",
        "content": "Oracle's Cloud Efforts Receive A Much-Needed Validation\n\nOn Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) posted its\u00a0fiscal fourth-quarter earnings\u00a0that were below estimates.\u00a0But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that\u00a0Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$14.55 billion.\u00a0Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle\u2019s cloud unit is growing faster.\u00a0The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion.\n\nAdjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.65.\u00a0Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share.\n\nPartnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum\n\nThe aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to\u00a0extend Azure Al to\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl.\u00a0Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure.\u00a0As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges.\u00a0Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle\u2019s cloud database growth.\n\nOutlook Shaped By The AI Hype\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year ending in May 2025,\u00a0Catz\u00a0expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads,\u00a0adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand.\n\nShifting focus away from weak Q4 financials.\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st.\u00a0Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies\u00a0analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won\u2019t last forever.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy After the Trump-Musk Palm Beach Breakfast Meeting",
        "content": "Are two of the Internet\u2019s most maligned men, former President Donald Trump and industrial powerhouse Elon Musk, joining forces? It seems that way, which creates a unique opportunity for those looking for stocks to buy ahead of the election.\n\nThe two had breakfast in March in Florida to discuss plans to forecast, identify and mitigate potential voter fraud in the upcoming election. Musk\u2019s X platform is a prime source of potential misinformation and election-influencing content, so the collaboration is only natural. Better yet, Musk plans to platform a Trump town hall on X in the coming weeks, saying simply, \u201cThis will be interesting,\u201d while X CEO Linda Yaccarino dubbed it \u201cThe People\u2019s Town Hall.\u201d\n\nBeyond the known facts, sources close to Donald Trump claim he may leverage Musk\u2019s unique insight and seemingly boundless energy in a White House role as policy advisor if he wins the vote in November. Some call Musk the \u201cmost important business player in U.S. politics,\u201d which, while somewhat hyperbolic, still rings true as Musk becomes increasingly forthright with his political opinions on X.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPerhaps more impactful to the big picture, Musk serving in an advisory capacity could help Trump better understand public sentiment and how to best position himself moving forward, considering the depths of data X can aggregate. Likewise, this could help better position Donald Trump ahead of the election, as some see his current policy emphases as far more lukewarm and tepid than those that propelled him to power initially.\n\nNo matter what, with lines of communication between Donald Trump and Elon Musk clearly wide open, these stocks to buy may stand to gain from their current \u2014 and potential future \u2014 relationship.\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the clear winner among stocks to buy amid Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s growing relationship. While not explicitly implying any unfair advantage to the automaker, Trump\u2019s past disdain for the electric vehicle industry could soften if Musk can effectively pitch an \u201cAmerica first\u201d EV perspective. A policy pivot of this type is particularly relevant considering the current push from Chinese EV manufacturers to expand their footprint in Mexico, which creates an easy inroad for sales and market penetration farther north.\n\nTheir relationship already seems to be bearing fruit, as Trump recently said at a rally that he\u2019s \u201ca big fan of electric cars [and] a fan of Elon\u201d and that Musk \u201cdoes an incredible job with Tesla.\u201d The June 6th remarks didn\u2019t help Tesla stock much, as per-share pricing fell by about 2% since then. Still, the current share pricing concerns largely center around Musk\u2019s pay package deliberations. If the shareholder vote shakes out in his favor, Tesla could be among the top stocks to buy if you want to capture Musk and Trump\u2019s emerging political alliance.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAAC) is one stock that captures three of the most polarizing figures in global politics today: Elon Musk, Donald Trump and Argentina\u2019s president Javier Milei. Milei and Musk met previously, and each touted Argentina\u2019s lithium-rich resources, with Milei affirming a plan to ease operational barriers to lithium mining both before and after his Musk meeting. Likewise, Milei and Trump already have an existing relationship, with Milei modeling his Argentinian campaign after Trump\u2019s (including \u201cMake Argentina Great Again\u201d hats).\n\nThe wider lithium market, and Lithium Americas stock in particular, suffered in recent months as global oversupply and reduced demand crushed the metal\u2019s spot pricing. Still, analysts expect the supply/demand misalignment will soon reverse and project a 30% annual demand increase through 2030. That places Lithium Americas at a unique intersection among stocks to buy: cheap today with emerging tailwinds and bolstered by Elon Musk and Donald Trump\u2019s focus on rightsizing American manufacturing and South American political relations.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020.

PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile perhaps a more peripheral stock to buy in light of Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s meeting series, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) nevertheless captures multiple market segments exhibiting bullish tendencies. Palantir, of course, is a key player in ongoing Middle Eastern conflicts and is firmly entrenched in multiple allied and partner nation defense industries \u2014 creating a reliable series of revenue streams as they further embed themselves in national security infrastructure.\n\nPalantir leveraged SpaceX\u2019s Starlink platform in the past and may still use the service today to support global security support operations. Likewise, Musk and Palantir CEO Alex Karp are both at the fore of emerging regulatory and safety focus on artificial alignment, with Palantir being one of the top (overlooked) artificial intelligence stocks in today\u2019s market and Musk increasingly vocal regarding perceived dangers surrounding current commercial leader OpenAI.\n\nLikewise, though Trump hasn\u2019t before (to my knowledge) spoken openly about Palantir or its leadership, founder Peter Thiel helped fund his past presidential bids (though he says he doesn\u2019t plan to do so moving forward). Still, Palantir is a strong play in today\u2019s market capturing ongoing geopolitical action alongside continued emphasis on commercial and government artificial intelligence integrations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy and Forget for 30X Returns by 2030",
        "content": "In a balanced portfolio, blue-chip stocks provide steady returns with the comfort of a low beta. On the other hand, growth stocks create big wealth. Today\u2019s blue-chip companies started their journey as promising growth stocks and became millionaires on the way. This column focuses on growth stocks to buy and hold until the end of the decade for multibagger returns.\n\nI have said in the past and will emphasize again that identifying a potential value creator is not a big challenge. The real challenge is to buy and hold through the thick and thin. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) listed in 2009 at a market valuation of $1.5 billion. The journey to current valuation of $550 billion has been through phases of deep corrections and extreme bearish views. If business developments are positive, cutting out the noise and holding with patience makes sense.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about seven growth stocks to buy and hold for massive value creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), an iGaming and online sports betting (OSB) company, is a potential millionaire-maker. The gaming company has a big addressable market and ample headroom for growth in the coming years.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the iGaming and OSB market in the U.S. is expected to swell from $20 billion in 2023 to $30 billion by 2028. This is just for existing states, and as more states legalize gaming, the market size will swell. I also expect DraftKings to expand beyond the U.S. in the coming years. The European online sports betting market is expected to swell to $55.5 billion by 2032.\n\nWhile DraftKings was growing at a stellar pace, profitability was a concern. This concern has been addressed, and the gaming company expects to deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $500 million for the year. Further, EBITDA is expected to swell to $1.4 billion in 2026 and $2.1 billion by 2028. With healthy revenue growth and profitability, DKNG stock will likely be a massive value creator.\n\nEHang Holdings (EH) An image of a lifesize white and black pilotable drone display in China with a man taking a picture of a woman in front of it.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nThe flying car industry is at a nascent stage, but estimates point to sustained growth in the next few decades. Therefore, some of the early movers can create immense value if their business execution is in the right direction. To put things into perspective, the flying car market is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2040. EHang Holdings (NASDAQ:EH) is among the most promising eVTOL stocks to buy and hold.\n\nEHang has already commercialized eVTOL in China. Further, the flying car company received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China for mass production of EH216-S pilotless eVTOL aircraft. This sets the stage for scaling up operations in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother important point to note is that EHang is making aggressive efforts toward international expansion. The company has already completed its first passenger-carrying demo flight in the UAE. Some other markets where demo flights have been conducted include Spain, Costa Rica and Japan. Therefore, I expect orders for the company\u2019s eVTOL to swell, translating into stellar growth.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe EV industry is facing headwinds in the near term, such as slow GDP growth, intense competition and relatively slow adoption of EVs. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, and it\u2019s a good time to accumulate potential value creators.\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) will likely be among the major industry players by the end of the decade. With LI stock trading at a forward P/E of 16.7, it\u2019s the best time to accumulate.\n\nI like that Li Auto has not gone overboard in terms of expansion. The EV company continues to focus on China exclusively, delivering good results. As of May, Li had retail stores, and growth will be supported as the network continues to expand.\n\nA cash buffer of $13.7 billion will support aggressive network expansion and investment in product development. Another reason to like Li is the company\u2019s continued efforts to remain ahead of the technological curve. The company is targeting the launch of level 3 self-driving technology by 2025.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIndia will likely be among the fastest growing countries in the world over the next decade. Several interesting sectors can create massive value. With a rising middle class, India\u2019s travel and tourism sector is expected to boom. Estimates suggest that Indian travellers\u2019 total expenditure will surge to $410 billion by 2030. This will position India as the fourth-largest travel market.\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), an online travel booking company, is, therefore, an interest bet for multibagger returns. With the industry recovering after the pandemic, MMYT stock has surged by 175% in the last 12 months. I would look at corrections to accumulate with a long-term investment horizon.\n\nIn terms of fundamentals, MakeMyTrip achieved the highest ever gross annual booking for the financial year 2024. Revenue growth will likely remain healthy. At the same time, there has been a significant improvement at the operating level. In FY21, the travel booking company reported an operating loss of $18 million. For FY24, operating profit was $124.2 million. Margin expansion will likely sustain on the back of operating leverage.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has been consolidating around $70,000 levels. This is a good opportunity to accumulate quality crypto stocks before the next big move. Among Bitcoin miners, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) looks massively undervalued at a forward P/E of 16.5. With ambitious growth plans and strong fundamentals, RIOT stock is worth considering.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Riot\u2019s balance sheet was zero-debt. The Bitcoin miner reported a cash buffer (including digital assets) of $1.3 billion. Therefore, Riot has high financial flexibility for aggressive expansion.\n\nRecently, Riot proposed to acquireBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) at $2.3 per share. While the proposal was rejected, Riot is clearly looking at acquisitions to establish itself as the largest Bitcoin miner.\n\nRegarding organic growth, Riot ended Q1 with a hash rate capacity of 12.4EH/s. The company is targeting to boost capacity to 31.4EH/s by the end of the year. Further, the long-term target is to achieve a capacity of 100EH/s by 2027. Therefore, revenue and EBITDA growth will likely be robust in the coming years.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nAfter a big rally in the first half of 2021, Pinterest\u2019s (NYSE:PINS) stock was corrected sharply. The key reasons were tight monetary policies and lower growth estimates in a post-pandemic world. However, PINS stock has been revived, with an upside of 81% in the last 12 months. The proxy e-commerce player remains attractively valued and has the potential for significant upside in the long term.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Pinterest reported revenue growth of 23% on a year-on-year basis to $740 million. Further, global active users increased by 12% to 518 million. The company reported operating cash flow of $356 million, which implies an annualized OCF of $1.5 billion. This is a key reason for being bullish on PINS stock, and I expect cash flows to swell further.\n\nTo elaborate on the reason, Pinterest reported a global average revenue per user of $1.46 for Q1 2024. In the U.S. and Canada, the ARPU was $6.05. However, the ARPU was $0.86 and $0.11 for Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. I see ample scope for ARPU upside from emerging markets in the next five years. Even with a stable user base, this will translate into a cash flow upside.\n\nCronos (CRON) CRON stock: Glass jars filled with medicinal cannabis\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s end the discussion on growth stocks to buy and hold with a penny stock with immense potential. Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) stock is possibly the best way to bet on the cannabis sector growth.\n\nI like that Cronos has gone slow in expansion and preserved cash. The cannabis company ended Q1 2024 with a solid cash buffer of $855 million. With regulatory headwinds gradually declining, Cronos is among the best positioned companies from a financial perspective to go aggressive, including organic and possible acquisition-driven growth initiatives.\n\nOn the organic growth front, Cronos has a strong presence in Canada and Israel. In the last few quarters, the company has entered new geographies, including Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom. This is likely to support accelerated revenue growth.\n\nCronos will likely enter the United States with the impending reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule III drug. Additionally, there is a big addressable market for medicinal cannabis in multiple European countries. Also, the company\u2019s entry into Germany comes at the right time with cannabis legalization.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bulls Push Wall Street To Record Highs On Declining Inflation; Tech, Real Estate, Small Caps Surge Ahead Of Fed Meeting: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nA lower-than-expected inflation report for May ignited a bullish frenzy on Wall Street, with investors increasing their bets on rate cuts, bolstered by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will ease its policy stance later this year as price pressures trend towards the 2% target.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items.\n\nThis report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.\n\nThe implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.\n\nIn response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4% to over 19,400 points, setting new record highs. The S&P 500 Index increased by 1.1% to surpass 5,400 points, also achieving fresh all-time highs.\n\nBlue-chip stocks saw a modest rise of 0.2%, but the standout performance came from small caps. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) surged 2.7%, marking its best session since mid-December 2023.\n\nTreasury yields plummeted across the board, with the 2-year yield dropping 15 basis points to 4.68%. Long-dated yields also declined by approximately 10 basis points, propelling the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) up by 1.6%, its strongest one-day performance since early February 2024.\n\nIndustries sensitive to interest rates saw significant gains. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB) and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) soared 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nPrecious metals also rallied on the back of lower yields and a weakening dollar, with gold rising 0.8% and silver surging 2.8%.\n\nCryptocurrencies experienced sharp rallies driven by the risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped 3.6% to $69,800, while the more speculative Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) surged over 8% on the day.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,072.95 2.6% Nasdaq 100 19,471.20 1.4% S&P 500 5,435.07 1.1% Dow Jones 38,819.58 0.2%\n\nUpdated at 12:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 1.1% higher to $542.76. The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA)\u00a0was 0.2% higher to $388.81. The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA: QQQ) was 1.4 higher to $474.65. Sector-wise, the\u00a0TechnologySelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK)\u00a0outperformed, up by 2.6%, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) lagged, down 0.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 4.7%, surpassing Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) as the world\u2019s biggest company. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied over 4%, following Cathie Wood\u2019s bullish projection on the EV maker. The top performers among real estate stocks were Zillow Group Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), eXp World Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPI) and Redfin Corp. (NASDAQ:RDFN), with gains of 13.7%, 11% and 9.4%, respectively. Among the subset of stocks exposed to the office and commercial real estate sector, SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) and Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) rose 8.3% and 8%, respectively. Within the regional bank industry, First Foundation Inc. (NYSE:FFWM) and Western Alliance Bancorp. (NYSE:WAL) rose the most, up 7.5% and 7%, respectively. Caseys General Stores Inc.

        "content": "Even as the S&P 500 reaches new highs, some investors view small-cap value stocks as the best option for long-term growth. Concerns are growing about the concentration of investments in index-based stocks. For instance, S&P 500 investors increasingly depend on mega-cap companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to drive higher benchmarks. This reliance is a double-edged sword; a few missteps by these companies could significantly impact an entire portfolio.\n\nIn contrast, small-cap value stocks offer two key advantages: they are small and agile enough to adapt to changing conditions, providing long-term growth potential, and their value characteristics help preserve capital. This often translates to solid income and dividend opportunities.\n\nThese small-cap value stocks combine these strengths, making them one of the best strategies to diversify risk away from the few dominant stocks controlling your portfolio\u2019s performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApartment Income REIT (AIRC) Small-Cap Stocks. most undervalued small-cap stocks to buy in April\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHigher interest rates typically dampen the new mortgage market while pushing rents upward due to inflation. These trends highlight the resilience of Apartment Income REIT (NYSE:AIRC), a small-cap value stock, in a high-interest-rate environment.\n\nOver the past decade, Apartment Income optimized its multifamily building portfolio, focusing on premium properties in urban areas with strong demographic growth. This strategic emphasis has resulted in consistently high occupancy rates and regular rent increases. Future demand for Apartment Income\u2019s properties will likely come from job and income growth, declining homeownership rates and the continued appeal of city living \u2014 factors amplified by rising interest rates.\n\nApartment Income meticulously refined its portfolio and operational strategy in recent years, reducing its property holdings from 300 in 2008 to 75 today while maintaining a strong presence in key markets. This shift reflects savvy management decisions, prioritizing quality and operational efficiency in preferred locales over mere expansion. Management bolstered its growth potential by moving away from lower-growth areas and ensured resilience against interest rate fluctuations.\n\nWith a 4.65% dividend yield, Apartment Income offers a strong diversification option among small-cap value stocks, demonstrating strength even amid economic uncertainty.\n\nPerimeter Solutions (PRM)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPerimeter Solutions (NYSE:PRM) is a small-cap value stock specializing in firefighting equipment, notably fire suppression and extinguishment chemicals. Since 2010, Perimeter has demonstrated substantial growth, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%. Management projects its revenue will rise to $100.2 billion by 2027 from $70.8 billion in 2022, driven by steady demand for firefighting equipment, underscoring the company\u2019s robust outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerimeter aims to deliver \u201cprivate equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market,\u201d a target it consistently achieves. With a price-to-earnings ratio below 12x, Perimeter appears undervalued despite its recent success. In line with this, management has initiated an aggressive buyback program to enhance shareholder value, resulting in an 11.24% total yield in 2023 and a 7.2% total yield over the preceding 12 months. This buyback program and significant expansion opportunities have propelled shares more than 60% year-to-date. However, there is still time to invest in this promising small-cap value stock.\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nH&R Block (NYSE:HRB) stands out as a unique fintech-esque choice among small-cap value stocks, especially during tax season, though its successes extend throughout the year. To counter the seasonal nature of its tax business, management introduced Spruce, a mobile banking service that has quickly gained traction. In its recent earnings report, H&R Block attributed $41 million of its quarterly revenue to this financial service, complementing its $1.5 billion million in tax preparation sales. Additionally, HRB is leveraging technology to enhance the tax filing experience by developing an AI-powered tax assistance tool in collaboration with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nHRB boasts an impressive total yield of 10.94%, setting it apart from other small-cap value stocks. This high yield is backed by a conservative payout ratio of 29%, demonstrating HRB\u2019s strategy of balancing shareholder rewards with reinvestment into growth opportunities. Though tax season is over, H&R Block incentivized filers to sign up for Spruce in exchange for early tax refund deposits. Because of this, expect Spruce\u2019s recurring revenue to be a major cash cow for H&R Block for the remainder of 2024.\n\nSteelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteelcase (NYSE:SCS), a high-end home office and corporate furniture manufacturer, is a small-cap stock combining stability and significant upside potential. The company has effectively navigated the post-pandemic shift towards work-from-home trends and continues to innovate in response to economic challenges.\n\nSteelcase quickly regained financial stability after pandemic-related setbacks. Its latest annual earnings report showed a net income of $81.1 million, more than double the previous year\u2019s figure. Additionally, the company has maintained steady sales of around $3.2 billion over the past two years, demonstrating its ability to improve margins without compromising quality.\n\nIn response to the ongoing shift toward remote work, Steelcase aims for 5-7% annual sales growth and a 5% free cash flow margin as a percentage of revenue over the next five years. Furthermore, the company has significantly reduced its debt to better manage the higher interest rate environment, enhance liquidity and lower interest costs. These strategic moves position Steelcase as a top small-cap value stock in today\u2019s market.\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX) Photo of steel blue electric car being charged with wind silos and blue sky in the background. EV\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Alexander Steamaze\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) offers significant advantages as a small-cap value stock. It trades at just 6.8x earnings and below 0.5x sales yet remains an underappreciated player in the green tech and sustainable driving sector. The company produces automotive parts that enhance emission reductions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nWhile \u201cpure\u201d EV companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are falling out of favor due to declining consumer interest, evidenced by the rise in hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales, Garrett Motion presents a unique opportunity. It acts as a bridge for investors committed to long-term sustainability but recognizes that global EV adoption is still a distant goal.\n\nGarrett Motion\u2019s recent stock dip followed an earnings report showing a 6% decrease in quarterly sales. However, its annual sales remained stable, and the company maintained healthy margins and free cash flow. This stock is undervalued and often overlooked as investors pursue more prominent growth opportunities. Nonetheless, as automakers adjust their EV planning timelines, Garrett Motion is poised to become a major player in the small-cap value stock market.\n\nMedifast (MED) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedifast (NYSE:MED) has not joined the broader weight loss trend, which has impacted many pharmaceutical stocks. However, this doesn\u2019t diminish the long-term potential for the nutrition and weight loss company to expand its product offerings across various platforms, including multi-level marketing.\n\nMedifast posted a solid $0.76 earnings per share in its first-quarter earnings report. Additionally, the company maintains a robust balance sheet with a $150 million cash reserve and no debt, a significant advantage in today\u2019s high-interest-rate environment. The company\u2019s executives strive to differentiate themselves from larger weight loss competitors.\n\nMedifast is pursuing a more comprehensive and holistic approach to customer management, focusing on guided habit development and personalized coaching. Management has indicated that \u201c2024 will be a year of investment for future growth.\u201d While this may impact its current 15% dividend yield, it does not undermine the company\u2019s long-term growth potential.\n\nCricut (CRCT) A photo of someone using a Cricut machine.\n\nSource: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com\n\nCrafty enthusiasts and DIY creatives adore Cricut (NASDAQ:CRCT), but the small-cap value stock often doesn\u2019t receive the investor attention it deserves. Despite a slight revenue decline in its most recent earnings report, the company still offers investors a 1.83% trailing yield. Cricut is poised to benefit from improving consumer sentiment, especially as buyers seek cost-effective stay-at-home activities to manage household budgets better.\n\nOverall sales fell by 8% in the first quarter of 2024, though increased paid subscribers and higher machine sales partially offset this. This indicates that more people have started their Cricut journey recently, suggesting a future sales boost as these new users purchase and replenish crafting supplies.\n\nNow is an opportune time to invest in Cricut. The company\u2019s management announced a special one-time dividend of $0.40 in the latest earnings report. As of July 2nd, Shareholders of record will receive this significant distribution on July 19th, so there\u2019s still time to get involved.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Musk's Dire Prediction: Civilization Rapidly Drifting Towards a Dystopian or Utopian Future\n\nElon Musk, the unpredictable multibillionaire behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), X (formerly Twitter), The Boring Company, Neuralink, xAI, and SpaceX, often shares his thoughts on the future of humanity on X. Recently, he tweeted, \"Civilization Is Careening Towards Dystopia/Utopia.\"\n\nCivilization is careening towards dystopia/utopia\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2024\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here\u2019s how anyone can invest with $100. A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cubanand opens a round for regular investors at $250.\n\nThis warning is just one of his many tweets discussing the potential collapse of civilization. For instance, he has also repeatedly said, \"The woke mind virus is killing Western civilization,\" and \"If civilization fails, nothing else matters.\" He often warns that human civilization could eventually disappear if birthrates keep dropping. Notably, Musk has fathered 11 children with three different women.\n\nOne of Musk\u2019s main worries is that our civilization could be headed for a bleak future without major changes. He believes the answer lies in making humanity interplanetary, especially through his company, SpaceX.\n\nTrending: Executives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share.\n\nMusk argues, \"If we do not become interplanetary and go beyond our solar system, destruction of all life on Earth is a certainty. It could be as little as half a billion years; that\u2019s only 10% longer than Earth has been around at all. If life had taken 10% longer to evolve on Earth, it wouldn\u2019t exist at all.\"\n\nMars Ambitions\n\nMusk\u2019s vision for Mars is a big part of his plan to save humanity. He thinks building a colony on Mars is vital for our future. He\u2019s creating advanced rockets and technology through SpaceX to make this happen. His team is also working on ways to grow food, generate power, and recycle water and air on Mars to support life there.\n\nHis bold plan involves setting up a city on Mars where people can live, and SpaceX\u2019s Starship, a fully reusable spacecraft, is designed to carry many people and lots of cargo to Mars, although some doubt its abilities.\n\nMusk imagines fleets of these Starships transporting settlers and materials to build this Martian city. That\u2019s why SpaceX is working on Starfactory, a new manufacturing facility in South Texas. The goal is to produce one new Starship rocket daily, which Musk believes will help humanity explore and settle on other planets.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nGM-backed lithium startup launches at $9 per share, aims to revolutionize the energy storage market. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Musk's Dire Prediction: Civilization Rapidly Drifting Towards a Dystopian or Utopian Future originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Elon Musk\u2019s big week gets even more hectic with EU tariff decision and sexual impropriety report",
        "content": "Even by Elon Musk\u2019s standards, this is turning out to be an extraordinary week for news about the notorious headline hound.\n\nTomorrow, of course, is the day when Tesla\u2019s shareholders will have their say on Musk\u2019s absurdly girthy pay package, which would be worth somewhere north of $50 billion (the value fluctuates, as it\u2019s composed of Tesla shares). Plenty has already been said about that, so let\u2019s just wait for the result, but in the meantime do read my colleague Peter Vanham\u2019s article on Tesla\u2019s invocation of \u201cstockholder democracy\u201d in defense of the package.\n\nWhatever the outcome of tomorrow, Tesla and its shareholders have another issue on their hands: The European Union just announced new, provisional tariffs of up to 38.1% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, to counter what the European Commission calls \u201cunfair subsidization\u201d by Beijing.\n\nThis is a problem for Tesla because, while the company has a gigafactory just outside Berlin that churns out its Model Y cars for the European market, the Model 3s that it sells in Europe are made in Shanghai. So, as of July 4, shipments of Tesla\u2019s cheapest model to Europe will become subject to a new tariff of 21%, on top of the 10% levy that is already applied to imported EVs\u2014though it won\u2019t have to actually pay up until November when the Commission finalizes the tariffs (Tesla has requested and may receive \u201can individually calculated duty rate\u201d at this point, the Commission said).\n\nWhatever Tesla ends up having to pay, this will make it harder to compete against the likes of Volkswagen in the European market.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Musk has recently taken to railing against the idea of Western tariffs on Chinese EVs. As recently as January, he was calling for trade barriers against such cars, but last month he declared that \u201cthings that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good.\u201d (The context there was the Biden administration\u2019s decision to levy 100% import duties on China-made EVs, which didn\u2019t have much of a direct effect on Tesla as the company makes its U.S. cars in the U.S.)\n\nMoving away from Tesla, the Wall Street Journal has an explosive and deeply reported piece out about Musk\u2019s conduct at SpaceX, where multiple female employees have said that Musk \u201cshowed them an unusual amount of attention or pursued them.\u201d\n\nOne case had already been publicly reported\u2014that of a SpaceX flight attendant who alleged that Musk exposed himself to her and made an indecent proposal. However, the Journal now reports that another employee said, while leaving the company in 2013, that Musk had asked her to bear his children. (Musk has also had twins with Shivon Zilis, an executive at his Neuralink brain-implant company.)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe report also states that he had sexual relationships with two women at SpaceX: an engineering intern, and a direct report. SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told the Journal that its article contained \u201cuntruths, mischaracterizations, and revisionist history,\u201d but unnamed former SpaceX executives said Musk was able to act with impunity within the company.\n\nFar less seriously, but still somewhat embarrassingly, Musk has abruptly dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, in which he accused them of abandoning OpenAI\u2019s founding agreement and charter by no longer publishing details of its models, nor making them open-source. While these were valid criticisms\u2014the company, which Musk cofounded alongside Altman, was named OpenAI for a reason\u2014that didn\u2019t mean Musk had much of a legal case. The Guardianreports that his lawyers gave no reason for dropping the suit.\n\nAnd speaking of transparency, Musk has also decided that X users will by default no longer show the world which posts they\u2019ve liked. \u201cImportant to allow people to like posts without getting attacked for doing so!\u201d the poly-CEO, who has taken flak for repeatedlyliking the posts of far-right extremists, tweeted.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Europe wants affordable electric vehicles from China. But not at the cost of its own auto industry",
        "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 The European Union moved Wednesday to hike tariffs, or import taxes, on electric vehicles made in China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and the Asian nation's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned tariffs:\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nThe European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, said the preliminary results of its ongoing investigation into Chinese EV subsidies show that the country's battery electric vehicle \u201cvalue chain\u201d benefits from \"unfair subsidization\" that hurts EU rivals. It plans to impose provisional tariffs of up to 38.1% on electric vehicles shipped from China. That's on top of the 10% duties for all imported EVs.\n\nThe commission took aim at three of the biggest Chinese EV players in Europe, saying it would impose extra duties of 17.4% on electric cars from BYD, 20% on those from Geely and 38.1% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC.\n\nGeely owns a stable of popular brands, including Polestar, British sports car maker Lotus and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands.\n\nOther EV manufacturers in China would be subject to duties of at least 21%.\n\nThe commission said it has reached out to Chinese authorities to \"explore possible ways to resolve the issues\" but if those discussions don't result in an effective solution, the duties will take effect on July 4.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nThe value of battery-powered cars imported to Europe skyrocketed from $1.6 billion in 2020 to $11.5 billion last year, according to research firm Rhodium Group. Most of the imports are from Western automakers with factories in China, including Tesla and BMW.\n\nBut EU officials complain Chinese's homegrown automakers are gobbling up market share by undercutting European car brands on price thanks to Beijing\u2019s massive subsidies.\n\nEU officials fear unfairly subsidized imports will hurt Europe's manufacturers and the continent's green tech industries. European countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers. The commission didn't single out Western auto brands, but mentioned that Tesla might get an \u201cindividually calculated\u201d rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25% The U.S. currently imports very few Chinese cars, but like the European Commission, the administration worries that subsidies hurt domestic companies and cost jobs.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports. In contrast, the European Union needs affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve its goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market. BYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.\n\nAs long as a competitive business environment is fair, cheaper Chinese cars benefit consumers and push European carmakers to lower their prices and improve their offerings, according to Niclas Poitiers, a trade expert at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. \u201cThey are very cost-competitive and increase the pressure on other manufacturers that have been dragging their heels,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s the unfair access to subsidies that Europe objects to. \u201cAn EU green policy that would lead to the demise of domestic manufacturers because of unfair competition would not be politically sustainable,\u201d Poitiers said.\n\nHow does China support its electric car industry?\n\nIn China's \u201cmarket socialist\u201d economy, state-owned companies play a leading role. The government also guides and supports privately owned companies to achieve Beijing's economic development goals.\n\nFor EVs, that includes orders for government fleets, low-interest loans from state-owned banks, cheap land for factories from local governments, tax breaks, and subsidized raw materials and parts from state-owned industries.\n\nThe various forms of financial help complicate the EU\u2019s case because it\u2019s difficult to gather data on some of the practices. The EU indicated it selected BYD, Geely and SAIC as a sample to calculate the duties. Other manufacturers in China that cooperated with the investigation but weren't sampled will face extra duties of 21%, while those that didn't cooperate will be hit with the 38.1% rate, the commission said.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nChinese cars are likely to cost more, reducing pressure on European carmakers to keep their prices down. But Chinese companies are able to make cars so cheaply they might still be able to sell at a profit, even with duties as high as 30%.\n\nEuropean carmakers that manufacture electric vehicles in China might wind up as collateral damage. They get some government support in China but less than their Chinese competitors.\n\nFive of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations. Meanwhile a China-made Tesla Model 3 would sell at a loss.\n\nDuties at the 15-30% level could \u201cwipe out the business model for foreign players such as BMW and Tesla, which are using China as a base for exporting to Europe,\u201d the Rhodium Group said in a report.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nChina is almost certain to retaliate and to pressure European officials to negotiate. The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU warned that Beijing could raise duties on cars with engines larger than 2.5 liters, a move that could affect German luxury carmakers such as Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche.\n\nBeijing lashed out after the European Commission unveiled its plans. The higher tariffs are \u201ca naked act of protectionism, creating and escalating trade friction, and \u2018destroying fair competition\u2019 in the name of \u2018safeguarding fair competition,\u2019\" the Commerce Ministry said. It urged the EU to \u201crectify its wrongdoings immediately\u201d and said while China would \u201cresolutely take all necessary measures,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nYet the impact may be smaller than feared, according to analysts at research firm Sanford C. Bernstein.\n\nMercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen now make most of the cars they sell in China at factories there. Only 2% of Volkswagen\u2019s China sales are imports and thus vulnerable to higher tariffs; it\u2019s 15% for BMW and 19% for Mercedes-Benz.\n\nEuropean cars at risk of getting slapped with Chinese tariffs tend to be luxury vehicles that bring juicy profits, like Mercedes' S-Class vehicles and BMW's X6 and X7. However, such cars cater to rich customers who might be inclined to pay higher prices \u201cas long as their purchase behavior is not deemed to be unpatriotic,\u201d the Bernstein analysts noted.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Vita Coco and Xerox have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013June 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares The Vita Coco Company COCO, as the Bull of the Day and Xerox Holdings XRX, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors GM, Ford\u2019s F and Tesla\u2019s TSLA.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nThe Vita Coco Company, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a leading producer of coconut water. The company develops, markets, and distributes coconut water products under the Vita Coco brand in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia Pacific region, as well as the United States.\n\nCoconut water has been all the rage over the past several years, but the fact is this nutritious beverage has been around for centuries. Coconut water is a clear liquid found inside young coconuts that is packed with flavor and electrolytes.\n\nNaturally loaded with potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, you may have noticed some coconut water appears with a pink hue, which is due to higher levels of polyphenols and exposure to sunlight over time.\n\nVita Coco is part of the Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry group, which currently ranks in the top 28% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nStocks within this industry group are also expected to experience above-average earnings growth. Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock\u2019s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.\n\nCompany Description\n\nVita Coco has managed to maintain a substantial market share, commanding over half of the coconut water market in the United States. In addition to coconut water, Vita Coco offers coconut oil and coconut milk; sparkling and purified water; plant-based energy drinks; protein-infused fitness drinks; and a hydration drink mix in powdered form. Vita Coco distributes its products through club, food, retail, drug, mass convenience, e-commerce, and foodservice channels.\n\nThe global coconut water market is projected to be worth nearly $12 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 15.3% over the next several years. As a consumer shift to healthier products continues, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of this theme.\n\nStory continues\n\nVita Coco has also secured partnerships with major beverage companies. For example, the company\u2019s partnership with Diageo led to the launch of Vita Coco Spiked with Captain Morgan, which serves as a prime example of its intent to broaden market reach.\n\nEarnings Trends and Future Estimates\n\nThe producer of coconut water has established an impressive earnings history since its IPO in 2021. The company exceeded earnings estimates in each of the last six quarters. Back in May, Vita Coco posted first-quarter earnings of $0.24/share, a 26.3% surprise over the $0.19/share Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nVita Coco has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 25.3%. Consistently beating earnings estimates is a recipe for success.\n\nAnalysts covering COCO are in agreement and have been raising their earnings estimates lately. For the current fiscal year, analysts increased earnings estimates by 9.47% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $1.04/share, reflecting potential growth of 40.5% relative to the prior year.\n\nLet\u2019s Get Technical\n\nCOCO shares have surged nearly 40% over the past four months. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio \u2013 one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe stock has also been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamental and technical indicators, Vita Coco is poised to continue its outperformance.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Vita Coco has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and COCO continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nVita Coco is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with a best-in-class \u2018A\u2019 rating in our Growth category and a \u2018B\u2019 rating in our Momentum category. This indicates that COCO stock is likely to continue its strong momentum based on a favorable combination of earnings and sales growth.\n\nBacked by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it\u2019s not difficult to see why COCO stock is a compelling investment. An appealing technical trend along with robust fundamentals paint a bullish picture moving forward.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nXerox Holdings, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), operates as a global workplace technology company that integrates hardware, services, and software for enterprises. Xerox designs, develops, and sells document systems, IT software products, and print solutions.\n\nThe company also provides graphic communications, end user computing devices, network infrastructure, commercial robotic process automation, as well as technology product support. Xerox sells its products through its direct sales force, distributors, independent agents, dealers, and e-commerce marketplaces.\n\nXerox continues to grapple with decreased demand for paper-related systems and products due to technological advancements. The presence of a large number of substitutes raises competitive pressure. A vulnerability to security breaches along with an inability to protect intellectual property rights represent major concerns.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nXerox Holdings has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. Shares represent a compelling short or hedge opportunity, even as the major indices eclipse former all-time highs.\n\nXRX stock is part of the Zacks Office Supplies industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 8% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has widely underperformed the market so far in 2024.\n\nWhile individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in weak industry groups, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. Xerox continues to fight an uphill battle and the stock is confirming this notion, lagging the general market by a wide margin.\n\nRecent Earnings and Deteriorating Forecasts\n\nThe print solutions company has missed the earnings mark in two of the past three quarters. Back in April, Xerox posted first-quarter earnings of $0.06/share, missing the $0.38/share consensus estimate by a whopping 84.2%.\n\nXerox has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of 7.8%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance.\n\nAnalysts covering XRX decreased their earnings estimates recently. Looking at the current fiscal year, earnings estimates have been slashed by 7.93% in the past 60 days; the Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $2.09/share. Revenues are projected to decline 6.2% year-over-year to $6.46 billion.\n\nCompanies like Canon, Hewlett-Packard, and Toshiba are capable of giving tough competition to Xerox. These companies are also broadening their product lines and strengthening their global presence, putting a dent in potential growth prospects for Xerox.\n\nTechnical Outlook\n\nXerox\u2019s stock has been steadily falling this year after forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern and has now established a well-defined downtrend.\n\nXRX stock has also experienced the dreaded death cross, whereby its 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Xerox Holdings would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. Shares remain in negative territory this year while the general market has eclipsed its former highs.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that we\u2019re not likely to see this stock print new highs anytime soon. The fact that Xerox is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.\n\nA history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\u2019s downtrend. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of XRX stock until the situation shows major signs of improvement.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nTime to Ride GM Stock for Higher Highs?\n\nGeneral Motors stock printed another day of fresh 52-week highs after the auto giant announced an additional $6 billion in stock buybacks. Continuing to appease investors, this comes as General Motors launched a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program at the end of last year and increased its dividend by 33% going into 2024.\n\nThis is certainly a nod to the confidence General Motors has in its business operations and the ability to generate cash flow but let\u2019s see if it's time to buy GM for more upside.\n\nRecent Performance Overview\n\nEdging towards $50 a share, General Motors' stock has climbed +34% year to date which has largely outperformed Ford\u2019s virtually flat performance and Tesla\u2019s -32% while also topping the broader indexes with the S&P 500 up +6% for the year and the Nasdaq sitting on +15% gains.\n\nNotably, concerns of slower EV sales have been the knock on Tesla\u2019s stock while in contrast GM has thrived on delivering stronger profits thanks to its diverse lineup of EVs and traditional gasoline vehicles. General Motors has also attributed its recent success to its operating discipline with the company\u2019s free cash flow ballooning to almost $30 billion and setting the stage for the recent stock buybacks and dividend hike.\n\nEPS Outlook & P/E Valuation\n\nSpeaking to General Motors' increased profitability, its bottom line expansion is expected to continue with fiscal 2024 earnings now projected to jump 22% to $9.40 per share compared to $7.68 a share last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to rise another 1%.\n\nMore intriguing is that GM still trades at just 5X forward earnings which is even beneath Ford\u2019s 6.2X and the industry average of 12.8X while being well below the S&P 500\u2019s 21.7X and Tesla\u2019s 70.4X.\n\nReinstated Dividend\n\nAfter reinstating its dividend in 2022 following a suspension during the pandemic, General Motors increased its payout from 3 cents per quarter to 12 cents at the beginning of the year.\n\nAlthough General Motors' annual dividend yield of 1.01% is still well below Ford\u2019s 4.85% it has crept closer to the S&P 500\u2019s 1.38% average with it being noteworthy that many auto stocks (including Tesla) don\u2019t offer a payout to shareholders as they are focused on growth.\n\nTakeaway\n\nAfter such an extensive YTD rally, General Motors stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, there could be better buying opportunities ahead but longer-term investors should continue to be rewarded from current levels considering General Motors' increased profitability and cheap P/E valuation.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

XPeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) stock price did not react.\n\nThe tariffs, championed by France and Spain, are projected to generate over $2.15 billion (2 billion euros) annually for the EU budget as Chinese EV sales in Europe grow.\n\nIn 2023, China exported $10.76 billion (10 billion euros) worth of electric cars to the EU, FT noted.\n\nThe Kiel Institute, an economic think tank, suggests that an extra 20% tariff could cut Chinese electric car imports by a quarter, reducing about 125,000 units from the 500,000 vehicles imported in 2023.\n\n2023 Germany alone exported 216,299 cars to China, experiencing a 15% drop from the previous year.\n\nVolvo Car AB (OTC:VLVCY) recently migrated EV production to Belgium to dodge the EU tariffs.\n\nEarlier in May, Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius urged the EU to reduce tariffs on EVs imported from China.\n\nChina is Tesla's biggest market after the U.S. and accounted for 33% of global sales in 2023, CNN cited Rho Motion.\n\nPrice Actions: NIO shares traded lower by 3.14% at $4.32 premarket at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhotos via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report NIO (NIO): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Chinese EV Stocks Nio, Li Auto, XPeng On Wednesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "After a slump throughout 2022 and 2023 \u2014 largely due to tighter monetary policy \u2014 sustainable energy stocks may soon surge again. In-development and installed renewables grew by about 10% to 3,609 gigawatts in 2023 and might serve as a leading indicator that the wider sector is set to boom.\n\nBut which sustainable energy stocks are best to bet on, considering what we know about the sector\u2019s performance? Household solar is a losing proposition for most investors, as the sustainable energy segment\u2019s competition is steep and margins are thin (before getting into ongoing sourcing concerns). Electric vehicle charging stocks face the same problem, and EVs themselves are better valued as either car companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) or a manufacturer-meets-tech powerhouse like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rather than pure-play sustainable energy stocks.\n\nThese three sustainable energy stocks pivot around those pitfalls, with two offering unique (but risky) access to long-term sustainable energy trends, while the third is a stable giant offering private equity-like gains to anchor your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNano Nuclear Energy (NNE) clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in Belgium\n\nSource: engel.ac / Shutterstock\n\nNuclear energy is slowly and quietly undergoing a resurgence, and few sustainable energy stocks are as well-positioned to capture the imminent upside as Nano Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ:NNE).\n\nAt the end of May, the Biden-Harris administration announced a new series of initiatives to boost America\u2019s domestic nuclear energy industry. The initial report points to the fact that nuclear power is (somewhat surprisingly) the nation\u2019s largest clean energy producer, producing nearly 20% of last year\u2019s total national energy. While there are few details about what the administration plans to do moving forward, they formed a Nuclear Power Project Management and Delivery working group to assess, create recommendations, and operationalize new nuclear initiatives.\n\nTo that end, Nano Nuclear Energy is unique among nuclear energy stocks \u2014 let alone sustainable energy stocks \u2014 as the company develops micro-sized, portable reactors to modulate and disperse nuclear energy opportunities more easily. The company\u2019s stock hit public markets in mid-May; since then, shares have surged 33%. Though management doesn\u2019t project full-scale systems deployment until 2030, Nano Nuclear could benefit big-time from the increased focus on nuclear energy as an alternative to other sustainable energy stocks.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to capture a wide-ranging slice of the renewable energy sector \u2014 and private equity-like gains to boot \u2014 few sustainable energy stocks can top Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP). Brookfield Renewable is a management fund that owns a range of global sustainable energy companies across a diverse portfolio that includes wind, solar, and hydroelectric offerings.\n\nBrookfield marked a major win last month after the sustainable energy stock entered a \u201cfirst o -its kind global framework agreement\u201d with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to help the tech giant reach its net-zero goals by 2030. This agreement includes \u201c100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases.\u201d\n\nBrookfield\u2019s financials are also robust and notable among the best sustainable energy stocks, considering the wider sector\u2019s struggles post-ZIRP. The company\u2019s first-quarter report included a 7.6% jump in funds from operations and a dividend distribution aligned with the company\u2019s goal to offer \u201ca sustainable distribution with increases targeted on average at 5% to 9% annually.\u201d Brookfield Renewable\u2019s current dividend yield sits at a respectable 5.1%, which, again, makes it a unique income-producing player compared to most sustainable energy stocks.\n\nStem (STEM) Businessman using ai technology for make money. chat bot with AI Artificial Intelligence generate. Futuristic technology, robot in online system. Business in future to invest and make money concept. AI stocks to buy\n\nSource: MMD Creative / Shutterstock.com\n\nSustainable energy stock Stem (NYSE:STEM) blends two unique \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 sectors: sustainable energy solutions and artificial intelligence. Stem\u2019s Athena software acts as an intermediary or control system between generators, grid power, distributed resources like solar farms, and battery energy storage to best direct resources while accounting for weather, energy pricing and more. That\u2019s all built upon an artificial intelligence backbone that, at the end of the day, creates a self-managing series of sustainable energy solutions for a range of large-scale enterprise customers.\n\nThough trading firmly within penny stock territory, Stem\u2019s leadership has 10X ambitions. The company\u2019s AI and the Future of Energywhite paper points to a well-thought-out strategic plan about how AI integration will accelerate and create efficiencies across sustainable energy markets.\n\nLike so many speculative renewable energy stocks, Stem\u2019s major sticking point is its current lack of profitability. Likewise, the company\u2019s cyclical sales nature adds a bit more variability than most would like. Still, the company is beyond its pre-revenue phase and has a growing portfolio of completed projects. While definitely a long-term, buy-and-hold sustainable energy stock like Nano Nuclear, adding Stem to your portfolio of sustainable energy stocks is a good way to capture emerging AI influence on the sector as it shows its strength within existing green physical infrastructure.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Is NIO Stock a Ticking Time Bomb? Examining the Bear Case.",
        "content": "Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE: NIO)\u00a0is certainly a top option for investors looking for exposure to the high-growth Chinese EV market. The company\u2019s top models are highly popular in China, and the company has seen strong market share gains in the battery EV space in recent years.\n\nWith more than $7 billion in revenue over the past year, the company expects to grow at a 20%+ clip in future years. Indeed, this growth should support higher stock prices over time.\n\nThe company\u2019s deliveries are up more than 50% year-over-year, and from a narrative perspective, this is certainly among the EV stocks seeing significant growth bulls may certainly focus on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, the company is posting significant losses, with last year\u2019s total bottom line EPS number coming in at -$1.70 per share.\n\nWith a stock price that\u2019s now below $5 per share, this is a company that certainly provides a high-risk, high-potential option for investors to consider. The question is whether this decline is likely to continue, or if this stock is worth holding or buying here.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nNio Gets Approval of 3rd Factory in China\n\nNio recently secured approval for a third factory in China, with a potential production capacity of 1 million cars per year. This factor could rival Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ: TSLA) Shanghai gigafactory facility.\n\nTesla\u2019s plant can produce 1.1 million vehicles yearly, making it the largest globally. Thus, this regulatory approval for Nio\u2019s facility marks a significant milestone for the company, despite some ongoing overcapacity concerns.\n\nThe EV company also started construction of its third plant, F3, without disclosing the commencement of mass production. Located in Huainan city, Anhui province, F3 will focus on manufacturing vehicles for Nio\u2019s budget-friendly brand, Onvo.\n\nNio confirmed that construction has already begun on its third plant, with the company aiming for an initial 100,000-unit capacity. The expansion addresses rising demand for Nio and Onvo vehicles, with potential for future growth.\n\nStrong Rival to Tesla\n\nRecently, William Li, Nio\u2019s current CEO, shared his intentions in competing with Tesla\u2019s Model Y units and Toyota\u2019s RAV4. Deliveries and orders continue for the L60, and its expected to start its deliveries on September.\n\nNio\u2019s CEO, William Li, unveiled the vehicle in Shanghai, expressing intentions to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model Y and Toyota\u2019s RAV4. Orders for the L60 have begun, with deliveries set for September. Nio plans to introduce a new Onvo model annually to expand into the family car market and global markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these obstacles, Nio is currently confronted with 100% tariffs in the U.S. and an EU investigation into Chinese EV imports for alleged subsidies. Global electric car manufacturers grapple with declining sales and heightened competition.\n\nTesla started layoffs of over 10% of its EV workforce in April, while reporting a profit decline of over 50% in Q1. Similarly, China\u2019s BYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDF) experienced profit drops due to reduced demand and market price conflicts.\n\nThe NIO Bear Case\n\nNio is emphasizing EV battery-swapping tech this year, evident in its reported partnerships. Nio\u2019s collaborations showcase strategic alliances, but success isn\u2019t guaranteed because of high costs and alternative fast-charging methods. Developing battery-swap technology involves substantial R&D expenses.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also raised tariffs on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%. This has made it harder for Nio to plan out their strategies for the North American market. Nio\u2019s CEO criticized the move as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d but it\u2019s unlikely to prompt policy changes. Similar tariffs from the EU may further hinder Nio\u2019s expansion plans.\n\nBe Cautious With NIO Stock\n\nAs investors are always hyped for EV manufacturers like Nio because of its potential, its stock has been failing to deliver the numbers.\n\nDespite its strong start to the year, NIO stock has seen a double-digit decline this year, which appears to have momentum to the downside. With gross margins deteriorating and geopolitical challenges mounting, the picture is murky for this company, to say the least.\n\nIn 2023, the company lost over $2,000 per unit delivered compared to 2022\u2019s numbers. Monthly deliveries were still below projected numbers despite a great record in May. However, based on these projections, Nio could still incur losses, akin to Tesla\u2019s early years.\n\nMoreover, high debt and profitability concerns suggest a risky investment with uncertain returns. This makes NIO stock a risky bet in my view.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "Investment bank Jefferies hosted a discussion focused on the upcoming Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, where participants, among other things, outlined the potential scenarios that could lead to Elon Musk increasing his ownership in the electric vehicle (EV) giant.\n\nAccording to a legal expert, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO can obtain a stake of as much as 25%.\n\nOne of the key components of this possibility revolves around the ongoing legal case in Delaware regarding Musk's 2018 compensation package. The ruling by Chancellor McCormick (NYSE:MKC), which requires the rescission of the entire package, is still unresolved.\n\n\"The AGM vote will not end matters in Delaware. Chancellor McCormick's ruling that the entire 2018 pay package has to be rescinded is still a live case,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in a note.\n\nThe case is built on four main points: Musk's role as a controlling stockholder despite holding only 12.9% of shares, a compromised compensation committee, misinformation provided to stockholders, and the burden of proof on Tesla to justify the pay package.\n\nTesla and Musk have yet to file an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court. Should Chancellor McCormick issue an order consistent with her initial opinion, Tesla and Musk might argue the significance of the shareholder vote to the Supreme Court, potentially prolonging the resolution by up to a year. In the interim, the options within the company treasury could be used for future employee share-based compensation if not awarded to Musk.\n\nFixing the compensation package would involve a new process with a fully independent compensation committee and would likely include retrospective pay, the legal expert noted.\n\nThey also believe that there is a possibility of Musk bringing a separate lawsuit against Tesla for compensation for services rendered, which could be settled in a simpler manner. However, this settlement, in turn, \u201cwould be open to challenge.\u201d\n\nThe independent compensation committee, following the outlined process, could make a reasonable case for rebuilding Musk's stake, legal expert notes.\n\n\u201cA dual-share class/voting share structure is difficult to implement retrospectively in a public company but could be done, e.g., as part of a recapitalization or acquisition,\u201d they highlighted.\n\n\u201cIt would be considered a 'conflicted transaction' that would itself likely be subject to legal actions from other shareholders.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the relocation of Tesla to Texas is likely to proceed. Texas corporate law, still in its early stages, might facilitate Musk's efforts to rebuild his stake if procedures are designed favorably. While Musk will not vote on compensation, he could influence the vote on relocating to Texas during the annual meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLegal expert explains how Elon Musk can get a 25% stake in Tesla\n\nThousands of Amazon Flex drivers file arbitration claims for misclassification as contractors\n\nOracle surges as annual revenue growth outlook tops estimates amid solid AI demand\n\nView comments",

        "content": "WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Elon Musk made billions of dollars by selling Tesla stock using insider information, an institutional shareholder accused in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, asking the court to direct the Tesla CEO to return \"unlawful profits.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes two days before a critical vote by Tesla shareholders on whether to reinstate Musk's $56 billion pay package, after a Delaware judge voided it in January because she found that Musk had improperly controlled the process.\n\nMusk and his brother, Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director, sold a combined $30 billion in the electric vehicle maker's stock between late 2021 and the end of 2022, cashing in before news that would cause the stock to fall became public, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI).\n\nMusk sold the shares at artificially inflated prices by concealing his plan to use the proceeds to buy social media platform Twitter, which he later renamed X, according to the lawsuit, filed at the Delaware Chancery Court. Musk also sold Tesla stock when he knew that deliveries of Tesla cars had fallen far below public projections, the lawsuit said.\n\nMusk and Tesla did not respond to messages seeking a comment.\n\nThe Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island holds about 140,000 shares of Tesla. Tesla's stock closed at $170.66 on Tuesday, valuing the stake at about $24 million.\n\nA similar suit filed at the same court late last month by Michael Perry, another Tesla shareholder, accused Musk of insider trading when he sold over $7.5 billion of shares in Tesla in late 2022.\n\nMusk is in the middle of a regulatory probe to determine whether he broke federal securities laws in 2022 when he bought Twitter stock.\n\nTuesday's lawsuit by ERSRI also said that Musk had been disloyal toward Tesla in several instances, including diverting Tesla employees to work at X and causing Tesla to start paying for advertising on Twitter after he bought the platform.\n\nERSRI was concerned that Tesla's board of directors was not doing enough to oversee Musk's conflicts of interest, the fund's general treasurer said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware, and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",
