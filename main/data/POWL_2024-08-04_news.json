        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this energy equipment company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Powell Industries is 48.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 191.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 14.8%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Powell Industries is 153.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 10.8%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 55.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Powell Industries. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 32.9% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Powell Industries a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Powell Industries well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) could be a solid choice for investors given the company's remarkably improving earnings outlook. While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.\n\nThe rising trend in estimate revisions, which is a result of growing analyst optimism on the earnings prospects of this energy equipment company, should get reflected in its stock price.

        "title": "Earnings Beat: Powell Industries, Inc. Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Models",
        "content": "A week ago, Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) came out with a strong set of quarterly numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. Statutory revenue of US$288m and earnings of US$3.79 both blasted past expectations, beating expectations by 30% and 75%, respectively, ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analyst has updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analyst is expecting for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Powell Industries  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the single analyst covering Powell Industries are now predicting revenues of US$1.05b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a meaningful 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 15% to US$12.44. In the lead-up to this report, the analyst had been modelling revenues of US$923.6m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.28 in 2025. There has definitely been an improvement in perception after these results, with the analyst noticeably increasing both their earnings and revenue estimates.\n\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analyst has lifted their price target 18% to US$181per share.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analyst, with revenue forecast to display 9.1% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 11% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 8.0% annually. So although Powell Industries is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analyst upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Powell Industries following these results. There was also an upgrade to revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analyst clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At least one analyst has provided forecasts out to 2026, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.\n\nPlus, you should also learn about the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Powell Industries (including 1 which can't be ignored) .\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Does This Valuation Of Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nPowell Industries' estimated fair value is US$106 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$133 suggests Powell Industries is potentially 26% overvalued\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Powell Industries\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$70.8m US$69.5m US$69.1m US$69.4m US$70.0m US$71.0m US$72.2m US$73.6m US$75.1m US$76.7m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Est @ -1.78% Est @ -0.53% Est @ 0.34% Est @ 0.95% Est @ 1.38% Est @ 1.68% Est @ 1.89% Est @ 2.04% Est @ 2.14% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$65.9 US$60.3 US$55.9 US$52.3 US$49.1 US$46.4 US$44.0 US$41.7 US$39.7 US$37.8\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$493m\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$77m\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.4%) = US$1.6b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.6b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$779m\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$1.3b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$133, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Powell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.079. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Powell Industries\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nCurrently debt free.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electrical market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 2 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nNo apparent threats visible for POWL.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.79 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.12 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.52 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 78.77%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this energy equipment company would post earnings of $1.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of 45.50%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nPowell Industries , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, posted revenues of $288.17 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.57%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $192.37 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPowell Industries shares have added about 55.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Powell Industries?\n\nWhile Powell Industries has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Powell Industries: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.19 on $221.62 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.04 on $888.12 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Electronics is currently in the top 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Energous (WATT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024.\n\nThis maker of wire-free charging technology is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nEnergous' revenues are expected to be $0.14 million, up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Powell Industries Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results",
        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc.\n\nHOUSTON, July 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: POWL), a leading supplier of custom-engineered solutions for the management, control and distribution of electrical energy, today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 ended June 30, 2024. All comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThird Quarter Key Financial Highlights:\n\nRevenues totaled $288 million, an increase of 50%; Gross profit of $82 million, or 28.4% of revenue; Net income of $46 million, or $3.79 per diluted share; New orders(1) totaled $356 million, spread broadly across our key end markets; Backlog(2) as of June 30, 2024 remained at $1.3 billion; Cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2024 totaled $374 million.\n\nBrett A. Cope, Powell\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \u201cPowell\u2019s fiscal third quarter results reflect strong execution across Powell and further validates our strategy as well as our unique market position as an integrator of complex, engineered-to-order electrical solutions. Revenues in the quarter were 50% higher than the prior period, driven by strength across nearly all of the market sectors we serve. We booked $356 million of new orders in the quarter, which were spread broadly across our key end markets. Importantly, the most significant increase was driven by our Electric Utility sector, while we were also awarded a notable Petrochemical order in the quarter. Overall, I am very pleased to report solid operational performance in the quarter coupled with broad and robust customer activity across our markets.\u201d\n\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results\n\nRevenues totaled $288.2 million, an increase of 50% compared to $192.4 million in the prior period, and an increase of 13% compared to $255.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase compared to the prior period was primarily driven by strong growth in the Oil and Gas sector, which grew by 56% to $114.3 million, as well as by the Petrochemical sector, which grew 158% to $56.8 million. Revenues from the Electric Utility sector totaled $57.0 million, an increase of 30%, while revenues within the Commercial and Other Industrial sector increased 18% to $42.0 million.\n\nGross profit increased 92% to $81.7 million, or 28.4% of revenue, compared to $42.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in the prior period and compared to $62.7 million, or 24.6% of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross margin was driven by the higher volume levels across all of Powell\u2019s manufacturing facilities generating favorable volume leverage, strong project execution, and continuing efforts to improve factory efficiencies while also managing product pricing that corresponds to current cost levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew orders totaled $356 million compared to $505 million in the prior period and compared to $235 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year decline was the result of two greenfield LNG projects on the Gulf Coast that combined for roughly $200 million that were awarded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nBacklog totaled $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2024, which was essentially unchanged when compared to backlog as of March 31, 2024, as well as backlog as of June 30, 2023.\n\nNet income was $46.2 million, or $3.79 per diluted share, compared to $18.5 million, or $1.52 per diluted share in the prior period and compared to $33.5 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nCope added, \u201cWe remain very confident in the composition of our current backlog, the near- and medium-term outlook for our key end markets as well as our strong financial position. We have increased our investments to create incremental capacity, which includes both recently completed and newly announced facility expansions. In the beginning of July, we acquired nine acres of property near our Houston headquarters location to help further facilitate the execution of our current backlog as well as planning for modest volume growth looking forward. Altogether, we continue to expect a favorable operating environment for Powell as we focus on successfully delivering the projects in backlog to our customers and advancing our strategy.\u201d\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nCommenting on the Company's outlook, Michael Metcalf, Powell\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, said, \u201cLooking forward, we remain encouraged with where Powell is positioned as we enter the last quarter of fiscal 2024. Commercial activity remains strong, providing a tailwind as we close out the year and prepare for fiscal 2025. Operationally, we continue to make improvements necessary to execute our backlog, while also progressing our plans to thoughtfully expand our capabilities. Notwithstanding the typical challenges associated with a projects-based business, based upon the quality of our backlog and our liquidity position, we believe that we are well-positioned to sustain our year-to-date financial performance through the fourth quarter, while providing a strong entry point as we look forward to fiscal 2025.\u201d\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nPowell Industries has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, July 31, 2024 at 11:00\u00a0a.m. Eastern time.

        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc. POWL is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended June 2024) results on Jul 30, before market open.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.12 per share, which has been unchanged in the past 60 days. The consensus mark implies growth of 39.5% from the year-ago actual. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $217.4 million, suggesting a 13% increase from the year-ago actual.\n\nPOWL's Estimate Movement Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPOWL has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing three quarters, the average beat being 66.9%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 45.5%.\n\nThe electrical equipment manufacturer\u2019s strong performance can be largely attributed to its strong foothold and improving conditions in its oil and gas and petrochemical markets. A solid pipeline of projects within the LNG market and its growing presence across the data center and electric utility sectors, along with a solid backlog, have been key catalysts behind the company\u2019s growth.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Powell this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Powell has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at $2.12. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: POWL presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nPowell Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Powell Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPowell Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Powell Industries, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors Shaping Quarterly Performance\n\nHealthy levels of project activity and a strong backlog level are likely to have enhanced Powell\u2019s fiscal third-quarter performance. Exiting the fiscal second quarter (ended March 2024), POWL\u2019s backlog level totaled $1.3 billion, out of which a solid volume of orders consisted of small and medium-sized awards.\r\n\r\nThe company has been witnessing several favorable trends across its oil, gas and petrochemical end markets that include growth in energy transition projects, such as biofuels, carbon capture and hydrogen. Also, significant project awards, supported by high investments in LNG, related gas processing and petrochemical processes, are likely to have driven its fiscal third-quarter revenues.\r\n\r\nHigher demand for electrical power from data centers in the United States has also been driving the demand for POWL\u2019s products and solutions. Powell is strengthening its participation across the electrical power value chain and benefiting from momentum in data center and utility end markets. A strong booking in electric utility and commercial markets is likely to have augmented its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nPowell is expected to have benefited from its capacity expansion initiatives, particularly at the electrical products factory in Houston. The expansionary efforts have been enabling the company to better serve its customers with enhanced offerings across data centers, hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture and other transitional energy markets. This is expected to get reflected in POWL\u2019s results for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nGiven strength across its end markets, Powell is anticipated to have put up a healthy margin performance, supported by its focus on project execution, operational efficiencies and pricing actions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company has been witnessing escalating costs of sales and operating expenses, which are likely to have weighed on its bottom-line performance. Also, the company has been witnessing supply-chain constraints for specifically engineered components, which are anticipated to have inflated costs and delayed the delivery of products to its customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nPowell\u2019s shares have exhibited an uptrend in the past year, leaving behind its peers and the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry. POWL shares have skyrocketed 129.1%, outperforming the industry\u2019s and the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 20.3% and 19%, respectively. The company\u2019s peers Schneider Electric S.E. SBGSY and EnerSys ENS have gained 34.3% and 1.4%, respectively, in the same period.\n\nPOWL Outperforms Industry, S&P 500 & Peers Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWith a forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 15.08X, which is below the industry average of 24.34X, the stock presents a potentially attractive valuation for investors. Also, the stock is trading below many of its peers, such as Franklin Electric Co., Inc. FELE and Schneider Electric.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings (Forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nWith a comprehensive and diversified product portfolio, Powell has been capitalizing on the growing opportunities in oil and gas, and petrochemical end markets. The company's strong focus on innovation, diversification of its product and customer mix, and expansionary efforts at the Houston facility have improved its growth potential.\r\n\r\nRobust demand in multiple end markets, including data centers, hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture and other transitional energy markets, bodes well for the company ahead of its fiscal third-quarter earnings.

        "content": "Investors interested in Manufacturing - Electronics stocks are likely familiar with Powell Industries (POWL) and Kone Oyj Unsponsored ADR (KNYJY). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nRight now, both Powell Industries and Kone Oyj Unsponsored ADR are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nPOWL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.60, while KNYJY has a forward P/E of 22.35. We also note that POWL has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. KNYJY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.61.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for POWL is its P/B ratio of 4.29. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, KNYJY has a P/B of 11.66.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help POWL earn a Value grade of A, while KNYJY has been given a Value grade of C.\n\nBoth POWL and KNYJY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that POWL is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should Value Investors Buy Powell Industries (POWL) Stock?",
        "content": "Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\n\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.\n\nIn addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.\n\nOne stock to keep an eye on is Powell Industries (POWL). POWL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 15.29, while its industry has an average P/E of 25.50. POWL's Forward P/E has been as high as 24.80 and as low as 14.47, with a median of 17.86, all within the past year.\n\nPOWL is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.09. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. POWL's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.20. Within the past year, POWL's PEG has been as high as 1.77 and as low as 1.03, with a median of 1.28.\n\nAnother valuation metric that we should highlight is POWL's P/B ratio of 4.19. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 4.29. Over the past year, POWL's P/B has been as high as 6.28 and as low as 2.19, with a median of 3.13.\n\nValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. POWL has a P/S ratio of 1.99. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.\n\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Powell Industries is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, POWL feels like a great value stock at the moment.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investors interested in Industrial Products stocks should always be looking to find the best-performing companies in the group. Has EnerSys (ENS) been one of those stocks this year? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nEnerSys is one of 218 individual stocks in the Industrial Products sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #8 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. EnerSys is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nOver the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENS' full-year earnings has moved 3.9% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\n\nBased on the latest available data, ENS has gained about 9.1% so far this year. At the same time, Industrial Products stocks have gained an average of 7.9%. This means that EnerSys is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) is another Industrial Products stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has returned 59.6%.\n\nThe consensus estimate for Powell Industries' current year EPS has increased 19.9% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nLooking more specifically, EnerSys belongs to the Manufacturing - Electronics industry, a group that includes 16 individual stocks and currently sits at #23 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have gained about 16.5% so far this year, so ENS is slightly underperforming its industry this group in terms of year-to-date returns. Powell Industries is also part of the same industry.\n\nGoing forward, investors interested in Industrial Products stocks should continue to pay close attention to EnerSys and Powell Industries as they could maintain their solid performance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.78%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 1.29%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.7%.\n\nThe the stock of energy equipment company has fallen by 19.4% in the past month, lagging the Industrial Products sector's gain of 4.21% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.14%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Powell Industries in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 30, 2024. On that day, Powell Industries is projected to report earnings of $2.12 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 39.47%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $217.37 million, indicating a 13% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.04 per share and a revenue of $888.12 million, signifying shifts of +119.42% and +27%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Powell Industries. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "content": "Ever since NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) broke $1,000 I\u2019ve been telling my readers that it is going to be the first company to achieve a market cap of $5 trillion.\n\n(I also said last August that NVIDIA would be a $1,000 stock in 2024 \u2013 and it broke $1,000 less than a year later.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to do so slowly, by quietly meandering higher over the course of a half-decade or more.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInstead, I think it\u2019s going to so in a series of sharp, fast moves up. And it\u2019s going to reach that $5 trillion mark in just a couple of years.\n\nI call these big, fast moves \u201cFlash Trends.\u201d And NVIDIA seems to be \u201crecovering\u201d \u2013 taking a breather \u2013 after its latest Flash Trend.\n\nConsider this: Its latest Flash Trend got started after the company announced stunning first-quarter earnings on May 22. The AI chip maker revealed that revenues grew 262% year-over-year to $26 billion, while earnings per share rose 460% year-over-year to $0.61. Both figures beat Wall Street expectations by wide margins.\n\nShares surged 20% in the wake of the better-than-expected results\u2026 and then rallied nearly 50% less than a month later. That\u2019s fast\u2026 and big.\n\nAlong the way, NVIDIA briefly dethroned Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to become the world\u2019s most valuable company, with its market cap exceeding $3.3 trillion.\n\nMy Accelerated Profits members have benefited hugely from NVIDIA\u2019s Flash Trends over the past year. They\u2019re up more than 150% on the position we established in January of this year.\n\nSo today, let\u2019s take a look at what exactly these Flash Trends are\u2026 and how you can learn how to identify them early in order to rack up the kinds of profits that can build you a nice nest egg.\n\nFrom Big and Stable to Bigger and Chaotic\n\nFor the past few decades, you could invest in a big, stable company and reliably see it grow 8% to 10% per year. That\u2019s the way investing is supposed to work. But that\u2019s not how it does anymore.\n\nThe reality is that over the past few years, our financial system has been distorted, causing our markets to undergo a massive shift. You see, our market isn\u2019t static. It\u2019s always changing and evolving. We\u2019ve entered a whole new era, in which a lot of the gains in the market are concentrated in just a few stocks.\n\nThis has crowded out many of the other big-name companies investors have relied on for years, causing them to trend down or outright collapse.\n\nInstead, the real gains \u2013 and the \u201cnew way\u201d of investing \u2013 are coming in big, quick bursts. As a result, investing as we know it is dead.\n\nStocks are no longer climbing steadily like they have for decades. Instead, their gains are appearing in short, quick moves\u2026\n\nStory continues\n\nWhich I like to call \u201cFlash Trends.\u201d\n\nBut the problem is most folks can\u2019t anticipate these Flash Trends, so they\u2019re now stuck in stocks either going sideways or even tanking. Or, if they do get lucky enough to get into a stock that experiences a Flash Trend, they won\u2019t time it right\u2026 and end up in a stock that\u2019s already experienced its biggest gains.\n\nThanks to my proprietary quantitative stock-picking system, I\u2019ve found a way to catch Flash Trends before they occur.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works\u2026\n\nAbout four years ago, when I noticed this big change in the markets, I set out to find the answer to one question: Which combination of factors represent the best precursors that tell us a massive amount of money is about to flow into a stock\u2026 that a massive Flash Trend is coming?\n\nAfter countless hours of research and crunching trillions of data points, I discovered that eight \u201cprecursors\u201d \u2013 including positive earnings revisions and sales growth \u2013 that indicate a Flash Trend is on its way in the very near term:\n\nA precursor is a sign that an event is likely to happen in the future. Many events in life are often preceded by precursors. For example, family history and high cholesterol can be precursors to heart disease. In a less distressing example, the smell of ozone and pets acting weird can be precursors to a thunderstorm.\n\nSuch precursors can also clue us into the likelihood of Flash Trends.\n\nAnother Case in Point\n\nWhile not as flashy as NVIDIA \u2013 not much is \u2013 let\u2019s consider Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL), for example.\n\nPowell started as a local metalworking shop in Houston in 1947. But over the next 75 years, Powell\u2019s operations expanded globally to better meet rising demand.\n\nToday, Powell focuses on the development and manufacture of equipment and systems for electrical infrastructure, which are used by not only petrochemical plants but also pulp and paper mills, oil and gas producers, utilities and transportation facilities.\n\nI recommended the stock on December 11, 2023, to members of my elite service Accelerated Profits. Since then, it has soared 45% \u2013 well above the S&P 500\u2019s 21% advance, the Dow\u2019s 13% gain and the NASDAQ\u2019s 25% climb.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2026 I didn\u2019t have any inside information \u2013 and I didn\u2019t need any luck. My recommendation was based solely on my quantitative system telling me that a Flash Trend was building inside the stock.\n\nSeven of my eight precursors had lined up, which signaled that it was time to buy. And as you can in the chart below, the stock took off shortly after my recommendation.\n\nAnd then in January of this year, POWL soared more than 50% on its blowout quarterly report, so I told my Accelerated Profits subscribers take partial gains. Those who had invested $7,500 when I first recommended POWL in December 2023 would\u2019ve claimed about a $3,330 on their initial investment in less than three months.\n\nMy quantitative system has also led to quick wins like\u2026\n\nA 52% gain in Teekay Tankers Ltd. (TNK) in about six months. A 147% gain in GasLog Partners LP (GLOP) in just over a year. And a 102% gain in Ardmore Shipping Corporation (ASC) in only six months.\n\nJust to name a few.\n\nThe bottom line: If you can anticipate these Flash Trends, it\u2019s possible to make incredible returns in very short periods of time.\n\nTo learn more about Flash Trends, watch my Flash Trend Event briefing here. In this briefing, I tell you everything you need to know about my quantitative system\u2026 those eight precursors\u2026 and more.\n\nI also share where you can find the four stocks my system targeted that are set to experience Flash Trends.

        "title": "Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this energy equipment company have returned -14.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, which Powell Industries falls in, has gained 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Powell Industries is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +119.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Powell Industries is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for POWL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate of $217.37 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13%. The $888.12 million and $923.65 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27% and +4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $255.11 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.8%. EPS of $2.75 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205.73 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24%. The EPS surprise was +45.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's Why We Think Powell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) Is Well Worth Watching",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Powell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Powell Industries\n\nPowell Industries' Improving Profits\n\nStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. Commendations have to be given in seeing that Powell Industries grew its EPS from US$2.32 to US$8.55, in one short year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Powell Industries shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 3.8% to 14%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Powell Industries' future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Powell Industries Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that Powell Industries insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$369m. Coming in at 22% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Powell Industries, with market caps between US$1.0b and US$3.2b, is around US$5.6m.\n\nThe Powell Industries CEO received US$2.9m in compensation for the year ending September 2023. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.\n\nShould You Add Powell Industries To Your Watchlist?\n\nPowell Industries' earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. Powell Industries is certainly doing some things right and is well worth investigating. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Powell Industries has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nAlthough Powell Industries certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

        "title": "Powell Industries (POWL) Up 70.4% YTD: What's Next for Investors?",
        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc. POWL shares have surged 70.4% year to date, outpacing the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry and the Industrial Products sector, which have returned 15% and 2.5%, respectively. Closing at $150.65 in the last trading session, the stock is trading below its 52-week high of $209.14 but significantly higher than its 52-week low of $58.30.\r\n\r\nThe electrical equipment manufacturer\u2019s impressive performance can be largely attributed to its strong foothold and improving conditions in two key markets, which are oil and gas and petrochemical.\r\n\r\nA strong pipeline of projects within the LNG market and its growing presence across the data center and electric utility sectors, along with a solid backlog, are key catalysts behind the company\u2019s growth. Its diversification efforts beyond its core oil, gas and petrochemical markets have enhanced its market share across the utility, commercial and other industrial markets. Courtesy of strength across its business, POWL has outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 16.7% in the year-to-date period.\n\nPrice Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors Driving the Stock\n\nPowell\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended March 2024) results indicated strong year-over-year growth, with revenues growing 49% to $255 million, driven by continued strength and healthy levels of project activity across its end markets. New orders totaled $235 million, reflecting strong growth in bookings that led to a backlog of $1.3 billion exiting the fiscal second quarter. Importantly, the $235 million of orders consisted of a solid volume of small and medium-sized awards that reflected the company\u2019s core competencies and well-balanced portfolio across markets.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s revenues in the quarter were primarily driven by the strong performance of its largest markets, oil & gas and petrochemical, which grew 66% and 93%, respectively. POWL is witnessing several favorable trends in oil & gas and petrochemical markets that hold promise for its long-term growth.\r\n\r\nThis includes growth in energy transition projects, such as biofuels, carbon capture and hydrogen. Significant project awards supported by high investments in LNG, related gas processing and petrochemical processes have set POWL apart as a leading supplier of critical electrical infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIncreasing demand for electrical power from data centers is also creating a new opportunity for growth for this company. Powell is strengthening its participation across the electrical power value chain and benefiting from momentum in data center and utility end markets. Notably, it witnessed strong bookings in electric utility and commercial markets in the first six months of fiscal 2024 in the United States and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for POWL\u2019s fiscal 2024 (ending September 2024) revenues is pegged at $888.1 million, indicating 27% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $9.04, which has remained stable in the past 60 days, indicating 119.4% growth year over year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBetter-Than-Industry Returns\n\nPOWL\u2019s trailing 12-month return on assets (\u201cROE\u201d) is indicative of its growth potential. ROE for the trailing 12 months is 27.93%, much higher than the industry\u2019s 9.87%, reflecting the company\u2019s efficient usage of shareholders\u2019 funds. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nReturn on assets is 12.96%, ahead of the industry\u2019s 5.55%, indicating that the company has been utilizing its assets efficiently to generate returns. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStock Valuation\n\nWith a forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 16.74X, which is well below the industry average of 24.70X, the stock presents a potentially attractive valuation for investors. Also, the stock is cheap compared with many of its peers like Eaton Corporation ETN and Schneider Electric S.E. SBGSY, which are overvalued compared with the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Ails the Stock?\n\nDespite the positives, Powell has been coping with the adverse impacts of the high cost of sales and operating expenses. For instance, in the first six months of fiscal 2024, its cost of sales climbed 37.8% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.7%. Cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, were 75% for the period. Also, the company continues to witness supply-chain constraints for specifically engineered components, which might inflate costs and delay the delivery of products to its customers.\r\n\r\nStiff competition from major players like Franklin Electric Co., Inc. FELE could hamper the company\u2019s ability to maintain its market share. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds, such as underlying inflation and higher interest rates, might create a challenging backdrop.\r\n\r\nApart from this, POWL is currently trading below its 50-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the promising long-term prospects and strong return on equity, maintaining a position in Powell, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), appears prudent at present. This stance reflects confidence in Powell's growth trajectory and its potential to deliver sustained value to investors over time.

        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) closed the latest trading day at $153.95, indicating a -1.92% change from the previous session's end. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.16% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.04%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.18%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the energy equipment company had lost 15.03% over the past month. This has lagged the Industrial Products sector's loss of 5.09% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Powell Industries in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $2.12, showcasing a 39.47% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $217.37 million, indicating a 13% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $9.04 per share and a revenue of $888.12 million, indicating changes of +119.42% and +27%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Powell Industries should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, Powell Industries boasts a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Powell Industries is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.36. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.61, so one might conclude that Powell Industries is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that POWL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Manufacturing - Electronics was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.9 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Manufacturing - Electronics industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 17, placing it within the top 7% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investors interested in Manufacturing - Electronics stocks are likely familiar with Powell Industries (POWL) and Eaton (ETN). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, Powell Industries is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Eaton has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). This means that POWL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPOWL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.36, while ETN has a forward P/E of 30.61. We also note that POWL has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.70.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for POWL is its P/B ratio of 4.78. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ETN has a P/B of 6.69.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help POWL earn a Value grade of B, while ETN has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nPOWL has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ETN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that POWL is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this energy equipment company have returned -15%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, which Powell Industries falls in, has lost 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Powell Industries is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.04 points to a change of +119.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Powell Industries is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for POWL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate of $217.37 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13%. The $888.12 million and $923.65 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +27% and +4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $255.11 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.8%. EPS of $2.75 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205.73 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24%. The EPS surprise was +45.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this energy equipment company have returned -5.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, to which Powell Industries belongs, has lost 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPowell Industries is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.04 points to a change of +119.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Powell Industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for POWL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $217.37 million indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $888.12 million and $923.65 million estimates indicate +27% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $255.11 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.8%. EPS of $2.75 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205.73 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24%. The EPS surprise was +45.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A. O. Smith Corporation AOS has been benefiting from strong demand for water heater products and higher shipments in North America. The company expects sales from both the North America boiler and water treatment businesses to grow approximately 8-10% in 2024. Also, healthy demand for tankless water heaters and kitchen appliance products in China has been boosting performance of the Rest of the World business. For 2024, A. O. Smith expects overall sales to increase approximately 3-5% from the year-ago levels.\r\n\r\nThe company remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. In the first quarter of 2024, AOS acquired a California-based water treatment company, Impact Water Products. The buyout is expected to expand its water treatment business in the West Coast region. Also, the acquisition of Atlantic Filter in June 2022, enhanced its position in the water treatment industry, and strengthened its customer base in Florida and the adjacent regions. The company spent $21.1 million on acquisitions in the first three months of 2024.\r\n\r\nManagement is committed to rewarding shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases. In the first three months of 2024, it paid dividends worth $47.3 million and repurchased shares worth $74.5 million. In October 2023, it hiked its dividend by 7% to 32 cents per share.\r\n\r\nAlso, AOS\u2019 sound liquidity position adds to its strength. Exiting the first quarter of 2024, it had cash and cash equivalents of $251.6 million, higher than the total debt of $119.7 million. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOver the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 18.2% compared with the industry\u2019s 33.8% growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, weakened consumer confidence and a challenged real estate market in China may prove detrimental for A. O. Smith in the quarters ahead. The company lowered its 2024 third-party sales growth outlook for China. It currently expects the metric to be flat to up 3% in local currency.\r\n\r\nThe escalating cost of sales poses a threat to A. O. Smith\u2019s bottom line. In the first quarter of 2024, the company\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8.4% year over year. The metric, as a percentage of sales, increased 80 basis points in the quarter. In the second quarter, commodity cost, specifically of steel, is expected to increase 20% sequentially, which might affect its margins and profitability.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are presented below.\r\n\r\nPowell Industries, Inc.

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Eaton Corporation, Zurn Elkay Water Solutions, AZZ and Powell Industries",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Eaton Corporation plc ETN, Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corp. ZWS, AZZ Inc. AZZ and Powell Industries, Inc. POWL.\n\nIndustry: Electronics Manufacturing\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2283112/4-electronics-stocks-poised-to-gain-on-prospering-industry-trends\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry is poised for growth on the back of improving supply-chain conditions. Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, strength across prominent end markets should help the industry stay afloat.\n\nThe growing adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes bodes well for the industry participants. A surge in e-commerce activities is also likely to foster growth of the industry. Eaton Corporation plc, Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corp., AZZ Inc. and Powell Industries, Inc. are a few industry participants that might capitalize on the prevalent opportunities.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems.\n\nThese companies offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users. The firms are increasing investments in developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience and supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.\n\nMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Electronics Industry\n\nWeakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector is denting demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management report, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager's Index) touched 48.7% in May 2024, reflecting a decline from 49.2% recorded in April. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity.\n\nAlso, the New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory at 45.4% in May, declining 3.7 percentage points from the figure recorded in April. The months of April and May registered a slowdown in orders compared with the beginning of the year, with weaker-than-expected readings on manufacturing and construction spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnd-Market Strength & Technological Advancements: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. Electronics manufacturers have been gaining from higher adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes by original equipment manufacturers.\n\nThe requirement for integrating advanced electronic components into machinery and electronic devices has supported the electronics manufacturing services market. With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, several industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. Digitization is enabling industry participants to boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management.\n\nEasing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, primarily related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report's Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the third consecutive month in May. Easing supply-chain issues should support manufacturing electronics companies' growth in 2024. An anticipated reduction in raw material costs should aid the bottom line of manufacturing electronics companies. A surge in the e-commerce business also bodes well.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #23. This rank places it in the top 9% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are keeping more faith in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for the current year have increased 3.5% in the past year.\n\nGiven the upbeat near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks for your consideration. But it is worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector & the S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry has outperformed both the broader sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite index in the past year.\n\nOver this period, the industry has rallied 45.6% compared with the sector's and S&P 500 Index's growth of 23.7% and 23.4%, respectively.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 26.06X compared with the S&P 500's 20.90X. It is also above the sector's P/E ratio of 18.20X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.43X, as low as 14.73X and at the median of 22.16X.\n\n4 Manufacturing - Electronics Stocks to Buy\n\nAZZ: Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, the company is engaged in providing metal coating services, welding solutions and specialty electrical equipment to a wide range of markets, primarily in North America. Higher volumes for hot-dip galvanizing within the renewables, utility, OEM, and construction markets should continue to boost the company's top line. The company's pricing actions and operational improvement initiatives have also been proving beneficial. AZZ sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShares of AZZ have skyrocketed 123.5% in the past year. The company reported better-than-expected results in each of the last three quarters, the average being 36%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2025 (ending February 2025) earnings has been revised upward by 5% in the past 60 days.\n\nPowell Industries: Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company is engaged in designing, manufacturing, and distributing custom-engineered equipment and systems. Strength across petrochemical, oil and gas, utility, commercial and other industrial end markets, along with a solid backlog, is a key catalyst behind this company's growth. A strong pipeline of projects within the LNG market and higher activities related to energy transition projects are likely to drive its performance.\n\nShares of Powell Industries have soared 181.3% in the past year. The company reported better-than-expected results in each of the last three quarters, the average being 66.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zacks Rank #1 company's fiscal 2024 (ending September 2024) earnings has been revised upward by 19.9% in the past 60 days.\n\nEaton: Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, this is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems. ETN is benefiting from improving end market conditions, increasing demand from the new AI data center, solid backlog level and product development initiatives through investments in research and development.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's shares have rallied 76.7% in a year. The company reported better-than-expected results in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 2.7% in the past 60 days.\n\nZurn Elkay Water Solutions: Based in Milwaukee, WI, the company is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of water management solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. ZWS is poised to gain from growing awareness of the need for clean, filtered drinking water, solid demand for its products and solutions and its focus on operational execution.\n\nShares of Zurn Elkay Water Solutions have jumped 27.3% in a year. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 10.3%, on average, beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 company's 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 2.6% in the past 60 days.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Will Weakness in Powell Industries, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:POWL) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "With its stock down 15% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Powell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Powell Industries'  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Powell Industries\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Powell Industries is:\n\n26% = US$102m \u00f7 US$394m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.26 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Powell Industries' Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Powell Industries has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Powell Industries' exceptional 52% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Powell Industries' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 16%. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Powell Industries fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Powell Industries Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nPowell Industries' three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 45%, meaning the company retains 55% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Powell Industries is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.\n\nAdditionally, Powell Industries has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Powell Industries' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "title": "POWL vs. ETN: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?",
        "content": "Investors with an interest in Manufacturing - Electronics stocks have likely encountered both Powell Industries (POWL) and Eaton (ETN). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Powell Industries has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Eaton has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that POWL is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPOWL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.95, while ETN has a forward P/E of 30.73. We also note that POWL has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.71.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for POWL is its P/B ratio of 5.22. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ETN has a P/B of 6.71.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help POWL earn a Value grade of B, while ETN has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nPOWL stands above ETN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that POWL is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, the New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory at 45.4% in May, declining 3.7 percentage points from the figure recorded in April. The months of April and May registered a slowdown in orders compared with the beginning of the year, with weaker-than-expected readings on manufacturing and construction spending.\r\n\r\nEnd-Market Strength & Technological Advancements: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. Electronics manufacturers have been gaining from higher adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes by original equipment manufacturers. The requirement for integrating advanced electronic components into machinery and electronic devices has supported the electronics manufacturing services market. With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, several industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. Digitization is enabling industry participants to boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management.\r\n\r\nEasing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, primarily related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report\u2019s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the third consecutive month in May. Easing supply-chain issues should support manufacturing electronics companies\u2019 growth in 2024. An anticipated reduction in raw material costs should aid the bottom line of manufacturing electronics companies. A surge in the e-commerce business also bodes well.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #23. This rank places it in the top 9% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are keeping more faith in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry\u2019s earnings estimates for the current year have increased 3.5% in the past year.\r\n\r\nGiven the upbeat near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks for your consideration. But it is worth looking at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector & the S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry has outperformed both the broader sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite index in the past year.\r\n\r\nOver this period, the industry has rallied 45.6% compared with the sector\u2019s and S&P 500 Index\u2019s growth of 23.7% and 23.4%, respectively.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 26.06X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.90X.

        "title": "5 Top-Ranked Stocks Powering Nasdaq's Rally to the 17,000 Mark",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite Index hit a series of record highs and closed above the 17,000 milestone for the first time ever. Solid corporate earnings, artificial intelligence (AI) boom and rate cut bets have been driving stocks higher. In particular, NVIDIA\u2019s blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism in the stock market along with the global artificial intelligence boom. This drove Nasdaq further up. The tech-heavy index has risen 13.4% so far this year.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the stocks have performed well this year, we have highlighted five of them that more than doubled this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These are Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, Vital Farms Inc. VITL, Powell Industries Inc. POWL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and AppLovin Corporation APP. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its AI-enabled GPU chips. The AI chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share.\r\n\r\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth in the tech sector and beyond. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\r\n\r\nHowever, concerns over stubborn inflation once again might halt the rally in the Index. This is because the Fed minutes and upbeat manufacturing data, both of which highlight concerns over stubborn inflation, have again pushed back the timing of rate cuts.\r\n\r\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, it failed to show further progress toward the Fed\u2019s 2% objective in recent months, per its latest minutes. As such, the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought. Meanwhile, U.S. business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth led by an upturn in the service sector. The data indicates that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. The strength in the economy could spark a revival in inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nSuper Micro designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. The stock has skyrocketed 208% so far this year.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro saw a positive earnings estimate revision of $1.34 for the fiscal year ending June 2024 and has an earnings growth rate of 99.1%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and a solid Momentum Score of B.\r\n\r\nVital Farms offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods. Its products include shell eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs, ghee and liquid whole eggs. The stock has soared 157.5% year to date. It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 17 cents over the past 30 days for this year, with an estimated earnings growth rate of 59.3%.\r\n\r\nVital Farms has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nPowell Industries designs, develops, manufactures, sells and services custom-engineered equipment and systems. The stock has soared nearly 133% so far this year. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.50 over the past 30 days for the fiscal year ending September 2024, with an estimated earnings growth rate of 119.4%.\r\n\r\nPowell Industries has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU.

It has climbed 109% year to date.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this energy equipment company have returned +34.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, which Powell Industries falls in, has gained 4.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Powell Industries is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.04 points to a change of +119.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +19.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Powell Industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for POWL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $217.37 million indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $888.12 million and $923.65 million estimates indicate +27% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $255.11 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.8%. EPS of $2.75 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205.73 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24%. The EPS surprise was +45.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's Why You Should Retain EnerSys (ENS) in Your Portfolio Now",
        "content": "EnerSys ENS has been witnessing solid momentum in its Motive Power segment, supported by strong orders for its products in electric industrial forklift trucks market. The segment\u2019s revenues increased 3% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 2024). The global megatrends including 5G expansion, rural broadband build-outs, electrification, automation and decarbonization are expected to support the company\u2019s growth in the quarters ahead.\r\n\r\nEnerSys intends to strengthen and expand its businesses through buyouts. In April 2023, it acquired U.K.-based battery service and maintenance provider, Industrial Battery and Charger Services Limited (IBCS). The inclusion of IBCS enhanced its foothold in the U.K. market. Also, in May 2024, it inked a deal to acquire Bren-Tronics in an all-cash deal of $208 million. The acquisition should boost ENS\u2019 position as a critical enabler of energy transition and support its growth in the growing military and defense end market.\r\n\r\nENS remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. For instance, it paid out dividends of $34.5 million and repurchased shares worth $95.7 million in fiscal 2024. Its quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 29% in August 2023. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOver the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's shares have risen 18.4% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 9.1%.\r\n\r\nHowever, EnerSys has been witnessing persistent weakness in the Energy Systems segment due to lower capital spending of the telecommunication and broadband customers. The segment\u2019s revenues decreased 19.4% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Lower demand in the network communications, and telecom and broadband markets remains a concern.\r\n\r\nGiven its substantial international operations, foreign currency woes might also hurt its top line in the quarters ahead. For instance, in the fiscal fourth quarter, foreign currency translation had an adverse impact of 1% on sales.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are presented below.\r\n\r\nPowell Industries, Inc.

        "title": "Powell Industries (POWL) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this energy equipment company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Powell Industries is 48.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 119.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.7%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Powell Industries is 153.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 10.8%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 55.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Powell Industries. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 19.9% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPowell Industries has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Powell Industries well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this energy equipment company have returned +35.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, which Powell Industries falls in, has gained 5.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Powell Industries is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.04 points to a change of +119.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +19.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Powell Industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for POWL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $217.37 million indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $888.12 million and $923.65 million estimates indicate +27% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $255.11 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.8%. EPS of $2.75 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205.73 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24%. The EPS surprise was +45.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Electrifying Electrical Equipment Stocks to Supercharge Your Portfolio",
        "content": "We\u2019re going to need a great deal of new electricity in order to provide power for all of the AI tools. In March, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk stated that the U.S. would suffer electricity outages in 2025 because of the power consumption of AI. Meanwhile, many electric utilities have said that more power plants will be needed. This is leading investors to begin to look at which electrical equipment stocks they should buy.\n\nFor example, Sempra (NYSE:SRE), which supplies power in California and Texas, is sounding the alarm about the datacenters which are being built. It says that in order to support AI there is the need for thousands of megawatts of additional electricity. And, a great deal of equipment will have to be purchased in order to run the new power plants. Consequently, the top and bottom-lines of companies that sell electrical equipment are likely to grow very quickly in the coming years. Here are three of the top electrical equipment stocks to buy.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) stock has slumped recently after threats of a potential executive order from former President Donald Trump. He has said he plans to issue an executive order curtailing wind power if he becomes president again. The company is a major supplier of wind turbines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, if he makes it back into the White House, the most Trump could do is prevent wind projects from being deployed on public land and stop auctioning off portions of U.S. coastal waters for wind projects. However, many big data center owners such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are pledging to rely on renewable energy for their electricity needs. This means the demand for wind power in the U.S. is going to expand tremendously no matter what happens in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, GE Vernova also generates a great deal of its revenue from selling and servicing natural gas turbines. Last month Goldman Sachs reported that Natural gas is expected to supply 60% of the power demand growth from AI and data centers. Finally, GEV supplies many other types of electrical equipment, such as transformers and circuit breakers.\n\nGiven its exposure to multiple, strong portions of the electrical equipment sector, GE Vernova is one of the best electrical equipment stocks to buy.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) Solar panels and wind turbines are part of Kensho Clean Power ETF (CRGN) clean energy holdings\n\nSource: sezer66 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPowell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) sells various types of customized electrical equipment. In other words, the firm designs equipment in order to meet the needs of its individual customers in various industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn April 30, POWL reported superb financial results for Q2 2024. During the period, its revenue jumped 49% year-over-year to $255 million. Meanwhile, its new orders soared 19% versus the end of Q4 2023 to $235 million. Moreover, the firm\u2019s gross margin increased by over 5% in Q1 2024 to 24.6%. And, its net income came in at $33.5 million, up from $8.5 million in Q1 2023.\n\nPowell\u2019s CFO Michael Metcalf has said that the company\u2019s core end markets are exhibiting favorable dynamics and activity levels to support our growth.\n\nEaton Corporation (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nEaton (NYSE:ETN) sells electrical components. This includes items such as wiring devices, circuit protection products and utility power distribution products. As of the end of 2023, billionaire Ken Griffin owned 1.26 million shares of ETN stock. Further, he increased his holdings of the name by 70% in Q4 of 2023.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Eaton\u2019s revenue advanced 8%, excluding acquisitions and divestments, year-over-year. And its operating cash flow climbed 42% YOY to $475 million. Plus, its electrical business is really taking off as the unit\u2019s backlog increased 27% YOY.\n\nAlso importantly, Eaton raised its 2024 EPS guidance, excluding certain items, to $10.20-$10.60, versus its previous outlook of $9.95-$10.35. If the company\u2019s EPS comes in at the midpoint of the range, its EPS will jump 14% this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in GEV.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Manufacturing - Electronics stocks have likely encountered both Powell Industries (POWL) and Eaton (ETN). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, Powell Industries is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Eaton has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that POWL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ETN has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPOWL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.61, while ETN has a forward P/E of 31.58. We also note that POWL has a PEG ratio of 1.33. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.61.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for POWL is its P/B ratio of 5.12. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ETN has a P/B of 6.84.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to POWL's Value grade of B and ETN's Value grade of D.\n\nPOWL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that POWL is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Powell Industries (POWL) Is Up 7.48% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Powell Industries (POWL), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Powell Industries currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if POWL is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this energy equipment company holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor POWL, shares are up 7.48% over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry is up 0.45% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 19.42% compares favorably with the industry's 0.95% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Powell Industries have risen 6.78%, and are up 205.03% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.22% and 27.15%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to POWL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. POWL is currently averaging 330,757 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with POWL.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost POWL's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.54 to $9.04 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that POWL is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Powell Industries on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

THC.\n\n5 Strong Picks to Ride the Wave of Relative Price Strength\n\nHistorically, April has been a favorable month for Wall Street investors. However, this year, the month concluded on a disappointing note. Persistent inflation, a resilient job market and a significant drop in U.S. GDP growth eroded confidence in risky assets like stocks. Consequently, the S&P 500 Index plunged 4.2% in April, ending a five-month winning streak.\n\nYet, U.S. stock markets are likely to bounce back in May, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's clear statement rejecting interest rate hikes in the post-FOMC meeting. Investors also welcomed better-than-anticipated first-quarter 2024 earnings results.\n\nGiven the circumstances, it's wise for investors to focus on stocks with a strong relative price performance. This strategy allows them to capitalize on promising opportunities with the potential for high returns.\n\nRelative Price Strength Strategy\n\nWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.\n\nUpon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.\n\nHowever, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures a winning option on your hands.\n\nThen again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.\n\nFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter\u2019s (Q1) earnings to our screen.

        "title": "Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this energy equipment company have returned +15.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, to which Powell Industries belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Powell Industries is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share, indicating a change of +39.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +17.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.04 points to a change of +119.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +19.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.99 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Powell Industries is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for POWL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $217.37 million indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $888.12 million and $923.65 million estimates indicate +27% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $255.11 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48.8%. EPS of $2.75 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205.73 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +24%. The EPS surprise was +45.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Strong Picks to Ride the Wave of  Relative Price Strength",
        "content": "Historically, April has been a favorable month for Wall Street investors. However, this year, the month concluded on a disappointing note. Persistent inflation, a resilient job market and a significant drop in U.S. GDP growth eroded confidence in risky assets like stocks. Consequently, the S&P 500 Index plunged 4.2% in April, ending a five-month winning streak.\n\nYet, U.S. stock markets are likely to bounce back in May, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's clear statement rejecting interest rate hikes in the post-FOMC meeting. Investors also welcomed better-than-anticipated first-quarter 2024 earnings results.\n\nGiven the circumstances, it's wise for investors to focus on stocks with a strong relative price performance. This strategy allows them to capitalize on promising opportunities with the potential for high returns.\n\nRelative Price Strength Strategy\n\nWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.\n\nUpon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.\n\nHowever, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures a winning option on your hands.\n\nThen again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength.

        "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Powell Industries (POWL)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this energy equipment company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Powell Industries is 53.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 119.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.7%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Powell Industries is 153.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 10.8%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 55.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Powell Industries. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 19.9% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Powell Industries a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Powell Industries is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Powell Industries (POWL) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Powell Industries basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Powell Industries, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Powell Industries\n\nThis energy equipment company is expected to earn $9.04 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 119.4%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Powell Industries. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 19.9%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Powell Industries to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Results: Powell Industries, Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",
        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) just released its latest second-quarter results and things are looking bullish. Statutory earnings performance was extremely strong, with revenue of US$255m beating expectations by 27% and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.75, an impressive 55%ahead of expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Powell Industries after the latest results.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Powell Industries  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Powell Industries' two analysts is for revenues of US$903.1m in 2024. This would reflect a modest 6.2% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 7.4% to US$9.20. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$841.8m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.69 in 2024. So it seems there's been a definite increase in optimism about Powell Industries' future following the latest results, with a decent improvement in the earnings per share forecasts in particular.\n\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 13% to US$145per share.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Powell Industries' past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's clear from the latest estimates that Powell Industries' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 13% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 8.0% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 7.7% annually. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Powell Industries is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Powell Industries' earnings potential next year. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At least one analyst has provided forecasts out to 2025, which can be seen for free  on our platform here.\n\nBefore you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Powell Industries that we have uncovered.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 1, 2024\n\nPowell Industries, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day, and welcome to the Powell Industries Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Coleman with Investor Relations.

Thank you for joining us today to review Powell's fiscal 2024 second quarter results. I will make a few comments and then turn the call over to Mike for more financial commentary, before we take your questions. Powell's second quarter financial results showed strong year-over-year growth, supported by continued strength and healthy levels of project activity from our core Industrial end markets and complemented by impressive performances from both the Utility and the Commercial and Other Industrial sectors. New orders in the quarter totaled $235 million, reflecting another strong quarter of bookings and in line with our expectations of a normalized but still elevated cadence of awards.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, there were no mega projects included in our second quarter bookings. Rather, the $235 million of orders is comprised of a strong volume of small- and medium-sized awards that speak to our core competencies and well-balanced across our markets. Our revenue in the quarter grew 49% to $255 million, driven mainly by strong performance from our largest markets, Oil and Gas and Petrochemical, which grew 66% and 93%, respectively, compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. As our operations have ramped to meet the demand of higher overall project volumes, we remain focused on project execution and operational efficiencies. Many of the initiatives and process improvements put into place during the lean quarters of the pandemic continue to work well as we are benefiting today from improved and more efficient manufacturing operational processes.\n\nThese streamline operations also helped to create additional capacity while also delivering attractive returns for our stakeholders. Our gross profit was very strong in the quarter, growing 88% versus the same period in the prior year, leading to a gross profit of 24.6% of revenue or 510 basis points better than the prior year. We are also benefiting from the quality of our backlog as it carries a more favorable margin profile than that of recent years. This is mainly driven by a higher share of Industrial projects where Powell's core expertise and competencies lie, and conversely, a more selective share of work, which tends to carry a lower margin profile due to either the nature of how this type of work is awarded or content less favorable to our strength of handling complex heavier engineering requirements.\n\nWhile we are, of course, always conscientious of how we utilize our resources to pursue and quote projects, Powell's focus on custom engineered-to-order solutions for complex projects means that we rarely aspire to win projects on price. Rather, the value we provide is our industry-leading track record for both our product technology and our project expertise, and that we deliver for our customers on every project. The strength of our engineering teams is equally important as it enables us to be closer to the customer throughout the project life cycle, allowing us to adapt quickly as project requirements, scope and timing change, while fostering healthy long-term customer relationships. On the bottom line, we recorded net income of $33.5 million or $2.75 per diluted share, which was roughly 4 times higher than the $8.5 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the year-ago period.\n\nOur backlog remains near the highest in Powell's history and was roughly flat sequentially at $1.3 billion. Regarding our capacity initiatives. The expansion of our Houston facility on the Gulf Coast is complete, and that expansion is providing us with incremental fabrication and integration support for large power control rooms, especially for projects that support delivery and transport by water access. In addition, the expansion of our electrical products factory in Houston is progressing as planned. This $11 million expansion is expected to be completed in the middle of fiscal 2025 and coincides with our initiative to release new products in support of our future growth across the customers and markets we serve. We remain comfortable with our current staffing levels and are confident that we have the right people in place to meet the demanding project schedules of our backlog.\n\nHowever, as we look out over a multiyear period and evaluate the markets we serve, finding talent and engineers to help us increase our throughput will remain a critical area of focus for us. Our HR team continues to do a terrific job finding great people to join the Powell team, as well as developing creative staffing plans to improve efficiency and help us service a backlog that has tripled in just two years. Looking forward, our expectations for project activity and new orders are relatively unchanged. Overall, quoting activity remains very healthy and balanced. Within the Oil and Gas LNG market, the fundamentals of the U.S. natural gas market remain favorable and support many global economic and environmental goals over a long-term horizon. A circuit breaker installed in a control panel illuminated by bright LEDs.\n\nNatural gas price spreads across global markets remain conducive to U.S. export activity. That said, it is our assessment that the comments earlier this year from the U.S. Department of Energy regarding U.S. LNG export permitting have had a slight dampening effect on new projects coming to market for bid. These projects are likely being pushed out to the right and have not yet impacted Powell's long-term planning for this market. The fundamentals for our Oil and Gas and Petrochemical markets continue to underwrite our expectation for continued strength for these sectors, which also includes energy transition projects, such as biofuels, carbon capture and hydrogen. Activity within our Commercial and Other Industrial markets also remains attractive.\n\nRevenue in this segment grew 57% this quarter. Over the past several quarters, the growth in this sector has been driven by our growing presence in the data center market and has mostly been driven by a limited amount of the total value that we could offer. We believe that the strong growth that we have seen so far in this fast-growing market for Powell has a larger potential as we continue to qualify more of our products and services for the future of this important end market. We have primarily served the outside connection of the data center to the grid and see the potential for further penetration within the 4 walls of the data center where Powell can provide increased value. In addition, sales to data center customers have generally been smaller in scale and focused on individual products.\n\nHowever, as data centers grow in both physical size and computing power, the electrical energy demanded by these facilities will only grow in scale. As a result, the power solutions required by data centers will also grow in sophistication and require companies like Powell to build customized and fully integrated solutions within a single power control room to ensure the reliability and uptime performance of the servers to store and secure the data. We are prepared for this future and are building relationships with both hyperscalers as well as co-locators to better understand the power demands of these facilities to deliver Powell's engineer-to-order solutions for these customers. Lastly, the outlook for our Utility market is among the most positive in recent years.\n\nPowell has grown to become a leading provider of utility distribution substations. These types of projects remain core to our results in this market, but recently, we have seen the return of new-generation work. Helped by the increasing electrical power demands, such as data centers, it is clear that overall power generation capacity across the U.S. must grow in the coming years. We are optimistic that we are beginning to see the initial stages of an increase in utility projects to meet this expected demand. The quality of projects we are seeing in this market remain favorable as does our ability to secure new orders on the projects we pursue. To wrap up, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first half of our fiscal 2024, and our outlook for each of the markets we serve remains favorable.\n\nWe benefit from a strong balance sheet and a $1.3 billion backlog that we believe will sustain our profitability through fiscal 2024 and into 2025. Meanwhile, our near- and medium-term priorities remain unchanged. We are focused on growing our electrical automation platform, expanding our services franchise, and diversifying and expanding our electrical products and solutions portfolio. We remain committed to these initiatives and are pleased with the progress we are making in each of these key areas. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike to walk us through our financial results in greater detail.\n\nMike Metcalf: Thank you, Brett, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we reported total revenue of $255 million compared to $171 million or 49% higher versus the same period in fiscal 2023. New orders booked in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 were $235 million, which was 54% lower than the same period 1 year ago on a difficult comparison as the prior period included 2 mega-project bookings. As we focus on diversifying our project backlog, we continue to experience positive momentum in new bookings across both the Electric Utility sector and the Commercial and Other Industrial sector, which are both higher sequentially by 61% and 3%, respectively. With these end markets contributing to the solid order activity, in addition to the sustained commercial activity in our core Industrial end markets, they combined to generate a 0.9 times book-to-bill ratio in the current quarter, which results in the fiscal second quarter ending backlog at $1.3 billion, $255 million higher versus 1 year ago and $23 million lower sequentially.\n\nCompared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, domestic revenues improved by 62% to $217 million, while international revenues were 2% higher, driven predominantly by increased project volume at our Canadian facility. In total, international revenues were up by $1 million to $38 million in the second fiscal quarter. From a market sector perspective versus the second quarter of fiscal 2023, revenues across our Oil and Gas and Petrochemical sectors continued their positive momentum. The Oil and Gas sector was higher by 66%, while the Petrochemical sector nearly doubled, higher by 93%. In addition to the continued year-over-year growth in these sectors, we also experienced solid growth in both the Electrical Utility and Commercial and Other Industrial market sectors, increasing by 11% and 57%, respectively, reflecting our ongoing focus to grow in tangential markets outside of our core Industrial end market.\n\nThe Light Rail Traction Power sector was lower by 38% as we continue to be very selective in this market sector. Gross profit increased by $29 million to $63 million in the second fiscal quarter versus the same period 1 year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by 510 basis points to 24.6% versus the same period a year ago and was 25 basis points lower sequentially. The margin rates exiting backlog continue to benefit from the favorable volume leverage and solid operational execution across all of our manufacturing facilities. There is no change from our last update in our gross profit percentage projections in the low to mid-20s throughout fiscal 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $21 million in the current period, lower by $1 million on a lower level of variable performance-based compensation versus the same period 1 year ago.\n\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 450 basis points to 8.2% in the current fiscal quarter on the higher revenue base and diligent overhead management. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we reported net income of $33.5 million, generating $2.75 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.5 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we generated $17 million of operating cash flow, driven by higher earnings generated in the second quarter, partially offset by a negative working capital impact as we allocate capital to fund projects in the order book. Investments in property, plant and equipment in the fiscal second quarter totaled $900,000. At March 31, 2024, we had cash and short-term investments of $365 million, compared to $279 million at September 30, 2023 and $355 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe company does not hold any debt. As we look forward, we are optimistic that our strategic focus to grow in tangential end markets, combined with the sustained strength across our core Industrial end markets will continue throughout fiscal 2024. We are cognizant, however, of the recent uncertainties in the macro environment that may have a timing impact on near-term LNG market activity. Notwithstanding this minor disruption from a commercial perspective, both the sustained level of market activity across our other end markets as well as the quality and level of our backlog positions the business favorably to sustain the momentum that we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2024 and continue our solid financial performance throughout the remainder of this fiscal year.\n\nAt this point, we'll be happy to answer your questions.\n\nSee also\n\n25 Cities with Tallest Buildings in the World and\n\n20 Best Business Ideas for Solopreneurs in 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Revenue: $255 million, up 49% year-over-year. Net Income: $33.5 million, significantly higher than $8.5 million year-over-year. Earnings Per Share (EPS): $2.75 per diluted share, compared to $0.7 year-over-year. Gross Margin: Increased to 24.6% of revenue, up 510 basis points from the previous year. New Orders: $235 million, reflecting strong booking volume. Backlog: Approximately $1.3 billion, nearly flat sequentially but significantly higher year-over-year. Operating Cash Flow: $17 million, driven by higher earnings.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NBN.\n\nRelease Date: May 01, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nPowell Industries Inc (NASDAQ:POWL) reported strong year-over-year growth with a 49% increase in revenue to $255 million, driven by performance in oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors. Net income significantly increased to $33.5 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, approximately four times higher than the previous year. The company's backlog remains robust at $1.3 billion, providing a solid foundation for future revenue. Operational efficiencies and process improvements initiated during the pandemic have continued to yield benefits, enhancing manufacturing processes and profitability. Expansion projects, including the $11 million expansion of the Electrical Products factory in Houston, are on track, supporting future growth and product development.\n\nNegative Points\n\nDespite strong performance, new orders in Q2 2024 were 54% lower compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the absence of mega-project bookings. The company faces competitive pressures and sensitivity to economic and industry conditions, which could impact future performance. Uncertainties in the macro environment, particularly concerning LNG market activities, could affect near-term project timings and bookings. Finding and retaining talented engineers remains a critical challenge that could affect the company's ability to increase throughput and manage an expanding backlog. While international revenue saw a slight increase, it remains a small portion of total revenue, indicating slower growth in global markets compared to domestic.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Good morning, Brett and Mike, and congratulations on the solid quarter. More like John, I'd like to start, I guess, with the top line because that surprised me the most personally from last quarter you kind of referenced you were running at full capacity, but we're still able to generate some really strong revenue gains in the quarter. I'm curious how should we think about that? Was there anything unusual as far as revenue recognition from? Is that a sustainable level can you just kind of walk us through how at full capacity can generate that kind of that size of a rate environment? A: John, it's Brett. I'll start and ask Mike to jump in here too up during the quarter about midway through the quarter. It did catch us a little surprise to it's a little lumpy as we look at all the things we're buying. So there when we looked at the results on the revenue side, there was a fair amount of large buyout and the way the POC works for us, it sort of jumped up a little bit. So looking at the back half of the year, I'm going to ask Mike to jump in here, but I don't I don't state that level that we just saw its potential just kind of depends on timing schedules move around, but it was a little bit higher than than we expected as we went into the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: And the like does that suggest that normal seasonality would be limited and won't see the big bump maybe in revenue? A: We typically see in the fourth quarter and maybe should think about a little bit flatter and know I think on the delta between the two Q. three Q. patent in the 4Q Cadence probably will be less than it normally is. But I still think traditionally Q4 is usually a seasonally heavier quarter from a fiscal standpoint, fiscal year standpoint as we as we profile the year.\n\nQ: Understood. And you maintained your gross margin expectations of low to mid 20s on. Would it limits to a better gross margin profile on you're seeing? A: Well, one of the biggest contributor has been has been the leverage and being this ramped up kind of for your earlier question, I think that is one of the limiting factors as we're kind of butting up against capacity is eking out that leverage, we're kind of down to cost management. And we've kind of echoed that throughout the organization on our operational reviews this spring that the incrementals can come on the cost side, always kind of COGS on the employee side, making sure we're getting good quality folks on the team and supporting them as best we can.\n\nQ: Okay. I guess one last question, I'll get back in the queue. The cash build has been sizable. I mean, historically, when had good revenues working capital capital outflows, I haven't seen the cash flow statement yet, but it doesn't seem to be the case. And can you talk about how we should think about cash usage as jobs ramp up and also your priorities for excess cash. Has the Board address maybe a potential special dividend or something along those lines. A: Okay. Yes, John, I'll start and then Brett can chime in here. First, I know as we sit here today, the $365 million of cash and marketable market securities, we feel has in large part plateaued. We consumed roughly $20 million of capital to fund working capital this quarter. It is the offset to that was replenishment with the balance in new orders and the orders cadence in backlog and the associated advanced payments. So we anticipate as we look forward, given the healthy and normalized booking Cadence providing cash inflows. This should the cash balance should maintain about where it is maybe slightly recede as we as we fund working capital and CapEx requirements in the second.\n\nQ: Morning, Brett. Good morning. We're going to come back to the revenue side of the business, Brad and Mike, what are you seeing in terms of sort of the quarterly book to burn numbers? We've talked about this in the past, Mike, but has that accelerated? Is that more than what is typically the case? A: That's been pretty static, John, on over the past several quarters, and we've typically run 30 to $40 million a quarter of book-to-bill on top of the recognition of that backlog burn. So no, that's been pretty stable.\n\nQ: Okay. Very good. And pricing, Tom, when we look at pricing throughout the quarter. Any benefit from pricing? A: Nothing free, but very flat for a couple of quarters now there's always some opportunity there, but some schedule still dictates overall, I'd say on the competition and where we're at in the market. But pricing has become gradually more of a factor as not so much for Paul. But the Engineered Components is still throttle. Most of what we compete on and we're out in the market and it's got it's improved.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Eaton (ETN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $333.06 in the previous session. Eaton has gained 32.2% since the start of the year compared to the 5.6% move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 15.2% return for the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 30, 2024, Eaton reported EPS of $2.4 versus consensus estimate of $2.28 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.72%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Eaton is expected to post earnings of $10.33 per share on $25 billion in revenues. This represents a 13.27% change in EPS on a 7.79% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $11.62 per share on $26.9 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.48% and 7.57%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nEaton may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nEaton has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 30.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 21.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 27.7X versus its peer group's average of 18.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.63. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Eaton currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Eaton meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Eaton shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nHow Does ETN Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of ETN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL). POWL has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Powell Industries, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 45.50%, and for the current fiscal year, POWL is expected to post earnings of $7.54 per share on revenue of $839.17 million.\n\nShares of Powell Industries, Inc. have gained 5.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 18.97X and a P/CF of 28.98X.\n\nThe Manufacturing - Electronics industry is in the top 31% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ETN and POWL, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Powell Industries Announces Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Results",
        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc.\n\nHOUSTON, April 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: POWL), a leading supplier of custom-engineered solutions for the management, control and distribution of electrical energy, today announced results for the Fiscal 2024 second quarter ended March 31, 2024. All comparisons are to the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, unless otherwise noted.\n\nSecond Quarter Key Highlights:\n\nRevenues totaled $255 million, an increase of 49%; Gross profit of $63 million, or 24.6% of revenue, a 510 basis point improvement; Net income of $33 million, or $2.75 per diluted share; New orders(1) totaled $235 million; Backlog(2) as of March 31, 2024, remained at $1.3 billion; Cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2024, totaled $365 million.\n\nBrett A. Cope, Powell\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \u201cPowell delivered solid second quarter results supported by continued growth within our Industrial end markets as well as strong performances from both our Electric Utility and Commercial and Other Industrial markets. Revenue in the quarter was 49% higher than the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, while excellent project execution and volume leverage drove a 510 basis point improvement in gross margin to 24.6%. New orders of $235 million in the quarter were higher by 19% sequentially and were well-balanced across the markets we serve, keeping our backlog essentially unchanged at $1.3 billion. Overall, we are encouraged by both our financial performance in the first half of the year as well as the activity levels within each of the markets we serve.\u201d\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Results\r\nRevenues totaled $255.1 million compared to $171.4 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, and $194.0 million in the first fiscal quarter. The increase compared to second quarter of Fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by strong growth across the Oil and Gas and Petrochemical sectors, which grew 66% and 93%, respectively. Revenue from the Commercial and Other Industrial sector increased 57%, and revenue from the Electric Utility sector grew 11%.\n\nGross profit increased 88% to $62.7 million, or 24.6% of revenue, compared to $33.4 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 and compares to $48.2 million, or 24.8% of revenue, in the first fiscal quarter.\n\nNew orders totaled $235 million compared to $508 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 and $198 million in the first fiscal quarter. The year-over-year decline was the result of two large, domestic projects in the LNG and Petrochemical markets awarded in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBacklog totaled $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, which was essentially flat sequentially compared to backlog as of December 31, 2023, and increased 25% compared to backlog of $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2023.\n\nNet income was $33.5 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared to $8.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 and $24.1 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in the first fiscal quarter.\n\nCope added, \u201cProject activity across the markets we serve remains active. We anticipate that projects within the LNG market will continue to progress, however, based upon the recent pause on LNG export permitting by the Department of Energy, the timing of these future projects may be impacted. We are experiencing continued growth of our Commercial and Other Industrial sector, as well as the Electric Utility sector, while also seeing strong activity related to energy transition projects. We remain encouraged by the growth dynamics across the markets in which we compete and are well positioned to support these newer applications with Powell\u2019s products and expertise.\u201d\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nCommenting on the Company's outlook, Michael Metcalf, Powell\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, said, \u201cWe continue to expect another strong year of financial performance in Fiscal 2024 as our core Industrial end markets, as well as our Electric Utility and Commercial and Other Industrial markets, are exhibiting favorable dynamics and activity levels to support our growth. The quality and duration of our backlog, in conjunction with the level of commercial activity, also support our expectation that this strong financial performance can be sustained throughout Fiscal 2024 and into Fiscal 2025. Our capacity initiatives focused on servicing current and future backlog remain on track and are progressing as planned, with our Gulf Coast fabrication yard expansion now fully utilized and helping to support the execution of our $1.3 billion backlog. We expect to complete the current capacity expansion initiative at our products factory in Houston by mid-Fiscal 2025, which will help to enable our initiatives to facilitate future growth.\u201d\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\r\nPowell Industries has scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, May 1, 2024 at 11:00\u00a0a.m. Eastern time.

        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc. POWL is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Mar 31, 2024) results on Apr 30, after market open.\r\n\r\nThe company has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average beat being 77.6%. In the last reported quarter, its earnings of $1.98 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 by 98%.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for Powell this earnings season.\n\nKey Factors and Estimates for Q2\n\nSolid momentum across petrochemical, oil and gas, utility and commercial and other industrial sectors is expected to have aided the company\u2019s performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Also, strength in the core oil and gas markets (excluding petrochemical) is likely to have driven Powell\u2019s results.\r\n\r\nInvestment in POWL\u2019s Houston facility, which expanded fabrication and integration support for its large power control rooms, is expected to have bolstered top-line results.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $206 million, suggesting an increase of 20.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. The consensus estimate for the company\u2019s adjusted earnings is pinned at $1.89 per share, indicating a 170% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\r\n\r\nHowever, over time, Powell\u2019s performance has been negatively impacted by high costs and expenses. An increase in raw material cost is likely to have been a spoilsport in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s international presence exposes it to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, which are likely to have hurt its performance.\n\nPowell Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPowell Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Powell Industries, Inc. Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for POWL this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Powell has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.89. You can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Powell presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies within the broader Industrial Products sector, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in this reporting cycle.\r\n\r\nAtmus Filtration Technologies Inc. ATMU has an Earnings ESP of +0.57% and a Zacks Rank of 1, at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe company is slated to release first-quarter results on May 3. ATMU delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.3%, on average.\r\n\r\nChart Industries, Inc. GTLS has an Earnings ESP of +9.86% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Powell Industries (POWL) closed at $146.31, marking a -1.96% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.46%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.98%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.64%.\n\nShares of the energy equipment company witnessed a gain of 6.53% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Industrial Products sector with its loss of 2.71% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.04%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Powell Industries will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on April 30, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.89, signifying a 170% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $205.73 million, up 20% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.54 per share and a revenue of $839.17 million, representing changes of +83.01% and +20%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Powell Industries. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 154, this industry ranks in the bottom 39% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "title": "Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this energy equipment company have returned +6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, which Powell Industries falls in, has lost 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPowell Industries is expected to post earnings of $1.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +170%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +83%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 indicates a change of +1.3% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Powell Industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $205.73 million indicates a year-over-year change of +20%. For the current and next fiscal years, $839.17 million and $872.74 million estimates indicate +20% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $194.02 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.9%. EPS of $1.98 for the same period compares with $0.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $180.1 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.73%. The EPS surprise was +98%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investors interested in Manufacturing - Electronics stocks are likely familiar with Powell Industries (POWL) and Eaton (ETN). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nCurrently, both Powell Industries and Eaton are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nPOWL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.02, while ETN has a forward P/E of 30.43. We also note that POWL has a PEG ratio of 1.36. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.59.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for POWL is its P/B ratio of 4.68. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ETN has a P/B of 6.55.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to POWL's Value grade of B and ETN's Value grade of D.\n\nBoth POWL and ETN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that POWL is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) ended the recent trading session at $123.44, demonstrating a -1.56% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.58%.

Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $205.73 million, indicating a 20% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $7.54 per share and a revenue of $839.17 million, signifying shifts of +83.01% and +20%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Powell Industries. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "content": "While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.\n\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.\n\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\n\nOne stock to keep an eye on is Powell Industries (POWL). POWL is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 16.66, while its industry has an average P/E of 25.38. Over the past year, POWL's Forward P/E has been as high as 24.80 and as low as 14.65, with a median of 18.11.\n\nInvestors should also note that POWL holds a PEG ratio of 1.19. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. POWL's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.18. Within the past year, POWL's PEG has been as high as 1.77 and as low as 1.05, with a median of 1.29.\n\nValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. POWL has a P/S ratio of 1.96. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.63.\n\nThese are just a handful of the figures considered in Powell Industries's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that POWL is an impressive value stock right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Powell Industries (POWL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this energy equipment company have returned -22.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry, to which Powell Industries belongs, has gained 0.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Powell Industries is expected to post earnings of $1.89 per share, indicating a change of +170% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +83%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 indicates a change of +1.3% from what Powell Industries is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Powell Industries.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Powell Industries, the consensus sales estimate of $205.73 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +20%. The $839.17 million and $872.74 million estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20% and +4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPowell Industries reported revenues of $194.02 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.9%. EPS of $1.98 for the same period compares with $0.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $180.1 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.73%. The EPS surprise was +98%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Powell Industries surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPowell Industries is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Powell Industries. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The segment\u2019s revenues increased 6.8% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended December 2023). Strength in automation and electrification markets has been driving the performance of the Motive Power segment. The global megatrends, including 5G expansion, rural broadband build-outs, electrification, automation and decarbonization, are expected to support the company\u2019s growth in the quarters ahead.\r\n\r\nEnerSys believes in adding complementary businesses to its portfolio via acquisitions. In April 2023, it acquired UK-based battery service and maintenance provider, Industrial Battery and Charger Services Limited (IBCS). The inclusion of IBCS strengthened its foothold in the U.K. market. It also augmented ENS\u2019 comprehensive range of battery-related services, including installation and maintenance, and repair and replacement.\r\n\r\nENS remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. For instance, it paid out dividends of $25.4 million and repurchased shares worth $82.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Its quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 29% in August 2023.

The segment\u2019s revenues decreased 14% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Lower demand in the network communications, and telecom and broadband markets remains concerning for the company.\r\n\r\nHigh capital expenditures might also hurt the company\u2019s bottom line in the near-term.

        "title": "Reasons to Add A. O. Smith (AOS) Stock to Your Portfolio Now",
        "content": "A. O. Smith Corporation AOS stands to benefit from strength across its businesses, acquisitions and focus on operational excellence. The company remains focused on investing in growth opportunities and strengthening its long-term market position. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt has a market capitalization of $12.9 billion. Over the past six months, it has gained 27.6% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 35.4%. AOS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s delve into the factors that have been aiding the firm for a while now.\r\n\r\nBusiness Strength: A. O. Smith has been witnessing strong demand for water heaters in North America and higher kitchen product sales in China. For 2024, the company expects North American boiler sales and water treatment sales to increase 8-10% and 10-12% from the year-ago levels, respectively. The introduction of kitchen appliances in China is expected to continue boosting revenues for the Rest of the World segment.\r\n\r\nDriven by strong demand for its products, management has issued a bullish guidance. A. O. Smith forecasts sales to increase approximately 3-5% from the prior-year actuals in 2024. It estimates adjusted earnings of $3.90-$4.15 per share in the year, implying growth of 5.6% at the mid-point from the year-earlier figure.\r\n\r\nAcquisition Benefits: AOS believes in adding complementary businesses to its portfolio via acquisitions. Its acquisition of Atlantic Filter in June 2022 boosted its position in the water treatment industry, and strengthened its customer base in Florida and adjacent regions. Also, the buyout of Canada-based Giant Factories in October 2021 expanded its commercial and water heater offerings.\r\n\r\nShareholder-Friendly Policies: The company remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. For instance, in 2023, the firm rewarded shareholders with dividends of $183.5 million, reflecting an increase of 3.6% year over year. In the same year, AOS repurchased 4.4 million shares for approximately $306.5 million. Also, it hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 7% in October 2023.\r\n\r\nStrong Liquidity Position; The company\u2019s sound liquidity position adds to its strength. It exited 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $339.9 million, significantly higher than the current debt of $10 million. This implies that AOS has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations.\n\nStory continues\n\n3 Other Promising Stocks\n\nSome other top-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.\r\n\r\nPowell Industries, Inc.

        "title": "Contrary to Eurozone, US Manufacturing Picks Up: 4 Gainers",
        "content": "Manufacturing activity in the euro area remained sluggish since the coronavirus outbreak. International trade strains and a moribund automobile industry disrupted economic growth in the eurozone. Manufacturing output, regrettably, contracted at a steeper pace last month as demand continued to wane.\n\nCompiled by S&P Global, the HCOB\u2019s Eurozone Manufacturing PMI dropped to 46.1 in March from February\u2019s reading of 46.5. The index stayed below the 50 mark, indicating contraction in factory output. The index notched a twelfth consecutive monthly decline in factory production in March.\n\nHowever, manufacturing activity bounced back in the United States, crushing apprehensions about an impending recession. The manufacturing PMI of the Institute of Supply Management climbed to 50.3% in March from 47.8% in February. Thus, the business conditions on the manufacturing side of the economy are on the mend.\n\nThe pipeline for new orders remained robust while production picked up. Employment in manufacturing outlets also improved substantially. So, what\u2019s leading to an uptick in manufacturing activity in the United States? Lest we forget, manufacturing took a beating for quite some time due to sticky inflation and a shift in spending trends from industrial products to services such as travel, dining out and other recreational activities.\n\nHowever, a change in the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy stance led to a full-blown recovery in the manufacturing side of the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell wasn\u2019t taken aback by the recent jump in the PCE index, while the central bank assured interest rate cuts later this year. The Fed\u2019s dovish stance will reduce the cost of borrowing, a blessing in disguise for manufacturers as it will boost demand.\n\nThus, with the key measure of factory output picking up in the United States, industrial stocks, particularly, are well-poised to gain. This calls for investing in stocks such as H&E Equipment Services, Inc. HEES, AZZ Inc. AZZ, Luxfer Holdings PLC LXFR and Powell Industries, Inc. POWL.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nH&E Equipment Services is one of the largest integrated equipment services companies. HEES presently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 3.1% over the past 60 days. HEES\u2019 expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5%.\n\nAZZ is a global provider of metal-coating services. AZZ currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has increased 0.9% over the past 60 days. AZZ\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.6%.\n\nLuxfer designs, manufactures and supplies high-performance materials. LXFR presently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 111.4% over the past 60 days. LXFR\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 21.3%.\n\nPowell Industries is a metal-working shop that supports petrochemical facilities. POWL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has increased 3.7% over the past 60 days. POWL\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 83%.\n\nShares of H&E Equipment Services, AZZ, Luxfer and Powell Industries have gained 21.2%, 33.7%, 14%, and 51.6%, respectively, year to date.

        "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Manufacturing - Electronics sector might want to consider either Powell Industries (POWL) or Eaton (ETN). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, Powell Industries is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Eaton has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that POWL has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPOWL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.33, while ETN has a forward P/E of 30.23. We also note that POWL has a PEG ratio of 1.31. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.57.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for POWL is its P/B ratio of 4.51. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ETN has a P/B of 6.49.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, POWL holds a Value grade of B, while ETN has a Value grade of D.\n\nStory continues\n\nPOWL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

        "content": "Emerson Electric Co. EMR has been experiencing healthy demand across most of its end markets. Solid demand in the process and hybrid markets is boosting the company\u2019s underlying orders. Management anticipates sales in the process and hybrid end markets to be robust in fiscal 2024 (ending September 2024), driven by strength in chemical, life sciences, LNG, metals and mining, and sustainability and decarbonization end markets.\r\n\r\nWithin the Intelligent Devices business unit, the company is seeing strength in the measurement and analytical, and final control businesses supported by strong demand in the hybrid and process end markets. Given the strength across its end markets, Emerson expects net sales to increase 12.5-14.5% from the year-ago levels in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending March 2024).\r\n\r\nEmerson intends to strengthen and expand its businesses through buyouts. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company completed the acquisitions of Afag and Flexim. The Afag buyout expanded EMR\u2019s capabilities in factory automation, helping it expand into battery manufacturing, automotive and electronics markets. The acquisition of Flexim expanded its automation portfolio and measurement capabilities.\r\n\r\nAlso, the buyout of National Instruments in October 2023 strengthened EMR\u2019s position in semiconductor, electronics, transportation & electric vehicles and aerospace & defense markets.\r\n\r\nManagement remains committed to increasing shareholders\u2019 value through dividend payments and share repurchases. For instance, in first-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended December 2023), it paid out dividends of $300 million and repurchased common stocks worth $175 million. In October 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 1%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past month, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 6.4% compared with the industry\u2019s 5.8% growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, EMR has been witnessing softness in its test and measurement business within the Software and Control segment. In the fiscal first quarter, test and measurement business\u2019 orders declined 17% year over year owing to the continued softness in discrete and semiconductor markets, and ongoing weakness in China.\r\n\r\nEscalating operating costs and expenses have been weighing on its profitability. For instance, in the fiscal first quarter, its cost of sales jumped 25.6% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24%. Pre-tax margin came in at 3.4% in the quarter, down from 12.5% in the year-ago fiscal quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.\r\n\r\nPowell Industries, Inc.

        "title": "What Does Powell Industries, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:POWL) Share Price Indicate?",
        "content": "Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a significant share price rise of 109% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. Less-covered, small caps tend to present more of an opportunity for mispricing due to the lack of information available to the public, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let\u2019s take a look at Powell Industries\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Powell Industries\n\nIs Powell Industries Still Cheap?\n\nAccording to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Powell Industries\u2019s ratio of 24.86x is trading slightly above its industry peers\u2019 ratio of 20.85x, which means if you buy Powell Industries today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Powell Industries should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Furthermore, Powell Industries\u2019s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward.\n\nWhat does the future of Powell Industries look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 21% over the next year, the near-term future seems bright for Powell Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? POWL\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at POWL? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on POWL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for POWL, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Powell Industries.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Powell Industries, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "4 Stocks to Buy From the Thriving Manufacturing Electronics Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry is poised to benefit from steady demand across the electronic services end market, growing adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes and product innovation efforts. A surge in e-commerce activities is also likely to foster the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nHowever, challenges in the manufacturing sector amid persistent supply-chain issues have been denting the performance of some industry players. Eaton Corporation plc ETN, Emerson Electric Co. EMR, Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation ZWS and Powell Industries, Inc. POWL are a few industry participants that might capitalize on prevalent opportunities.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users. The companies are increasing investments in developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience and supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.\n\nTrends Shaping the Manufacturing Electronics Industry's Future\n\nWeakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management report, in February 2024, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index) touched 47.8%, contracting for the 16th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. Also, the New Orders Index returned to the contraction territory at 49.2% in February, declining 3.3 percentage points from the figure recorded in January. In addition, supply-chain disruptions, especially related to the availability of electronic components, remain a concern for industry participants of late. This is evident from the latest ISM report\u2019s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected slower deliveries in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrength in the Electronics Services Market: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets remains stable. The electronics manufacturers are steadily benefiting from higher adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes by original equipment manufacturers. The requirement for integrating advanced electronic components into machinery and electronic devices has been supporting the electronics manufacturing services market. In addition, industry players like Emerson Electric with wide exposure to the booming medical and life science markets, are witnessing a positive momentum across their businesses owing to sturdy demand for their products and solutions. A surge in the e-commerce business also boosted several industry participants\u2019 prospects.\n\nTechnological Advancement Benefits: With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, several industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. With digitization, businesses are gaining a detailed insight into their operational performance, demand cycles, delivery status and supply-chain issues. This, in turn, is helping them bolster their competitiveness in the market with enhanced operational productivity, product quality and lower costs.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #27. This rank places it in the top 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are keeping more faith in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry\u2019s earnings estimates for the current year have increased 11.9% in the past year.\r\n\r\nGiven the upbeat near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks for your consideration. But it is worth looking at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Outperforms Sector & the S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry has outperformed the broader sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite index in the past year.\r\n\r\nOver this period, the industry has rallied 41.8% compared with the sector\u2019s and S&P 500 Index\u2019s growth of 21.8% and 30.6%, respectively.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 24.23X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.93X. It is also above the sector\u2019s P/E ratio of 18.36X.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.22X, as low as 13.90X and at the median of 21.67X, as the chart below shows.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio vs SP500\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio vs Sector\n\n4 Manufacturing - Electronics Stocks to Buy\n\nPowell Industries: Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company is engaged in designing, manufacturing, and distributing custom-engineered equipment and systems. POWL's portfolio includes products like integrated power control room substations, custom-engineered modules, electrical houses and medium-voltage circuit breakers, among others.\r\n\r\nStrength across petrochemical, oil and gas, utility, commercial and other industrial end markets, along with a solid backlog, is a key catalyst behind this company\u2019s growth.\r\n\r\nShares of Powell Industries have skyrocketed 266.4% in the past year. The company reported better-than-expected results in each of the last two quarters, the average being 77.6%.

Also, its robust backlog level and acquisitions of Afag and Flexim are likely to boost its performance.\r\n\r\nShares of the Zacks Rank #2 company have increased 33.1% in the past year.

        "title": "3 Supercharged Stocks to Buy Before the Next S&amp;P 500 All-Time High",
        "content": "The S&P 500 keeps hitting new record highs this year. It dipped the other day as new inflation data all but killed the hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March. Yet consumer confidence is growing the economy won\u2019t crash, which suggests the broad-based index will eventually shrug off the sour price news. This backdrop has led to this list of stocks to buy.\n\nLast year the index gained 24% on the backs of a small group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven. In 2024, many more companies are perpetuating the rally higher. That makes these three supercharged companies the stocks to buy today. Do it before the S&P 500 gains it senses once more and aims for its next all-time high.\n\nFastly (FSLY) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nFastly (NASDAQ:FSLY) is one of the leading edge computing stocks. That\u2019s a fancy term for moving cloud resources closer to where users create the content. By locating resources there, it improves and increases response times. Edge computing is a fast-moving market that is expected to grow from $16.5 billion in 2023 to $156 billion in 2030, a 38% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is Fastly\u2019s job to bump up speeds by reducing data latency and improving content delivery. It offers enhanced content delivery, improved image optimization, video and streaming, and a variety of application security services. As businesses continuously move more data to the cloud they\u2019re turning to Fastly in greater numbers and spending more with it. This makes it one of those stocks to buy.\n\nDollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER), or how much more existing customers are spending, rose to 123% for the quarter. That means they spent 23% more than the same period last year. And spending by enterprise customers, or those spending over $25,000 per quarter, increased 5% sequentially. Enterprise customers account for over 90% of Fastly\u2019s total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince I first identified Fastly as a proven winner to buy last November FSLY stock jumped 39%. But the edge computing expert has much more room to grow. It\u2019s a stock you will want to buy ahead of the S&P 500 resuming its run higher.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) A photograph of the inside of a factory showing machinery and conveyer belts representing AIMC Stock.\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets/ShutterStock.com\n\nElectrical equipment supplier Powell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) is another unstoppable stock I highlighted earlier this month that\u2019s been off to the races. Shares are up over 20% since.\n\nPowell makes electrical systems for petroleum, oil and gas producers, refineries, liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and utilities. The energy industry remains a hotbed of opportunity because of the need and demand for fossil fuels. Renewables can\u2019t hope to meet the large scale requirements of today\u2019s grid and people are returning to the reliability of oil and gas.\n\nAlthough POWL stock dipped on the inflation news as fears of a harder-than-expected economic landing took hold, investors should have no worries. Revenue is on fire for the specialized equipment maker. Even though it is a seasonally slow period, sales shot 53% higher in the fiscal first quarter while recording $198 million in new orders. That was a 15% sequential gain for Powell.\n\nLooking out longer term, Powell reported its backlog of orders nearly doubled to $1.3 billion. That suggests that even if the economy wilts the equipment supplier can safely skate through the downturn.\u00a0It\u2019s definitely one of those stocks to buy.\n\nXPO (XPO) logistics stocks. supply chain stocks\n\nSource: Travel mania / Shutterstock.com\n\nLess-than-truckload (LTL) leader XPO (NYSE:XPO) is a stock that has long been on my radar. Founded in 2012 by Bradley Jacobs, a man with a golden touch when it comes to starting new businesses, the logistics firm generated over 3,500% in total return since its IPO. In contrast, the S&P 500 is up less than 800%. Look for XPO to continue on its growth trajectory.\n\nJacobs is a serial entrepreneur who created numerous businesses from scratch and transformed them into billion-dollar outlets.. He subsequently made huge profits by selling them at a premium, including at Amerex Oil, Hamilton Resources, United Waste, and United Rentals (NYSE:URI).\n\nXPO spun off its GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO) business that manages outsourced supply chains and warehousing globally. It also shed its RXO (NYSE:RXO) truck brokerage firm. XPO\u2019s plans to calve off its European operations in 2022 were put on hold due to weak capital markets. Expect it to be eventually cast off.\n\nWhat\u2019s left is a slimmed-down but solid transportation fleet for LTL shipping. XPO reduced damage claims to all-time lows, added new terminals and drivers, and enhanced available technology to improve efficiency. As a result, it is seeing more business, greater revenue, and higher adjusted profits.\n\nWhere rival Yellow filed for bankruptcy, and both UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported tough headwinds, XPO is heading to the open road and driving higher. XPO stock is one you will want to climb behind the wheel with for long-term growth. All in all, it\u2019s one of those stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Growth stocks are very attractive for investors due to their upside potential, typically for a number of reasons, including recent positive earnings reports, acquisitions, partnerships, rating upgrades, and improved sales forecasts, among other catalysts.\u00a0These are characteristic of high-momentum stocks.\n\nDealing with stocks experiencing greater than-expected growth and comparing said company to its peers is vital to determine if it is just one company that is affected or an industry-wide phenomenon, allowing for more educated investment decisions.\n\nHigh-momentum stocks share a common factor: a recent surging share price showing no sign of stopping. Below are several stocks that have seen exponential growth recently and should be on every investor watchlist.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a technology company that produces hardware and software products for server storage, such as motherboards, processors, networking solutions, and various chassis.\n\nOver this last year, SMCI\u2019s stock price has surged by over eightfold. This is due to several factors, including its solid balance sheet and the increased investor attention toward companies within the data center and cloud computing businesses.\n\nOn January 29, Super Micro Computer\u00a0reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, stating that its revenue more than doubled and its net income rose by 68% compared to the previous year. Due to growing demand for its AI platform and other IT-related products, Super Micro improved its revenue guidance for fiscal year 2024.\n\nSMCI has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market over the past year, and even with it more than doubling its share price in just the last month, it continues to climb. It is a very strong company that has reported impressive earnings and provides exposure to popular industries such as generative, cloud computing, and IT solutions\u2014making it a no-brainer for a stock watchlist.\n\nStory continues\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) A photograph of the inside of a factory showing machinery and conveyer belts representing AIMC Stock.\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets/ShutterStock.com\n\nPowell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) is an engineered systems manufacturer with products such as integrated power circuits, electrical housings, circuit breakers, and duct systems that serve utilities and energy businesses.\n\nIn late January, Powell Industries reported its\u00a0first quarter earnings for FY 2024, stating that total revenue increased by 53% from the previous year. Net income in Q1 FY2023 was approximately $1.2 million, and for Q1 2024, it was reported as $24.1 million. Powell cites that the increase in overall sales was due to improved sales within multiple industries, including oil and gas, utilities, and petrochemicals.\n\nPowell saw a sharp increase in its share price by nearly 50% on the day its earnings were released due to blowing previous\u00a0analysts\u2019 expectations out of the water. Most notably, Earnings per share was antiquated to be reported at eighty-four cents per share, but it was one dollar and ninety-eight cents per share.\n\nEver since this stunning earnings report, its share price has continued to rise, and it will be interesting to see if Powell can keep growing at an exponential rate due to their strong financial position, a robust backlog that has nearly doubled from the prior year, and increased investor attention.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Used car market: a row of cars of different makes and models sitting on a lot.\n\nSource: Mikbiz / Shutterstock\n\nToyota Motor (NYSE:TM) manufactures vehicles such as minivans, sedans, pickup trucks, SUVs, buses, and luxury cars under its brand Lexus. It also operates a financial services segment that provides leasing.\n\nOver this past year, its stock price has increased by 57%, which has outpaced other popular auto manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F), which have seen a slight decrease in their stock price within the same period.\n\nOn February 6, Toyota reported earnings for the\u00a0third quarter of FY 2024, which stated that its earnings per share more than doubled and total revenue increased by 24% compared to the year before. And Toyota also raised its outlook for FY 2024 as well. Following this recent earnings report, Toyota has seen an increase in its share price of over 10%.\n\nToyota is on a solid growth trajectory due partly to its large market share of the auto manufacturing business, in which they are only behind Tesla in terms of market capitalization. Toyota has seen a strong bounce-back year following 2022, which saw a fairly substantial drop in its overall stock price. An improved financial position and increased financial outlook make Toyota a definite addition to an investment watchlist, and is one of those high-momentum stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG\u00a0position in TM.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "As of last November, the Biden administration had disbursed $306 billion of the more than $850 billion in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds. Moreover, the think tank reported, \u201c80% of all competitive funding (was) still left to be awarded.\u201d Nonetheless, Caterpillar\u2019s (NYSE:CAT) impressive fourth-quarter results, reported on Feb. 5, indicate that infrastructure stocks can benefit from Washington\u2019s infrastructure spending spree.\n\nAlso importantly, the price-earnings ratios of many firms in the sector, in contrast with most tech names, are quite low. And going forward, American infrastructure companies are very well-positioned to continue benefiting from the federal government\u2019s continued, large investments in infrastructure. For investors who want to benefit from this strong trend that will last many years, here are the three best infrastructure stocks to buy now.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s profit soared both last quarter and in all of 2023. In Q4, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, soared 35% versus the same period a year earlier to $5.23. For all of 2023, its adjusted EPS jumped 53% to $21.21.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to the U.S. government\u2019s high infrastructure spending, I believe that CAT is benefiting from the onshoring trend in America, with spending on the construction of factories growing rapidly to record levels in the last two years. That trend should continue, with the EV Boom, the Green Energy Revolution, Washington\u2019s subsidies for semiconductor factories and the need for new data centers to facilitate the AI Revolution. This will result in new plants in America and many other advanced nations.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the world\u2019s increased demand for minerals, many of which are needed to facilitate the EV Boom and the Green Revolution, is boosting CAT\u2019s mining-equipment business.\n\nAs the firm grows and the demand for its products surges, its profit margins are also jumping. Specifically, its operating profit margin jumped to 18.4% last quarter from 10.1 in Q4 of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe forward price-earnings ratio of CAT stock is a low 15.4.\n\nQuanta Services (PWR) Environmental technology concept.

Infrastructure stocks.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, Quanta (NYSE:PWR) \u201cis very well-positioned to benefit from the shift to electrified transportation.\u201d It \u201cbuilds infrastructure, electrical power stations, facilities for renewable energy and natural gas transmission.\u201d As a result, it\u2019s definitely one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s playing a key role in two side-by-side initiatives in New Mexico which, according to PWR, taken together, \u00a0\u201d represent the largest clean energy infrastructure project in United States history,\u201d\n\nAccording to KeyBanc, the SunZia projects alone are going to generate about 5% of PWR\u2019s EBITDA in 2024.\n\nMoreover, Quanta will also benefit from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is investing a great deal of money in building up the country\u2019s electrical grid.\n\nThe Street appears to be becoming quite fond of Quanta. On Jan. 16, Citi named PWR as one of its 20 favorite large-cap stocks. And on Dec. 13, Bank of America identified PWR as one of the names that had momentum in three areas: \u201cearnings, price, and sentiment.\u201d\n\nGiven PWR\u2019s strong growth outlook, its forward price-earnings ratio of 24.6 is quite attractive.\n\nPowell Industries (POWL) Picture of a highway system with business statistics on top of it. Infrastructure stocks.\n\nSource: ekapol sirachainan / Shutterstock\n\nPowell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) specializes in manufacturing and selling electrical equipment. Like Quanta, the electrification of transportation and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will benefit Powell.\n\nIndeed, the firm does appear to be benefiting from these trends as its top line soared 53% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its earnings per share came in at $1.98, way up from $0.10 in the same quarter of 2022. Also noteworthy is that the firm\u2019s backlog surged almost 100% year-over-year to $1.3 billion.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see encouraging levels of project activity across the majority of our core Industrial end markets,\u201d said CEO Brett Cope in a statement. He added that the firm is also getting a lift from the expansion of data centers and Green Energy projects.\n\nThe forward price-earnings ratio of POWL stock is 22.4. That\u2019s quite low, given the company\u2019s tremendous growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
