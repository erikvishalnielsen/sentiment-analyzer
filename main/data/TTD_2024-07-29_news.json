        "content": "Why The Trade Desk (TTD) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of advertising software maker The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) fell 10.4% in the afternoon session after major indices declined, with the Nasdaq down 3%, while the S&P 500 fell by 1.7% following weaker-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (YouTube Advertising revenue missed estimates) and Tesla (7% drop in auto revenue).\n\nIn recent weeks, tech giants, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple, have shed some of their year-to-date gains as a new market narrative\u2014in favor of small-caps stocks\u2014gains some momentum following the growing conviction that the Fed will start to cut rates in the second half of the year. Notably, the Russell 2000 index has gained 9% since the beginning of the month. The sentiment also benefitted from improved inflation prints last month, as the headline numbers edged closer to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nOverall, the shift suggests investors are finding more reasons to hold positions in risk assets, especially small caps that tend to be more volatile.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy The Trade Desk? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nThe Trade Desk's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for The Trade Desk and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago, when the stock dropped 29.1% on the news that the company reported third quarter results and provided revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance below expectations. Management added that \"we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4.\" The markets had been skittish about the macro, and The Trade Desk is a company heavily tied to macro-sensitive advertising, so the weak outlook likely raised\u00a0alarm.\n\nOn the other hand, its revenue narrowly topped analysts' expectations. While it was objectively a mixed quarter for The Trade Desk since results were fine, the guidance was weak, and the market seemed spooked about the future.\n\nThe Trade Desk is up 28.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $90.54 per share it is still trading 10.8% below its 52-week high of $101.52 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of The Trade Desk's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,649.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "title": "Investors in Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) have seen strong returns of 281% over the past five years",
        "content": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) stock is up an impressive 281% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 20% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 9.0% in the last three months.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Trade Desk achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 31% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 245.20.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Trade Desk has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this freereport showing consensus revenue forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nTrade Desk provided a TSR of 21% over the year. That's fairly close to the broader market return. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 31% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Trade Desk a stock worth watching. Before spending more time on Trade Desk it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search The Trade Desk (TTD): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "The Trade Desk (TTD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this digital-advertising platform operator have returned +3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which The Trade Desk belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, The Trade Desk is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share, indicating a change of +28.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +24.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.90 indicates a change of +21.1% from what The Trade Desk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Trade Desk.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TTD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of The Trade Desk, the consensus sales estimate of $577.55 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.4%. The $2.42 billion and $2.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +24.5% and +21.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nThe Trade Desk reported revenues of $491.25 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.3%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $480.03 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +18.18%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, The Trade Desk surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nThe Trade Desk is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Trade Desk. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Trade Desk\u2019s TTD shares have gained 39.6% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 21.5% gain and the Zacks Internet Services return of 22.8%.\r\n\r\nTTD is benefiting from an expanding clientele. Over the past 12 months, its platform has been used by the largest 200 advertisers in the world to run their advertising campaigns. \r\n\r\nA strong partner base that includes the likes of Disney DIS, Comcast\u2019s NBCU, Walmart WMT, Amazon, Roku, Fox FOXA, VerticalScope Holdings, foodpanda and LG Electronics has been a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nTTD shares are expected to continue this upward trajectory, driven by these factors. Technical indicator is also bullish for The Trade Desk as the shares trade above the 50-day moving average, which indicates robust upward momentum and price stability.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the Value Style Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nTTD stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 18.07X compared with the Zacks IT Services industry\u2019s 5.98X.\n\nP/S Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHence, the question for investors is whether this is the right time to invest or if they should wait for a better opportunity. Let\u2019s dig deep to find the investment opportunity present by TTD shares currently.\n\nStrong CTV Demand to Aid Top-Line Growth\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, TTD reported revenues of $491 million, up 28% year over year, driven by strong adoption of its CTV, retail media, Kokai and UID2 solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $162 million.\r\n\r\nIn the near term, The Trade Desk is expected to benefit from strong spending in the CTV and retail media domains. CTV is its fastest-growing channel, as it reaches more than 90 million households and more than 120 million CTV devices.\r\n\r\nTTD benefits from the growing demand for digital and programmatic advertisement. Total advertising addressable market is trending towards $1 trillion, which presents a significant growth opportunity for The Trade Desk. Expanding international business also bodes well for TTD\u2019s prospects.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across TTD\u2019s two initiatives, namely UID2 and OpenPass, which focus on identity and authentication in the post-cookie era, benefits from increased demand for its advertising services.\r\n\r\nExpanding partner base has been a key catalyst for The Trade Desk. Integrations with Disney\u2019s real-time ad exchange, which includes Hulu and Disney+ through TTD\u2019s OpenPath technology, have been a game changer. \r\n\r\nFOXA-TTD\u2019s integration includes The Trade Desk\u2019s UID2 identity solution and its OpenPath initiative across Fox's AdRise ad platform.\n\nStory continues\n\n2024 Estimate Revision Shows Upward Movement\n\nThe Trade Desk estimates second-quarter revenues to be at least $575 million, suggesting growth of approximately 24% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $223 million.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $577.55 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 24.41%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 36 cents per share, unchanged over the past 60 days. \r\n\r\nFor the full year, the estimate revision is positive, indicating the benefits of strong demand for its solutions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TTD\u2019s 2024 revenues is pegged at $2.42 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 24.49%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 60 days.\n\nEstimate Revision Positive Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Liquidity Position\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s strong liquidity position is noteworthy. As of Mar 31, 2024, it had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.42 billion.\r\n\r\nFree cash flow was $176 million in the first quarter. \r\n\r\nThe strong liquidity position helps TTD to sustain its share buyback program. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company had $575 million available and authorized for repurchases.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s strong portfolio and expanding partner base are positive. The Growth Style Score of A is hard to ignore for investors.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Desk currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. However, investors who already own the stock might expect the company\u2019s growth prospects to be rewarding over a longer term.

        "title": "The Returns On Capital At Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) Don't Inspire Confidence",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Trade Desk:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.11 = US$252m \u00f7 (US$4.7b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Trade Desk has an ROCE of 11%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 11%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Trade Desk compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Trade Desk  for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Trade Desk Tell Us?\n\nOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Trade Desk doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 21% over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that Trade Desk has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 49%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile returns have fallen for Trade Desk in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 311% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're still interested in Trade Desk it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation for TTD to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this freelist of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 71% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Trade Desk's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 13 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Ownership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nEvery investor in The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 71% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Trade Desk, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Trade Desk?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nTrade Desk already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Trade Desk's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Trade Desk is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Jeffrey Green with 9.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.9% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Trade Desk\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in The Trade Desk, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$4.7b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Trade Desk. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "The Trade Desk, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TTD) Stock Is Rallying But Financials Look Ambiguous: Will The Momentum Continue?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Trade Desk's (NASDAQ:TTD) stock increased significantly by 18% over the past three months. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Specifically, we decided to study Trade Desk's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:\n\n9.3% = US$201m \u00f7 US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Trade Desk's Earnings Growth And 9.3% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Trade Desk's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 14%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. As a result, Trade Desk's flat net income growth over the past five years doesn't come as a surprise given its lower ROE.\n\nWe then compared Trade Desk's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 7.3% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Trade Desk's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Trade Desk Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nTrade Desk doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Trade Desk can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

        "title": "Why The Trade Desk (TTD) Outpaced the Stock Market Today",
        "content": "The latest trading session saw The Trade Desk (TTD) ending at $98.13, denoting a +0.43% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.09%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.3%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the digital-advertising platform operator had gained 2.37% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.38% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of The Trade Desk in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.36, signifying a 28.57% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $577.55 million, indicating a 24.41% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.57 per share and a revenue of $2.42 billion, representing changes of +24.6% and +24.49%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for The Trade Desk. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 2.9% increase. As of now, The Trade Desk holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, The Trade Desk is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 62.41. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.81.\n\nWe can also see that TTD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.71. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.15.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 162, this industry ranks in the bottom 36% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Trade Desk (TTD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "The Trade Desk (TTD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this digital-advertising platform operator have returned +2.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which The Trade Desk falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe Trade Desk is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.57 points to a change of +24.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.90 indicates a change of +21.1% from what The Trade Desk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, The Trade Desk is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TTD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of The Trade Desk, the consensus sales estimate of $577.55 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.4%. The $2.42 billion and $2.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +24.5% and +21.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nThe Trade Desk reported revenues of $491.25 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.3%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $480.03 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +18.18%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, The Trade Desk surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nThe Trade Desk is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Trade Desk. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Have $50K? 7 Stocks to Buy to Retire With $1 Million by 2034",
        "content": "If you are looking for millionaire-maker stocks to turn a $50,000 portfolio into $1 million in just a decade, I\u00a0would like\u00a0to remind you of several things. First, your portfolio would need to compound at around 35% annually. Even if most stocks in your portfolio outperform the broader market\u00a0going forward\u00a0and meet expectations, this is very ambitious. Even Warren Buffett\u2019s returns have been around 20% since he started,\u00a0and these returns\u00a0have been more in line with the market in the past decade.\n\nIn addition, $50k is a\u00a0pretty\u00a0large\u00a0sum for the average Joe.\u00a0If you want to 20x that in a decade with no additional contributions\u00a0along the way, the only stocks that could realistically do that are penny stocks. I do not recommend putting this much money into penny stocks.\n\nHowever, this\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean\u00a0that you\u2019re\u00a0out of\u00a0luck.\u00a0You can still buy some quality companies at premium valuations. And, as long as Wall Street holds up the premium valuation, they could return solid returns over the next decade.\u00a0Turning $50k to $1 million\u00a0is possible\u00a0if you periodically put more money into these millionaire-maker stocks and the stars align for them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) is a leading advertising technology company that enables advertisers\u00a0to efficiently target audiences across various digital platforms. In the first quarter, the company posted revenue up 28% year-over-year (YOY) to $491.25 million, beating estimates by $10.76 million.\u00a0This outperformance is caused by the ongoing shift towards programmatic advertising and the growing adoption of connected TV (CTV).\n\nAs\u00a0more viewers cut the cord and embrace streaming platforms, ad dollars are following suit.\u00a0The company\u2019s partnerships with major players like\u00a0Disney (NYSE:DIS), NBCU, and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) further solidify its position in the CTV space. Additionally, the increasing adoption of UID 2.0 is helping Trade Desk gain market share from walled gardens like Google and Facebook.\n\nWith analysts\u00a0projecting annual EPS growth of around 25% and sales growth of approximately 20% in the coming years, Trade Desk\u00a0has the potential to\u00a0deliver substantial returns for long-term investors. If the stock can maintain its premium valuation, it could\u00a0very well\u00a0turn a $50,000 investment into $1 million by 2034.\n\nStory continues\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) provides cloud-based software that helps companies manage digital workflows. The company is riding major tailwinds as enterprises race to automate processes and integrate artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0across their operations. In Q1, ServiceNow delivered outstanding results, with subscription revenue growing 24.5%. And, its closely watched current RPO metrics beat guidance.\n\nThe company\u2019s Generative AI offerings like NowAssist are already the fastest-selling product in\u00a0company\u00a0history.\n\nWhile the stock trades at a premium 55 times forward earnings multiple,\u00a0this valuation could stick around if ServiceNow sustains its current momentum.\u00a0With a rock-solid 98%+ renewal rate and\u00a0projected 20%+ revenue and EPS growth for years\u00a0to come, ServiceNow appears well-positioned to do just that.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) operates\u00a0the\u00a0leading e-commerce and digital payments platform\u00a0in Latin America.\u00a0This company is riding\u00a0powerful\u00a0megatrends that could propel the stock much higher over the next decade.\u00a0MercadoLibre is\u00a0essentially\u00a0becoming the Amazon of Latin America. Absolutely, it dominates online retail in a region with a rapidly growing middle class and accelerating internet adoption.\n\nWhile the fintech segment has hit some speed bumps lately due to macro headwinds like high interest rates and softening consumer demand, MercadoLibre\u2019s core e-commerce business continues to fire on all cylinders with no signs of cracking. For example, Brazil and Mexico\u00a0posted stellar 30% GMV growth in Q1. Also, the fintech segment has been doing just fine if you zoom out. millionaire-maker stocks: Mercado Libre segments growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFurthermore, despite challenges in Argentina, MercadoLibre still delivered robust top and bottom-line growth in the quarter. Analysts see EPS skyrocketing\u00a0from $34 in 2024 to $245 by 2033. While a 20x return is a tall order, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see MercadoLibre delivering market-crushing gains.\n\nDexCom (DXCM) Dexcom (DXCM) logo on an app store page on a mobile phone\n\nSource: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com\n\nDexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) develops and manufactures continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetes management.\u00a0The company is riding several\u00a0powerful\u00a0megatrends and tailwinds that could propel its stock to massive gains by 2034.\n\nFirst and foremost, companies in the diabetes treatment space are seeing their revenues and profits surge. With obesity rates remaining stubbornly high and sedentary lifestyles becoming more prevalent, the unfortunate reality is that diabetes cases will likely continue rising for the foreseeable future.\u00a0This\u00a0provides a\u00a0major\u00a0tailwind for DexCom.\n\nAlso, the company posted stellar growth, with\u00a0revenue growing 24%\u00a0year-over-year (YOY) to $921 million.\u00a0In addition, DexCom handily beat expectations on the bottom line, posting EPS of 32 cents versus the 27 cents consensus estimate.\n\nSo, although shares have languished in the near term,\u00a0DXCM remains a good\u00a0long-term bet.\u00a0Plus, its EPS\u00a0is\u00a0expected\u00a0to more than double in the next four years.\n\nSafran (SAFRY) An image of a futuristic aerospace engine rendering\n\nSource: solarseven / Shutterstock\n\nSafran (OTCMKTS:SAFRY) provides aerospace and defense products and services. The aviation industry has been soaring\u00a0in recent years, fueled by tax cuts that allowed business jet write-offs. While the pandemic temporarily grounded the sector, it\u2019s now roaring back with a vengeance. I\u2019m not talking about debt-laden airlines, though. I\u2019m referring to the real winners: aviation manufacturing and software giants like Safran.\n\nThis French powerhouse is posting stellar results, with\u00a0Q1 revenue growing 18% to 6.2 billion euros. Double-digit growth across all divisions\u00a0was driven\u00a0by a 27% jump in civil aftermarket sales. Despite a soft start to aircraft production, Safran\u00a0still\u00a0expects 10-15% growth in LEAP engine deliveries for 2024.\n\nThe real kicker? Safran trades at a mere seven times forward earnings with a juicy 1% dividend yield\u00a0to boot. As air traffic recovers (narrow body at 113% of 2019 levels, wide body at 94%), Safran is perfectly positioned to ride the aviation megatrend to new heights.

While multibagger returns by 2034 would require cooperation from the broader Chinese market, Meituan\u2019s stock has\u00a0already nearly\u00a0doubled off January lows.\u00a0If it can sustain high-profit growth,\u00a0this rebound is just\u00a0getting started.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs.

The company posted\u00a019% subscription revenue growth in Q1.\n\nHowever, investors must weigh the risks. The rise of AI could be a double-edged sword. While it may drive more companies to adopt Workday\u2019s automation tools,\u00a0it could also lead to significant headcount reductions that shrink Workday\u2019s addressable market. Additionally, with the stock\u2019s muted performance in recent years, a 20x return by 2034, while not impossible, would require a near-perfect execution.\u00a0Nevertheless,\u00a0I still think\u00a0it is a good candidate since it has strong tailwinds, and analysts expect solid growth going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Long term investing can be life changing when you buy and hold the truly great businesses. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. For example, the The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) share price is up a whopping 329% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. It's also good to see the share price up 15% over the last quarter.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Trade Desk achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 34% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 237.45.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Trade Desk has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Trade Desk will grow revenue in the future.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nTrade Desk shareholders have received returns of 28% over twelve months, which isn't far from the general market return. We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 34% per year. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Trade Desk a stock worth watching. If you would like to research Trade Desk in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.\n\nOf course Trade Desk may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of growth stocks.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Here's What's Concerning About Trade Desk's (NASDAQ:TTD) Returns On Capital",
        "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Trade Desk, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.11 = US$252m \u00f7 (US$4.7b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Trade Desk has an ROCE of 11%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 11%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Trade Desk compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Trade Desk .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Trade Desk Tell Us?\n\nIn terms of Trade Desk's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 21%, but since then they've fallen to 11%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.\n\nOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that Trade Desk has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 49%, which we'd consider pretty high. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Trade Desk. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 308% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrade Desk could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation for TTD on our platform quite valuable.\n\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this freelist of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Nvidia has been the talk of the town since generative artificial intelligence (AI) burst onto the scene last year with the advent of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Since then, nearly every tech titan has laid down plans to develop its own version of ChatGPT or other generative AI service.\n\nBut investing in Nvidia or even one of the tech giants isn't the only way to play the AI trend. There are many smaller, niche companies that are starting to disrupt traditional models in every industry. The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), Lemonade(NYSE: LMND), and Pagaya Technologies(NASDAQ: PGY) are three AI-driven stocks that could go parabolic.\n\n1. The Trade Desk: Simplifying advertising\n\nAI may be the most exciting and hyped trend on the market right now, but it's not the only one. Advertising is also making a splash these days as it intersects with new technology. The Trade Desk brings all of these trends together in an incredible, high-growth platform.\n\nThe Trade Desk's business is simple, yet powerful. It provides an AI-powered marketplace connecting ad buyers and publishers. It calls itself \"an enabler, not a disruptor.\"\n\nThat's the bare bones of it, which highlights why its formula is so potent. It harnesses the power of AI to take care of what is otherwise a complex, multistep process and distills it into an easy-to-use system that gets real results.\n\nIts buyers include players like ad agencies and direct advertisers, and its publishers comprise the gamut of sellers from print to social media and streaming. It's a digital enterprise that uses technology to transact, even when the publisher isn't a digital medium, like a print newspaper.\n\nAI is an important piece of the model because The Trade Desk uses a vast trove of data to help place ads in the most results-driven places, which it can determine in seconds. It also provides very detailed reporting, with 200 performance measures and 300 measurable variables.\n\nThe Trade Desk has demonstrated robust growth and increasing profit. Revenue increased 23% year over year in 2023, despite the pinch of inflation. Plus, it's still in the early innings of its game and has a $900 billion opportunity in global ad spend. As advertising shifts through technology, the company has years of growth ahead.\n\n2. Lemonade: Disrupting insurance\n\nLemonade most definitely calls itself a disruptor. It was created to shake up the insurance industry and offer an improved experience to legacy operators. Insurance is an industry ripe for AI disruption since it's all based on data and still functions much the way it did a century ago (and longer).\n\nStory continues\n\nLemonade works differently in a few ways. It onboards customers through chatbots and approves claims digitally, often in seconds. It's a registered B-corp and gives policyholders the option to donate any remaining funds to charity.\n\nMost importantly, it was built on a digital substrate and is made to manage a multiprocess system. Its infrastructure connects all of the pieces so they flow together seamlessly, rather than rely on human intervention to move the process from one step to the next. For customers, that results in faster service that's mostly digital.\n\nIt also expects its models to become more accurate over time -- so much more accurate that it catches up to and eventually surpasses legacy models. That hasn't happened yet for a number of reasons, most significantly that it's just very young and doesn't have the decades of data that older companies do. It also factors in its own high expenses into its profitability algorithms, and since it's still in rollout mode, those are high.\n\nWhile many investors feel that Lemonade is taking too long to show progress, management is confident in its AI-powerered model and how it will change insurance. So far, it's proving popular with its target demographic of young customers.\n\nCustomer count increased 12% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and average premium per customer increased 7%. That's the result of Lemonade's upselling and cross-selling strategy. The company's stock could be risky right now, but if and when Lemonade's progress accelerates, its stock could skyrocket.\n\n3. Pagaya: A better credit evaluation model\n\nPagaya operates an AI-driven credit evaluation platform that helps banks and financial institutions more accurately identify and minimize risk while opening up more opportunities for effective lending. It works with many top brands and has a strong pipeline of new clients that it regularly onboards.\n\nThe company recently partnered with U.S. Bank and has six large lenders lined up to join the platform. It's also in talks with other top banks that could generate years of high growth.\n\nA key part of its model is that it sells the loans it approves to institutional lenders as asset-backed securities (ABS). It obtains funding for its loans from the lenders before it makes them, providing plenty of liquidity and opportunity.\n\nPagaya has been reporting phenomenal growth, which is especially impressive considering the high interest rates that have crushed many lending companies. Revenue and network volume were both up 31% in the 2024 first quarter, and the company raised $1.9 billion in funding including from 18 new sources in its funnel.\n\nPagaya isn't profitable yet, but it's moving in the right direction. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in the first quarter compared with a loss last year in the same period, and management raised its projection for adjusted EBITDA by $10 million after some cost-efficiency actions.\n\nPagaya isn't a stock for the risk-averse, but it has loads of potential and could be a candidate for an excellent high-growth opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Digital Advertising Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Today, we discuss three of the most undervalued digital advertising stocks to consider in the second half 2024. The digital advertising landscape continues its relentless expansion. As consumers spend more time glued to their screens, brands fiercely compete for attention across websites, social media platforms and mobile apps. This has fueled a surge in digital ad spending, with Statista projecting it to reach a staggering $870 billion globally in 2027.\n\nFor investors seeking a slice of this growing pie, the challenge lies in identifying undervalued opportunities. While established giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0and Meta (NASDAQ:META) dominate the market, numerous smaller players are also carving out their niches. These companies are capitalizing on emerging trends and thus offering investors the potential for substantial returns. In this article, we\u2019ll explore three undervalued digital advertising stocks for your June 2024 portfolio.\n\nMagnite (MGNI) trade desk stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFirst on our list of most undervalued digital advertising stocks is Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI). The company operates a notable independent sell-side advertising platform, connecting publishers with advertisers. Additionally, it offers advertisers access to premium ad space across the web, mobile apps, Connected TV (CTV) and audio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMagnite reported robust results for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year (YOY) to $149.3 million. Net income surged 38.8% to $7.98 million, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 25% to 5 cents. The CTV segment stood out, with contributions excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (ex-TAC) growing 18% YOY to $55 million.\n\nInvestors were pleased when Magnite announced a deal with Mediaocean, a platform for omnichannel advertising. This partnership aims to streamline CTV and Online Video (OLV) ad buying for Mediaocean\u2019s Prisma platform users. As a result, this exclusive partnership leverages Magnite\u2019s ClearLine solution to provide Prisma buyers with direct access to premium video sellers\u2019 inventory.\n\nSo far, in 2024, MGNI stock has surged more than 40%. Yet, shares are reasonably valued at 13.2x forward earnings and 2.8x sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $16 for MGNI, signaling a 22% upside.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext, we discuss Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as one of today\u2019s most undervalued digital advertising platforms. The company offers popular hardware devices that enable users to access a vast library of streaming services. Beyond hardware, Roku operates its own Roku Channel, featuring a curated selection of free and ad-supported content. This dual approach allows the company to capture revenue from device sales and advertising on its platform. Furthermore, Roku leverages user data to provide targeted advertising solutions, generating an additional revenue stream.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoku\u2019s first quarter 2024 earnings report highlighted several key achievements. The company reported a 14% YOY increase in streaming households and a 23% rise in streaming hours. Platform revenue grew by 19% to $881 million. Meanwhile, net loss and net loss per share declined around 75% to $50.9 million and 35 cents, respectively.\n\nRoku and the advertising tech giant The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) have recently announced a strategic partnership to enhance TV streaming ad experiences. This collaboration empowers advertisers using The Trade Desk platform to leverage Roku\u2019s user data and audience insights.\n\nDespite these positive developments, ROKU stock has slumped 37% year-to-date (YTD) and is trading 2.3 times sales. Wall Street has a 12-month median price forecast of $74.30 for ROKU, suggesting a nearly 29% upside.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) graphic of laptop screens displaying ad space. advertising stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRounding out our discussion on the most undervalued digital advertising stocks is the digital advertising industry watchdog DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The company provides a software platform for digital media measurement, analytics, essential verification and brand safety solutions. DoubleVerify utilizes advanced technologies to detect and prevent ad fraud. Additionally, the company aims to safeguard brand reputations by filtering out inappropriate or unsuitable advertisement content placements.\n\nIn early May, DoubleVerify reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 20 in early May 24, surpassing analyst expectations. Total revenue grew 15% YOY to $140.8 million, driven by double-digit growth in activation and measurement solutions. Due to higher expenses, net income and diluted EPS dropped around 42% to $7.16 million and 4 cents, respectively. The company also highlighted strong growth ithe n social and international measurement revenue segments.\n\nDoubleVerify recently announced that it has secured Media Rating Council accreditation for video viewable impressions within the CTV space. This achievement strengthens DV\u2019s position as a leader in CTV measurement by ensuring data accuracy and transparency.\n\nYet, despite these developments, DV stock has plunged more than 50% YTD.\u00a0 As a result, the shares are trading at 33.9 times forward earnings and 5.5 times sales. Finally, analysts remain bullish, setting a 12-month price target of $31 for DV, signaling almost 70% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "With 71% institutional ownership, The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is a favorite amongst the big guns",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Trade Desk's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 13 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nEvery investor in The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 71% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Trade Desk, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Trade Desk?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nTrade Desk already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Trade Desk, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Trade Desk. The company's CEO Jeffrey Green is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.9% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 13 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Trade Desk\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in The Trade Desk, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$4.3b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Trade Desk. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Trade Desk better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in The Trade Desk (TTD): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about The Trade Desk (TTD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nThe Trade Desk currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.44, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.44 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 7.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for TTD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for TTD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for The Trade Desk here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying The Trade Desk, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs TTD a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for The Trade Desk, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.55.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Trade Desk. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for The Trade Desk.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The fact that multiple The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nTrade Desk Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Lead Independent Director, Lise Buyer, sold US$1.5m worth of shares at a price of US$75.20 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$97.19). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 16% of Lise Buyer's stake.\n\nTrade Desk insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Trade Desk better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Trade Desk\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Trade Desk insiders own 9.6% of the company, currently worth about US$4.5b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Trade Desk Insiders?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Trade Desk insiders selling. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREEreport showing analyst forecasts for Trade Desk.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course Trade Desk may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) provides high-performance server and storage solutions. The company is riding high on the AI revolution, delivering record-breaking results in Q3, with revenue surging 200% YOY to $3.85 billion and non-GAAP EPS skyrocketing 308% to $6.65.\n\nI believe the debate around an AI bubble is valid, but SMCI\u2019s fundamentals suggest it\u2019s a compelling buy in the space. The company is investing significantly in production, operations and liquid cooling technology to meet the soaring demand for its rack-scale AI solutions. Despite the stock\u2019s meteoric rise, SMCI trades at just 34 times forward earnings and three times sales, a bargain compared to many frothier AI plays. Growth Stocks: SMCI Revenue EPS\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI expect SMCI to handily double its sales and EPS over the next two years as it capitalizes on the AI megatrend. With a pristine balance sheet bolstered by a recent $3.28 billion capital raise, SMCI has the firepower to scale aggressively. For growth investors, I recommend accumulating shares on any dips, as this AI juggernaut is just getting started.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) operates a leading demand-side platform for digital advertising. I believe this is one of the highest-quality growth stocks you can buy and hold until 2030.\n\nIn Q1, revenue surged 28% YOY to $491 million, highlighting the rapid adoption of programmatic advertising. CEO Jeff Green noted that over 90% of the top 200 global advertisers have run campaigns on their platform in the last 12 months.\n\nCTV continues to be their fastest-growing channel as industry giants like Disney (NYSE:DIS), NBCU, and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) double down on streaming. The open internet is being replumbed and revalued, especially compared to walled gardens. Trade Desk\u2019s Kokai platform helps clients fully leverage data-driven buying to fuel their growth in this environment.\n\nWith the shift to digital advertising accelerating and the $1 trillion TAM up for grabs, I\u2019m incredibly bullish on Trade Desk\u2019s ability to outperform over the long run. The future looks very bright here, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a high-conviction growth stock, Trade Desk absolutely belongs in your portfolio.\n\nPinduoduo Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinduoduo Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) operates a leading e-commerce platform in China. I believe PDD is one of the most compelling growth stocks to buy and hold until 2030. In Q1, PDD\u2019s revenue surged an astounding 131% YOY to $11.99 billion, blowing away estimates by $1.41 billion.\n\nThis momentum is undeniable. PDD is a rare Chinese company that successfully brought its model to the U.S. through its Temu app, which has consistently ranked as the most downloaded shopping app. Temu is rapidly popularizing Chinese-style bargain e-commerce stateside.\n\nWhile most Chinese stocks have been shattered, PDD\u2019s international expansion gives it a major edge to keep compounding. Management\u2019s focus on supporting high-quality consumption, broadening supply, and promoting a robust ecosystem positions PDD for sustainable growth.\n\nYes, near-term challenges may arise as PDD invests heavily in the future. But I\u2019m confident its long-term orientation will handsomely reward patient investors. PDD\u2019s unique domestic dominance and international momentum mix make it a top pick. Analysts think it can cross $200 within the next 12 months. PDD price targets\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHarrow (HROW) Light blue pills on white background. Pharmaceutical industry, medical treatment, presciption drugs concept. Digital 3D render., biotech stocks, big pharma. EVAX stock\n\nSource: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nHarrow (NASDAQ:HROW) is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing ophthalmic drugs and technologies. The stock is a riskier bet than other growth stocks, with higher volatility. However, I believe Harrow\u2019s long-term prospects are compelling, supported by the increasing prevalence of eye problems in today\u2019s screen-obsessed world. Kids are growing up with screens glued to their hands, and while there\u2019s a lot of debate around why so many people have eye problems today, I think everyone can agree that screens are involved in some form. HROW stock seems like a solid way to benefit from this.\n\nThe company posted strong revenue growth of 33% YOY, reaching $34.6 million in Q1 2024. While Harrow missed EPS estimates by $0.17 with a loss of 38 cents, the launch of VEVYE, its flagship dry eye treatment, is showing promising early results. New prescriptions are ramping up month-over-month, and the company is now seeing its fifth refill cycle, which is where the true value lies for stockholders.\n\nHarrow is expected to turn profitable next year and significantly grow its profits, with the stock trading at just six times 2027 EPS estimates. HROW financial estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRevenue is projected to grow nearly 40% this year and double over the next six years. The stock has already recovered 50% year-to-date, and I believe it has further room to run.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the world\u2019s largest dedicated semiconductor foundry. Despite its impressive rise over the past few years, I believe TSM\u2019s valuation still doesn\u2019t fully reflect its critical role in the global semiconductor supply chain. In Q1 2024, TSM reported revenue of $18.23 billion, up 9.7% YOY, and EPS of $1.38, beating estimates by 6 cents. Advanced technologies (7nm and below) accounted for a whopping 65% of wafer revenue.\n\nWhile geopolitical risks surrounding Taiwan persist, I think the market overestimates their potential impact on TSM. Even if tensions escalate, TSM\u2019s global customer base and expanding U.S. presence provide a buffer. Plus, any disruption would likely hurt fabless chipmakers more than TSM itself. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone has nearly 4x the market cap of TSM right now, and this company won\u2019t function without Taiwan Semiconductor. I also expect Nvidia\u2019s pricing power to start extending into TSMC.\n\nChipmakers will also be able to source from TSM right in the U.S. once its factory in Arizona comes online.\n\nAppFolio (APPF) appfolio website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppFolio (NASDAQ:AAPF) provides cloud-based property management software solutions. Despite the waves of fear surrounding the real estate industry in recent years, I believe AppFolio is a great long-term investment with solid growth potential. In Q1 2024, AppFolio\u2019s revenue surged 38% YOY to $187 million. The company also improved margins, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 26% and a free cash flow margin of 22%. Plus, rising EPS should lead to even more appreciation in the coming quarters. Appf EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget: AppFolio has been beating EPS estimates significantly. APPF EPS beats\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAppFolio\u2019s differentiation lies in the company using AI to streamline processes like customer onboarding. This has resulted in customers completing data migrations 22% faster while maintaining a great experience. I believe the real estate industry is unlikely to face a massive crash due to limited housing supply and smaller family units. As interest rates eventually come down, demand for houses should accelerate. And I haven\u2019t even talked about the additional demand from legal and illegal migration. Real estate will keep growing in the long run, and so will AppFolio. Definitely one of the growth stocks that could perform well through 2030.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Be the Next Nvidia",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has capitalized on the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology like no other company, grabbing an almost monopolistic position in the booming market for AI chips and witnessing phenomenal growth in its revenue and earnings that has been rewarded handsomely by the market.\n\nShares of the graphics card specialist have shot up 115% in 2024 as of this writing. More importantly, Nvidia's rally seems here to stay, as the company's latest results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 tell us. The company's dominant position in the AI chip market helped it crush Wall Street's expectations and deliver super guidance for the current quarter.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia's $28 billion revenue guidance for fiscal Q2 means that its revenue could double once again in the current quarter as compared to the year-ago period. The company is clocking such roaring growth because of its 90%-plus share of the AI chip market, as well as its terrific pricing power.\n\nBut are there any other stocks that may be able to replicate Nvidia's stunning AI-fueled stock market performance? Are there any other companies that could start dominating the markets they operate in like Nvidia does right now? Here are two possibilities.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nJust like Nvidia, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is a semiconductor company. However, it serves a different niche. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) can help train large language models (LLMs) because of their powerful parallel computing abilities that help perform a huge number of calculations simultaneously.\n\nBroadcom, meanwhile, designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which, as the name suggests, are manufactured for performing specific tasks. They do not perform general computing tasks that GPUs can execute. However, as ASICs are tailored for specific purposes, they are deemed to be more efficient and powerful for the tasks they are designed to perform.\n\nThe good news for Broadcom is that the demand for ASICs for tackling AI workloads is increasing at a healthy pace. Morgan Stanley forecasts that the demand for AI-focused ASICs could increase at an annual rate of 85% through 2027 and generate annual revenue of $30 billion at the end of the forecast period.\n\nBroadcom's 35% share of this market puts it in a solid position to make the most of this fast-growing opportunity. It is also worth noting that the chipmaker has already built a solid base of customers who are using its custom chips for AI applications. Meta Platforms, for instance, is expected to become a significant customer for Broadcom's custom AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan expects Meta to be a multibillion-dollar customer for Broadcom on an annual basis, and the good part is that it isn't the only major tech company in line to buy the latter's chips. Alphabet is another tech titan that's set to deploy Broadcom chips for AI workloads. Together, Alphabet and Meta are expected to deliver $9 billion worth of AI chip revenue for Broadcom in 2024, which would be triple last year's level.\n\nWhat's more, Broadcom is forecast to sell AI chips worth $10 billion to $12 billion this year. That number could keep heading higher in the future as the adoption of custom chips for AI increases. According to an estimate by Japanese investment bank Mizuho, Broadcom's AI-related revenue could spike to $20 billion in 2027.\n\nAnalysts are currently predicting Broadcom's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 15% for the next five years. However, don't be surprised to see it grow at a faster pace as its AI business gets better. With Broadcom stock currently trading at 29 times forward earnings, as compared to Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 43, investors can buy it at a relatively cheaper valuation right now.\n\nThat could turn out to be a smart move in the long run, as the market may reward Broadcom with a higher multiple thanks to its AI-fueled growth, which could lead to healthy stock price gains.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe adoption of AI in the digital advertising market is forecast to grow rapidly. By 2033, AI is predicted to account for $214 billion in annual spending in marketing, up from $20 billion last year, translating into an annual growth rate of 27%. The digital ad market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 14.5% through 2030, generating $1.04 trillion in annual revenue.\n\nTherefore, companies that are leveraging AI to capture a bigger share of the digital ad market should ideally grow at a faster pace than the industry. The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is one such name. The company's revenue increased 23% in 2023 to $1.95 billion, and it started the first quarter of 2024 with stronger year-over-year growth of 28% in revenue. That was an improvement over the 21% growth it clocked in the same period last year.\n\nFor comparison, the digital ad market grew 10.7% last year, and it is forecast to notch 13.2% growth in 2024. The Trade Desk's growth rate indicates that it is gaining more share of the lucrative market it operates in, and AI is playing an important role in this growth.\n\nThe company has been leveraging AI since 2018 to help advertisers buy the right ads and deliver them on the right platforms to ensure a stronger return on spending. It upgraded its AI tools last year with the launch of a new platform known as Kokai, claiming that it can process 13 million advertising impressions each second so that advertisers can \"buy the right ad impressions, at the right price, to reach the target audience at the best time.\"\n\nIt won't be surprising to see more advertisers turning to The Trade Desk's programmatic ad platform to help improve audience targeting and conversion and increase their returns on ad dollars spent. Not surprisingly, analysts are forecasting a nice acceleration in The Trade Desk's earnings growth. TTD EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThis potential improvement in The Trade Desk's earnings power because of its AI-focused ad tools could continue for a long time. Even though The Trade Desk doesn't dominate the digital ad market, it could become a bigger player, considering that it is taking share away from larger players.\n\nThe Trade Desk may or may not end up with Nvidia-like dominance in the digital ad market, but the stock could become a long-term winner thanks to AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. In this article, we decided to focus on Trade Desk's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:\n\n9.3% = US$201m \u00f7 US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nTrade Desk's Earnings Growth And 9.3% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Trade Desk's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Trade Desk over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Trade Desk's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 10% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Trade Desk's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Trade Desk Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nTrade Desk doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Trade Desk's performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

        "title": "3 Exceptional Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "Which are better: growth stocks or value stocks? By the numbers, there's a clear winner, at least in recent years. It's growth stocks, hands down.\n\nIn fact, over the last 10 years, the Vanguard Growth ETF significantly outperformed the Vanguard Value ETF, with an annualized return of 15.2% to 10.2%. VUG Total Return Level Chart\n\nWith that in mind, let's have a look at three growth stocks I think are poised to deliver excellent returns over the long run. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nFirst up is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). Shares of the company, which operates a cloud-based digital advertising platform, have more than doubled in value over the last 18 months.\n\nThe boom in the digital advertising market is to thank. Statista states that in 2023, the digital advertising market was over $600 billion. That figure is estimated to increase to above $870 billion by 2027. The evidence of this growth is all around you.\n\nTake streaming services, for example. After resisting investor calls for an ad-based subscription tier for years, Netflix embraced one -- Netflix's ad tier now has over 40 million monthly active subscribers. Similarly, Disney+ (NYSE:DIS), Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock now have ad tiers.\n\nThat's excellent news for The Trade Desk, whose platform allows advertisers to direct overall ad campaigns and place ads directly on streaming services. Indeed, The Trade Desk has already announced partnerships with Disney and Netflix.\n\nAs for growth, The Trade Desk is growing revenue by 28% year over year as of its most recent quarter (the three months ending March 31, 2024). So, for growth-oriented investors, The Trade Desk is a name to keep an eye on.\n\nVisa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V)operates one of the world's largest payment networks. The company leverages the scale of its network to yield enormous revenue and profits.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending March 31, 2024), Visa generated $8.8 billion in revenue and $4.7 billion in net income. In turn, the company returned over $3.8 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.\n\nWhat's more, over the last 10 years, Visa cumulatively reduced its overall shares outstanding by about 19%, roughly 2% each year.\n\nThat's great news for investors. As the number of shares outstanding decreases, all else being equal, the value of the remaining shares will increase, thanks to the law of supply and demand.\n\nFinally, Visa isn't just about shareholder returns. The company is still growing rapidly, thanks to its business model, which benefits from rising prices. Over the last decade, Visa averaged revenue growth of 11%, and analysts expect similar growth over the next two years as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nLast, but by no means least, is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). After taking a significant dip in 2022, Amazon's stock is once again riding high and near its all-time high.\n\nOne reason the company's stock is performing well is that its operations are firing on all cylinders.In fact,the company's immense e-commerce business is clearly running more efficiently than ever before. Consider this quote from the company's most recent earnings call:\n\n\"In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, ~60% of Prime members' orders arrived the same or next day.\"\n\nIn short, Amazon's massive investments in its fulfillment network -- made during the COVID pandemic -- are paying off. Customers are getting their orders faster than ever.\n\nMoreover, with those large e-commerce infrastructure projects in the rearview mirror, the company is generating more free cash flow than ever before. AMZN Free Cash Flow Per Share Chart\n\nGranted, management signaled that free cash flow will likely dip later this yearas the company invests heavily in upgrading its AI capabilities. However, investors shouldn't fret -- those investments are designed to bolster the market share of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing segment.\n\nFinally, turning to growth, Amazon's revenue continues to soar.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search The Trade Desk (TTD): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "The Trade Desk (TTD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this digital-advertising platform operator have returned +14.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which The Trade Desk falls in, has gained 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nThe Trade Desk is expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +23%. This estimate has changed +4.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.87 indicates a change of +20.6% from what The Trade Desk is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, The Trade Desk is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TTD _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of The Trade Desk, the consensus sales estimate of $576.95 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.3%. The $2.42 billion and $2.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +24.4% and +21.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nThe Trade Desk reported revenues of $491.25 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.3%. EPS of $0.26 for the same period compares with $0.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $480.03 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +18.18%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, The Trade Desk surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nThe Trade Desk is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about The Trade Desk. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Best of the Open Internet (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nNew Report Highlights the Rise of the Premium Internet and Includes a List of the Top 100 Open Internet Publishers as Valued by Advertisers\n\nVENTURA, Calif., May 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global advertising technology leader The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) today launched The Sellers and Publishers Report \u2013 a new biannual assessment of advertising trends on the open internet. According to data from The Trade Desk, which assesses more than 15 million advertising opportunities per second on the open internet, the leading 500 digital publishers account for approximately 50 percent of advertising revenue on the open internet. These publishers are highly valued by advertisers due to their focus on key factors such as advertising quality, viewability, reach, decisioning power and supply path efficiency.\n\nAccording to the report, consumers now spend 61 percent of their online time on the open internet, compared to 39 percent within Big Tech walled gardens. This represents a reversal since 2014, when the majority of online consumer time was spent within walled gardens. This shift is the result, in part, of the rapid advance in streaming TV and digital audio, which now collectively account for almost 5 hours of daily consumption for the average American.\n\n\"The open internet is at a tipping point. In 2022, Facebook and Google accounted for less than half of all digital advertising spending for the first time in a decade, a trend that accelerated in 2023. That comes as consumers now spend the majority of their time outside these Big Tech walled gardens \u2014 increasingly preferring the best of the open internet. This includes the latest Hollywood movies and popular TV shows, streaming audio, live sports, and trusted journalism,\" said Jeff Green, CEO and Founder of The Trade Desk, in introducing the report. \"Indeed, since 2019, daily consumption of connected TV (CTV) and digital audio content has doubled in the United States. Not only does this premium internet content command the majority of consumer attention, it is also highly engaging content, which is very attractive for advertisers.\"\n\nIn order to showcase the value of the very best of the open internet, the report showcases the leading 100 advertising publishers from around the world including streaming services, audio and podcast platforms, as well as popular news, lifestyle and sports destinations. The list was compiled based on a range of criteria important to advertisers, and was conducted in partnership with Sincera, a leading digital advertising data company.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo read The Sellers and Publishers Report: The Rise of the Premium Internet and view the Best of the Open Internet list, please visit The Trade Desk website here.\n\nAbout The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2122 is a technology company that empowers buyers of advertising.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Palantir 2 Years From Now",
        "content": "Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has been a divisive stock ever since it went public via a direct listing in September 2020. The bulls were initially impressed by the data mining firm's robust growth, the stickiness of its government contracts, and the growth potential of its commercial business. Its ability to aggregate data from disparate sources to help its clients make smarter data-driven decisions also made it a promising play on the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nPalantir's stock has more than doubled from its opening price of $10, but it remains nearly 50% below its all-time high. Its revenue increased 41% in 2021, but grew just 24% in 2022 and 17% in 2023. That deceleration -- which missed its own goal for at least 30% growth through 2025 -- made it an easy target for the bears as interest rates rose. It mainly attributed that slowdown to choppy government spending and other macro headwinds. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir's revenue is stabilizing, and its profits are rising, but it's still worth $46.6 billion -- which gives it a frothy valuation of 17 times this year's sales.\n\nThere are two less valuable tech stocks -- Zscaler(NASDAQ: ZS) and The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) -- that have the potential to eclipse Palantir's current market capitalization in just two years.\n\n1. Zscaler\n\nZscaler, which has a market cap of $26.5 billion today, provides \"zero trust\" services, which treat everyone -- including a company's CEO -- as a potential threat. Unlike many other cybersecurity companies that install on-site appliances, Zscaler only provides its tools as a cloud-native service, which is stickier, cheaper, and easier to scale.\n\nFrom fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July), its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 55% as companies scrambled to upgrade their internal defenses. Like many other cloud-based cybersecurity companies, Zscaler faced a slowdown over the past year as the macro headwinds made it harder to lock large customers into longer-lasting contracts. But during its latest conference call in February, CEO Jay Chaudhry said it wasn't experiencing any \"significant pressure\" on its big deals, and that zero trust remained a \"top priority\" for many industries.\n\nAnalysts expect Zscaler's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 27% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as it overcomes those near-term challenges. Assuming it still trades at 12.5 times its trailing sales by the end of fiscal 2026, its market cap could reach $41 billion. If it's trading at a more generous 15 times sales, it would be worth nearly $50 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nZscaler isn't profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis yet, but it occupies a more defensible niche than Palantir, it's growing faster, and it's still trading at lower valuations than the data mining company.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk, which is worth $42.8 billion, owns the world's largest independent demand-side platform (DSP) for digital ads. DSPs help advertisers automatically purchase ad space across a wide range of platforms -- including desktop PCs, mobile devices, and streaming video services. They sit on the opposite end of the supply chain as sell-side platforms (SSPs), which help publishers sell their own ad inventories.\n\nTech giants like Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms bundle together DSPs, SSPs, and other advertising tools, but they usually lock advertisers and publishers into their walled gardens. To tear down those walls, many companies are turning to independent DSPs like The Trade Desk to reach the \"open internet\" of other websites, apps, and streaming video services.\n\nThe Trade Desk's revenue grew at a CAGR of 33% from 2020 to 2023, even as the broader advertising market grappled with the pandemic, inflation, geopolitical conflicts, and rising rates. Most of that growth was driven by the rapid expansion of ad-supported streaming video platforms. Its usage of first-party data and AI-driven ad placements also helped its clients deal with Apple's restrictions on third-party data across iOS devices.\n\nAnalysts expect The Trade Desk's revenue to continue growing at a CAGR of 22% from 2023 to 2026. If it's still trading at 17.5 times sales by then, it would be worth over $60 billion by the end of 2026. The Trade Desk might initially seem as pricey as Palantir, but the ad tech leader is growing faster than the data mining company and boasts clearer competitive advantages.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index is at an all-time high after April\u2019s inflation rate came in weaker than expected and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured markets that further interest rate hikes are unlikely. The Nasdaq is now hovering near 16,700, a pretty high level. The index of primarily technology stocks has risen 12% so far this year and is up 48% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe Nasdaq had been marching higher to start the month of May, but really took off after data showed that inflation rose 0.3% in April from March, less than the 0.4% that economists had expected. On an annualized basis, inflation in America increased 3.4%, matching forecasts.\n\nThe latest inflation data has caused relief and sent the Nasdaq higher, as investors bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off on any further interest rate hikes and may lower rates starting this September.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are Wall Street favorites: three Nasdaq stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have been riding high, ever since the maker of USB flash drives announced its most recent financial results. Year-to-date, MU stock is up 55%, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nOver the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has nearly doubled, having increased by about 97%. Despite the big rally, analysts see more runway ahead for Micron Technology.\n\nProfessional analysts currently have a consensus strong buy rating on MU stock, with a median price target of $135 per share. That\u2019s 6% higher than where Micron stock currently trades.\n\nAnalysts continue to expect that Micron will benefit from the AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products on the rise. Micron provides memory and flash storage for computers, data centers and cell phones.\n\nMicron next reports earnings on June 26.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is another top performing Nasdaq component, having risen about 147% in the last 12 months, including about 37% gain so far in 2024.\n\nCRWD stock jumped 23% higher after the cybersecurity firm reported its latest earnings, handily beating Wall Street estimates and raising its forward guidance. Analysts see CrowdStrike as one of the best ways to play the boom in cybersecurity.\n\nA total of 37 analysts rate CRWD stock a strong buy with a median price target of $398, 16% above current levels. Analysts continue to applaud the strong earnings growth at CrowdStrike and also like management\u2019s stated goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030. With demand for cybersecurity services steadily rising among corporations, governments and individuals, CrowdStrike is well-positioned to capitalize.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s next earnings print will be delivered on June 4.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline advertising has strengthened this year, and that has analysts singing the praises of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). The 19 analysts covering the company have a consensus strong buy rating on TTD stock, along with a median price of $101.71, which is 17% higher than where the share price is at right now.\n\nAnalysts expect The Trade Desk\u2019s sales and profits to accelerate along with online ad spending in coming months.\n\nThe company, which specializes in technologies that facilitate digital advertising, just reported earnings that crushed Wall Street estimates as growth on internet-connected televisions stormed back. The Trade Desk\u2019s profit rose 13% from a year earlier, while its sales were 28% higher year over year. For the current second quarter, The Trade Desk said that it expects revenue of $575 million, topping estimates of $567 million.\n\nTTD stock is up 24% on the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced Wednesday that it will team up with The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Display&Video 360, and ad-tech firm Magnite to accelerate automated ad buying. The company also made several other announcements as part of its Upfront 2024 press release.\n\nHere's how Wall Street analysts reacted:\n\nBMO Capital: \"Reiterate Outperform for TTD, our top SMID-cap pick, as a Netflix CTV demand partnership reinforces our view that TTD is best-positioned against a massive $150B linear TV opportunity shift towards connected TV.\"\n\nTruist: \"These partnerships were bound to happen in our view given Netflix's evolving ad platform, which is now at the point where it can scale materially with the scaling of users for its AVOD service.\"\n\nKeyBanc: \"As Netflix deepens its ad capabilities, we believe this could help support >10% annual revenue growth in 2025E and beyond.\"\n\nJPMorgan: \"NFLX announced that it will build an in-house ad tech platform by the end of 2025&expand its sales partnerships this summer to TTD, Google's Display&Video 360,&Magnite, in addition to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xandr. We believe today's announcements show solid progress in the multi-year journey toward a scaled advertising tier,&highlight NFLX\u02d6s growing focus on differentiated live content.\"\n\nCiti: \"Netflix broadening its ad tech partners has been anticipated for some time, and with TTD's leadership in decisioned programmatic CTV, it was a clear partner choice. That said, with Netflix's premier positioning in CTV, our view is this is positive for TTD.\"\n\nJefferies: \"NFLX's decision to onboard new programmatic partners (e.g., TTD, GOOG, MGNI) represents a faster-than-expected transition of Connected TV ad sales from direct deals into biddable auctions. We believe this validates our view that there will be fewer Walled Gardens in CTV than there are in Search/Social.\"\n\nUBS: \"Along with the recent WWE deal, we believe the addition of NFL rights provide another lever to drive engagement, enhance pricing power and scale the company's ad business (while presenting another source of leakage for marquee programming out the traditional TV ecosystem).\"\n\nGuggenheim: \"Netflix will stream at least one NFL game globally on Christmas Day for the next three years, the streaming giant announced Wednesday, marking the company's biggest bet on live sports yet.\"\n\n\"We estimate a cost of $200-250mm for NFLX's NFL rights and ~$185mm in direct advertising revenue.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley: \"For OW NFLX, the disclosure of 40mm ad-supported global monthly active users is in line with our forecast, an increase from 23mm reached in early January. This is broadly consistent with the +65% ad membership growth QoQ reported with 1Q24 results.\"\n\nPiper Sandler: \"Netflix announced it will be adding Trade Desk as a programmatic partner this summer. While Netflix's advertising business is still scaling, we think the partnership should be a significant long-term opportunity for Trade Desk.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHere's what 10 analysts have to say about Netflix ad tier\n\nDow briefly tops 40,000 for first time ever, but rising Treasury yields cap gains\n\nEarnings call: Zealand Pharma reports solid Q1 results, advances in obesity treatment\n\nView comments",

The stock pared gains after surging on Wednesday.\n\nDeere&Company (NYSE:DE) stock fell 3% after the maker of agricultural and construction machinery offered disappointing earnings guidance even after posting better-than-expected numbers for its fiscal second quarter.\n\nJD (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs rose 0.1% after the Chinese retailer beat expectations with its first-quarter revenue, as price cuts and discount coupons helped price-conscious customers.\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 4.9%, adding to recent gains,. It was added to analysts' top stocks list Thursday morning, which helped boost shares.\n\nThe Trade Desk Inc . (NASDAQ:TTD) rose 3.6% after Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) said it will launch an in-house ad tech platform and expand its partnership with Trade Desk and Magnite (MGNI).

        "title": "7 Explosive Tech Stocks Set to Dominate the Decade",
        "content": "Tech stocks and software companies have recovered substantially in the past few years and continue to climb upwards as Wall Street feels comfortable slapping a higher and higher premium on these stocks. The tech sector\u2019s resilience and growth potential have been the driving forces behind this bullish sentiment.\n\nOf course, we all know that the Big Tech companies have dominated and will likely continue to be the top dogs in the tech industry in the coming decade. However, it is worth peering at some other tech stocks performing very well and playing critical roles in specific industries. These tech stocks are set to dominate their sectors and continue growing in the coming decade as well. I believe many of them could deliver much higher returns than some big tech companies today.\n\nHere are seven tech stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s (NASDAQ:TTD) Q1 sales increased 28% year-over-year (YOY). The growth here is much higher than its peers. Its 3-year revenue growth is 31.6% and is better than 86% of software companies. Plus, it beat its Q1 sales estimates by 2.1%. TTD sales. tech stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith over 90% of the top 200 advertisers now working with them, it\u2019s clear the company could dominate the ad market in the coming years. Connected television continues to be a powerful driver of growth as streaming giants deepen their partnerships. However, the real game-changer is UID2, which is seeing a lot of adoption, combined with improved use of first-party customer information. This is rebuilding the internet\u2019s identity framework to The Trade Desk\u2019s advantage.\n\nI would note that the market is paying a huge premium here. The stock trades at 114 times forward earnings. However, I think this is a fair premium, given the growth.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) has started the new year off on the right foot, as its results surpassed expectations in several important areas. It beat EPS expectations by 43.7% and revenue expectations by a stellar 3.74%. The stock is up 43% in the past year, and the solid profits here have allowed it to yield 0.93% in dividends.\n\nThe number of hotel room nights booked through its website saw a nice 9% bump compared to the same time last year, fueled by the ongoing strong demand from leisure travelers looking to get away \u2014 a reassuring signal as the always-critical summer season is on the horizon. While near-term reservations may go up and down, I\u2019m encouraged by the company\u2019s focus on building customer loyalty and driving more bookings directly instead of through other sites.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, the ongoing political turbulence in the Middle East adds some uncertainty to what we may see over the next few months, with the potential to slow down that growth in hotel room bookings. The U.A.E, Israel, Turkey and Egypt are very popular tourist destinations. Still, I remain optimistic about where the company is heading in the long term.\n\nGoDaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoDaddy\u2019s (NYSE:GDDY) stellar results for the first quarter of 2024 show that pockets of strength within the business continue to show resilience. Bookings for the Applications and Commerce segment accelerated significantly, with a 22% increase. With insights from the GoDaddy Software Platform, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this positive momentum across its offerings persists as management works to optimize how the company\u2019s various solutions generate revenue.\n\nPeople mainly see this as a domain website. But what seems to be the true star, though, may be GoDaddy\u2019s growing commerce offerings. Annual gross payment volume surpassed $2 billion, propelled higher by increased transactions from existing customers. Since launching the flexible Smart Terminal device, GoDaddy appears well-positioned to benefit from omnichannel retail.\n\nThe stock still provides good value at 29 times forward earnings. With the disciplined expansion of profit margins by 4% and 26% percent higher free cash flow, it seems GDDY is executing well across all aspects of the business.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) continues to perform extremely well. With revenue increasing by 14.4% and EBITDA margins expanding by 60 basis points to 40.2%, it\u2019s clear why this stock has been so consistent and stable. It beat estimates on both lines and even pays a small dividend.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent $1.75 billion acquisition of Procare, a strategic addition to its early childhood education business, seems to be integrating smoothly and strengthening Roper\u2019s position in that field.\n\nFree cash flow for the quarter was also at $513 million, up 15% YOY. This level of cash generation provides Roper with tremendous flexibility for further acquisitions.\n\nGuidance was increased across the board, including an 8% to 10% outlook for organic revenue growth. ROP growth. tech stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAt this rate, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Roper continues its decades-long track record of consistent returns. It\u2019s definitely one of the tech stocks to buy.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have good reason to feel optimistic about CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR). Its Q1 2024 results exceeded expectations on the sales front by nearly 3.9%. EPS also significantly outperformed with 75 cents, beating estimates by 48 cents. Subscription revenue soared 54% YOY to $621 million.\n\nEven more promising, operations have become much more efficient. Non-GAAP operating income flipped from a $12.6 million loss to a $33 million profit. That shows a strong business model. Free cash flow was a healthy $67 million, too, up from just $4 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nManagement significantly revised guidance higher for the full year. Given over 90% of companies face identity breaches, CyberArk sits at the front of this crucial market with its unique platform. While the valuation is high now, the durable demand can\u2019t be overlooked. Should this growth and expanding margins continue, I remain very bullish for the long run.\n\nAnalysts expect EPS to rise from $2 to $4.5 in the next two years and revenue to grow from $935 million to $1.4 billion. The stock is up 69% in the past year. The upside potential looks juicy as well.

The company has a huge market share across mid-sized websites. It provides cybersecurity, SEO and other related solutions all under one platform at much cheaper prices than if these websites were to have their own cybersecurity team.\n\nIts Q1 revenue increased by 30.5%, and growth in large customers is accelerating. The company is making solid progress in serving more enterprises. Revenue growth from large customers came in at 67%, and it reported a record number of accounts with over $1 million added. The company also has a very robust 115% net retention rate.

It isn\u2019t very profitable right now, but analysts expect EPS to rise from 61 cents to $9.75 from 2024 to 2033. Revenue is expected to rise from $1.7 billion to $14.6 billion in the same timeframe.\n\nAvePoint (AVPT) In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) products\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is a lot to digest when reviewing AvePoint\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVPT) performance in the first quarter. The company is a software vendor of SaaS solutions that migrates, manages and protects data in Microsoft 365. On the one hand, the company greatly surpassed expectations, with revenue increasing 25% YOY to $74.5 million and non-GAAP operating margins that went beyond the initial guidance. This higher-than-predicted revenue was fueled by strong demand for its data organization and security solutions as organizations prepare for AI integration.\n\nPersonally, I am cautiously optimistic. The opportunities that AI brings are immense, but risks remain for newer players in such a fast-moving space. Its success depends a lot on the success of generative AI and what Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is betting on right now.\n\nEPS is still expected to almost double in the next two years, and revenue is growing at around 20% annually on average in the next five years. This gives me hope that the stock can capture a much higher premium in the years ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Here's My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Instead",
        "content": "There is no doubt that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy on the market in the past year-and-a-half thanks to the critical role it is playing in the advancement of this technology.\n\nAfter all, training large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without chips from Nvidia. Major cloud computing companies and governments around the globe have been lining up to buy Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs), leading to outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThere is a good chance that Nvidia will be able to sustain the impressive growth that it is posting in its top and bottom lines. That's because the company's dominant position in the AI chip market seems safe considering the technology lead that it enjoys over its rivals. However, there is a chance that investors who aren't comfortable paying for Nvidia's expensive valuation could be seeking alternatives to capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nNvidia is trading at 75 times trailing earnings. It may be able to justify that valuation by sustaining its red-hot growth, but for investors looking for a cheaper AI stock, The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) could turn out to be a top pick that could be an even better buy than Nvidia. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nThe Trade Desk is using AI to win market share in a lucrative niche\n\nThe Trade Desk provides a cloud-based, data-driven, programmatic advertising platform to advertisers. This platform allows them to purchase ad inventory from multiple channels, set up, run, and optimize ad campaigns, and serve ads to the right audience on the relevant platform in a cost-efficient manner to increase advertisers' return on investment.\n\nThe company uses real-time insights and algorithms to ensure that advertisers using its platform can get the most out of their ad dollars. More importantly, The Trade Desk has been leveraging AI to ensure that advertisers get more out of its platform. In 2018, the company launched and started integrating an AI tool known as Koa into its platform. Koa analyzed almost 9 million queries each second \"to help buyers extend audience reach and spend more efficiently.\"\n\nMore specifically, The Trade Desk claimed that Koa can help advertisers increase their reach by 3 times and reduce costs by 20%. The company released a new AI tool called Kokai last year, utilizing 13 million advertising impressions each second to \"help advertisers buy the right ad impressions, at the right price, to reach the target audience at the best time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch AI-enabled tools are helping The Trade Desk grow at a faster pace than the digital advertising market, and accelerate its growth. For instance, in 2023, the company's revenue increased 23% to $1.95 billion. That was well ahead of the 10.7% growth in digital ad spending last year. More importantly, The Trade Desk's latest results for the first quarter of 2024 suggest that it is winning a bigger share of the digital ad market as its growth is accelerating.\n\nThe company reported a 28% year-over-year jump in revenue last quarter to $491 million, a nice increase from the 21% year-over-year growth it clocked in the same period last year. The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin also increased by five percentage points from the year-ago period.\n\nThe Trade Desk's earnings of $0.26 per share beat the consensus estimate of $0.22 per share. Its revenue was also higher than the expectation of $480 million. Even better, The Trade Desk's revenue guidance of $575 million is higher than the Wall Street forecast of $567 million. The EBITDA forecast of $223 million has also exceeded the $219 million consensus expectation.\n\nThe company's quarterly revenue forecast would translate into a jump of 23% from the year-ago quarter, while its adjusted EBITDA is on track to increase by a similar figure. It is also worth noting that digital ad spending is estimated to increase by 13.2% in 2024, and the Trade Desk's Q1 growth and Q2 guidance suggest that it is set to grow at a faster pace than the market once again.\n\nSo, The Trade Desk's strategy of using AI to power its programmatic ad platform is set to help it capture a bigger share of the digital ad market. This should bode well for the company's long-term growth. That's because the digital ad market is forecast to generate $1.15 trillion in annual revenue in 2030, up from $420 billion last year, as per Grand View Research.\n\nThe Trade Desk, therefore, has a massive addressable opportunity ahead of it, and the fact that it is gaining ground in the digital ad market explains why analysts have been increasing their growth expectations for the company. TTD Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nTTD Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nInvestors can expect the stock to deliver healthy gains\n\nThe Trade Desk stock is currently trading at 21 times sales, a small discount to its five-year average sales multiple of almost 24. Of course, the sales multiple is higher than the U.S. tech sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7, but The Trade Desk's growing stature in the digital ad market could justify it.\n\nIf the Trade Desk can maintain its current sales multiple after three years and achieves $3.52 billion in revenue in 2026, as per the chart in the previous paragraph, its market cap could increase to $74 billion. That points toward a jump of 72% from the current level.\n\nAlso, The Trade Desk is cheaper than Nvidia, which commands a sales multiple of 36. So, investors looking for a relatively cheaper alternative to Nvidia can consider buying The Trade Desk, as it could turn out to be a top AI stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Although the innovation space seemingly can\u2019t do any wrong, investors may be best served with tech stocks to buy that also enjoy strong endorsements from Wall Street analysts. They don\u2019t make or break enterprises but their blessings carry much weight.\n\nFor one thing, analysts do this for a living. Further, the big Wall Street firms don\u2019t just pick random folks (or NPCs to use the common lexicon) to represent their brands. No, they have to earn their way into the field. And that means you\u2019re not going to find too many kooky ideas out there.\n\nPlus, many experts may influence the market because of their prominence and reputation. Therefore, you can approach these tech stock to buy with a greater degree of confidence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in its namesake nation, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), along with its subsidiaries manufacturers, packages, tests and sells integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor devices. Further, the company provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including mixed signal and radio frequency solutions. Bottom line, it\u2019s a critical component of the global tech ecosystem, which is why analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy.\n\nTo be fair, the tech giant \u2013 often abbreviated as TSMC \u2013 is a known commodity. Therefore, experts\u2019 average price target on the security is only $164.13, implying about 8% upside potential. Further, with a trailing-year revenue multiple of 11.39X, shares trade at a premium. Still, the company has a strong financial track record. Over the past four quarters since the first quarter of 2024, its average positive earnings surprise comes out to 6.55%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts project revenue to reach $84.61 billion, up 21.9% from last year\u2019s haul of $69.4 billion. In fiscal 2025, this metric could rise to $102.79 billion, up 21.5% from projected 2024 sales. Therefore, it makes a solid case for tech stocks to buy.\n\nShift4Payments (FOUR) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Center Valley, Pennsylvania, Shift4Payments (NYSE:FOUR) operates in the infrastructure software category. Per its public profile, the company provides software and payment processing solutions in the U.S. and international markets. It offers a payment platform, specifically an omnichannel card acceptance and processing system that covers multiple payment types. Such flexibility is increasingly relevant in the digitalized commerce space.\n\nUnsurprisingly, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with an $87.41 average price target. That implies more than 34% upside potential. Further, the high-side target calls for a price of $104 per share. To be fair, the company\u2019s last two earnings performances came in below the expected mark. However, from Q2 2023 to Q1 2024, the average positive surprise landed at 10.23%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s really intriguing is that shares trade at 1.52X trailing-year revenue. That\u2019s lower than the sector median 2.26X. Additionally, the metric could be even more favorable considering that fiscal 2024 sales are projected to reach $3.63 billion. If so, that would be up 41.6% higher than last year\u2019s print of $2.56 billion. Thus, it makes a great case for tech stocks to buy.\n\nTrade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those that want to dial up the risk-reward factor, you have Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). Based in Ventura, California, Trade Desk is an application software entity. According to its corporate profile, the tech firm operates as a self-service cloud-based platform, allowing buyers to plan, manage, optimize and measure data-driven digital advertising campaigns. With the huge pivot toward streaming content, Trade Desk could be exceptionally compelling.\n\nAnalysts understandably agree, rating shares a consensus strong buy. Further, the average price target comes in at $101.71, implying 18% upside potential. The high-side target stands at $115, projecting over 33% growth potential. However, prospective investors should note that there is one sell rating within the past three months.\n\nOverall, the financial profile of Trade Desk is encouraging. Aside from one small miss in Q4, it\u2019s been lights out. Over the past four quarters since Q1 2024, the average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 10.15%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe revenue could soar to $2.41 billion. If so, that would be up 23.7% from last year\u2019s result of $1.95 billion. It\u2019s one of the tech stocks to buy for risk takers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Buying stocks in great companies and holding them for the long term is a recipe for investing success. The challenge is knowing what to buy and how to allocate the capital one has for investing. Luckily, many online brokerages offer fractional share purchases, which allows investors to buy parts of a share. This makes buying stocks that have a higher per-share price easier.\n\nIf you have $5,000 and are interested in tech stocks, here are three companies to consider. Each of these businesses has strong fundamentals and bright futures. There could be some volatility in the short term, but over the long haul, each has the potential to reward shareholders.\n\nConfluent\n\nSome of the best stock picks in the tech sector are companies that offer their products to other businesses, making them less well-known to everyday investors. Confluent(NASDAQ: CFLT) is one such business. Confluent sells software that helps businesses access important data in real time, allowing them to make critical decisions more quickly.\n\nIn the recently reported first quarter of 2024, Confluent grew its total customer count by 9% year over year. However, its number of largest customers grew more rapidly. Customers with $100,000 or more in annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew by 17%, and those with $1 million or more in ARR increased by 24%. Larger customer growth outpacing overall customer growth is a good sign for Confluent.\n\nWhile not yet profitable, Confluent is making good progress on that front. In Q1 of 2024, Confluent's net loss was $93 million, as compared to a loss of $153 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDatadog\n\nAnother business-to-business software provider that should be on investors' radar is Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG). Its observability and security platform allows companies to see all the data they need to run the business in one place, removing silos and helping workflow. Datadog's products have certainly proved to be valuable. Almost half of its customers use four or more products, and around a quarter of them use six or more.\n\nThis customer adoption has driven impressive revenue growth.\n\nIn Q1 of 2021, Datadog had $199 million in revenue. In Q1 of 2024, revenue was reported at $611 million. Datadog has turned profitable over the past year. Q1 2024 net income was $43 million, compared to a net loss of $24 million in Q1 of 2023. The cash flow statement has also improved, with the company generating a free cash flow margin of 31% in the most recent quarter, compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nAll investors likely know someone who subscribes to one or more streaming services by now. This move to streaming allows advertisements to be more targeted to the specific person watching, providing a higher return on investment for the advertiser. The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is the most important company in facilitating the placement of these targeted ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the premier buy-side advertising platform, The Trade Desk has attracted more than 1,000 customers, and they stick around. The Trade Desk has had a retention rate of more than 95% for the past 10 years.\n\nThe Trade Desk's revenue has come primarily from North America, but it also has a large international opportunity. Approximately two-thirds of all advertising spending takes place outside North America, and yet only 11% of The Trade Desk's spending is international so far.\n\nQ1 2024 results confirmed that the company is continuing to improve as a business. Compared to Q1 of 2023, revenue grew by 28%, while net income increased from $9 million to $32 million. Revenue for Q2 is expected to increase by 23% year over year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Confluent right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Confluent, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Confluent wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) continue to crush the market. The leading designer of accelerator chips for the explosive artificial intelligence (AI) market has seen a 215% stock price run in 52 weeks, including an 82% jump since the start of 2024. Nvidia is going from strength to strength, beating analyst estimates in each earnings report and building a mountain of AI-based profits.\n\nBut the stock market has priced a lot of future success into Nvidia's stock. The AI hardware master trades at kingly valuation ratios such as 75 times earnings and 34 times sales. I completely understand if you're not comfortable buying into a trillion-dollar stock at these lofty prices, no matter how bright its future might be. After all, I sold some of my own Nvidia stock a couple of months ago in order to reinvest some winnings in lower-priced growth stocks.\n\nLet's look at two tech stocks that, like Nvidia, have strong growth potential today. One is available at a far more attractive valuation, and the other operates in a less crowded industry.\n\nThis ad-tech stock makes sense with a lofty price\n\nForget flashy AI breakthroughs for a moment. Do you want to invest in the backbone of the internet economy?\n\nThe Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is disrupting one of the most fundamental aspects of the modern digital world -- targeted advertising. As the leading independent platform on the ad-buying side of the equation, TTD is at the forefront of reshaping how companies reach customers across the rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nIts dedication to research and development, evidenced by consistently increasing R&D spending, has positioned the company to lead the charge in an era without basic user-tracking tools like the third-party tracking cookie. TTD designed an alternative solution called Unified ID 2.0, is establishing this system as an industry standard, and stands ready to lean on it as the old cookies go away.\n\nAnd TTD's marketing solutions are striking a chord with advertisers desperate to wring the last drop of sales-boosting efficiency out of their limited budgets. This industry has been through a sharp downturn during the inflation crisis, seen in the form of restrained or even negative revenue trends across the industry. But The Trade Desk never got that memo, and its sales never stopped soaring: TTD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nI'll admit that The Trade Desk's stock is about as richly priced as Nvidia's. However, I'm less worried about competitive pressure in this case, and The Trade Desk stands much earlier in a story of long-term growth across enormous target markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo if you're looking for an investment that directly drives how businesses operate in the digital era, TTD might be a smarter bet than Nvidia's more speculative investment thesis.\n\nHere's a rocket ship held down by gravity\n\nNow I'm getting to the stock that actually holds the bulk of my Nvidia gains.\n\nMedia-streaming technology expert Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU)absolutely crushed Wall Street's consensus estimates in the first quarter of 2024. Revenues came in 4% above the average analyst estimates and the net loss was about half as deep as Wall Street expected.\n\nReports like that are usually fodder for skyrocketing stock price gains. Instead, Roku's shares fell more than 10% the next day, adding more pain to an already sunken stock chart. The price drop stemmed from modest guidance for the next quarter, where the year-over-year comparisons will be made against a 2023 period where revenues rose on a price increase and a richer mix of ad-infused services.\n\nI get it. The digital advertising downturn is still in effect, though it's fading out in a healthier economy. And nobody likes to see annual comparisons go down, even if it's because the year-ago results were artificially boosted and hard to match. Oh, and the targeted advertising market is teeming with both new and experienced channels, all trying to grab a large slice of the available ad-buying action.\n\nBut you shouldn't stop reading Roku's guidance at that point. Go on for just a few more sentences, and you'll run into a more optimistic analysis.\n\n\"We remain confident in our ability to accelerate the growth of Platform revenue and continue to grow Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in 2025 and beyond,\" the management team stated. \"Roku has a direct relationship with more than 81 million Streaming Households, and we are deepening relationships with third-party platforms including DSPs, retail media networks, and measurement partners. Our business remains well positioned to capture the billions of dollars in traditional TV ad budgets that will shift to streaming.\"\n\nIn other words, the company is poised to soar as the ad market stabilizes and then takes off. You may have to wait until 2025, but the launch is coming. Remember The Trade Desk from the scribblings above? Well, Roku just entered a partnership with that ad-selling expert to put Roku's ad-serving properties in easy reach for TTD's buyers.\n\nSo Roku investors have a lot to look forward to. Meanwhile, the stock stands 47% below its yearly highs and an astounding 88% below the peaks of 2021. Changing hands at just 2.3 times sales and 20 times free cash flows, Roku is a high-octane growth stock trading like a deep-discount value investment.\n\nNvidia's shares may rise from here but Roku's prospective gains look much richer -- and more likely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roku wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $550,688!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Trade Desk, Inc. Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "A week ago, The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) came out with a strong set of quarterly numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 2.1% to hit US$491m. Trade Desk also reported a statutory profit of US$0.06, which was an impressive 107% above what the analysts had forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Trade Desk  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing the latest results, Trade Desk's 33 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$2.41b in 2024. This would be a notable 17% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to bounce 67% to US$0.69. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.39b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.64 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Trade Desk's earnings potential following these results.\n\nThe consensus price target was unchanged at US$99.10, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Trade Desk, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$115 and the most bearish at US$35.00 per share. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Trade Desk'shistorical trends, as the 24% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 27% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.3% annually. So although Trade Desk is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Trade Desk following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Trade Desk analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether management and directors have been buying or selling stock recently.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy.\n\nThe advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year.\n\nAd Revenue on the Rise for Digital Advertising Companies\n\nIn recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company\u2019s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business:\n\n\u201c...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company\u2019s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.\u201d\n\nWhile the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company\u2019s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company\u2019s Q1 2024\u00a0earnings call:\n\n\u201cThe strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we\u2019re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It\u2019s very early for streaming TV ads but we\u2019re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It\u2019s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.\u201d\n\nBarclays Identifies Microsoft's Ad Business Potential\n\nOn February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company\u2019s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies. Barclays has a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares with a $475 price target.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings on April 25, posting an EPS of $2.94 against $2.82 expectations. Its revenue of $61.9 billion was up over 17% year-over-year, and outperformed the estimates by $971.29 million. The company\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella made the following comments at its Q3 2024 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWe once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest-rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines, and descriptions.\u201d\n\nKeeping in mind the recent growth in advertising and marketing industry earnings across the board, some of the best marketing stocks to buy are Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:IAS), Nexxen International Ltd. (NASDAQ:NEXN), and Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE:BOC). 12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\n12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 30 marketing and advertising agency stocks from SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:MRAD), Yahoo Finance stock screener, and some of our prior related articles. Next, we took each stock\u2019s analyst sentiment from The Wall Street Journal and narrowed down our list to the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside, as of May 9.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around each stock has also been added. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\n12. Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.4%\n\nOmnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is a New York-based company that provides advertising, marketing, and corporate communications services. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 27 hedge funds had stakes in the stock with total positions worth $694.181 million. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the most dominant shareholder in the company with a stake worth $244.483 million.\n\nOn May 7, Barclays upgraded Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight and increased the price target to $110 from $100. The stock has Buy-equivalent ratings as per the 11 out of 15 Wall Street analysts that have covered it over the past three months. As of May 9, the average price target of $107.58 represents an upside of 12.4% to the stock\u2019s current price.\n\nIntegral Ad Science Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:IAS), Nexxen International Ltd. (NASDAQ:NEXN), and Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE:BOC) are some of the best marketing stocks to buy, along with Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC).\n\nArtisan Partners made the following comment about Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOmnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is a global advertising and marketing services holding company. Organic growth came in slightly lighter than expected, which caused the stock to sell off. Even after the pullback, the stock has returned 22% over the prior one year. The business, while cyclical due to its ties to ad spend, is a royalty on competition as clients around the world seek Omnicom\u2019s expertise in creating, managing and tracking advertising campaigns. The business generates strong free cash flow, which has funded capital return in the form of share repurchases and dividends (3.8% current dividend yield), and is mostly a cost-plus business, which lessens the risk of margin pressure. Omnicom also has a flexible cost model allowing it to cut overhead during economic downturns to protect operating profit. While we cannot predict the economic cycle, Omnicom is a business that has delivered high returns on equity over a full business cycle and is currently selling at an attractive ~12X earnings.\u201d\n\n11. Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 15\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.57%\n\nCriteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO) is a France-based company that offers marketing and monetization services, including contextual advertising, video advertising, and others.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About The Trade Desk (TTD): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about The Trade Desk (TTD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nThe Trade Desk currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.44, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.44 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.8% and 7.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for TTD Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for TTD\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for The Trade Desk here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying The Trade Desk, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs TTD a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for The Trade Desk, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.49.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Trade Desk. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for The Trade Desk.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reported EPS is $0.26, expectations were $0.2175. The Trade Desk, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Greetings. Welcome to the Trade Desk First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to, everyone. Welcome to the Trade Desk first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green, and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements.\n\nShould any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections, or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release, and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a very promising start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 28% compared with last year, marking strong revenue growth acceleration on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. Outpacing the industry for a quarter or two is a great accomplishment. But I'm so proud of our team for now having outpaced the digital advertising industry for a couple of years straight. I believe our revenue growth acceleration in the first quarter speaks to the innovation and value that we're delivering to our clients with Kokai. It also reflects growing awareness among the world's leading advertisers of the value and power of the best of the open Internet.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo put a finer point on this, more than 90% of the Ad Age Top 200, the largest 200 advertisers in the world, have run advertising campaigns on our platform over the last 12 months. Even with its considerable size, CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel. Over the past few months, industry giants like Disney, NBCU, Walmart, Amazon, and now Roku, and LG Electronics have all made deeper pivots into CTV, many of them in partnership with us, bringing more opportunity for advertisers. UID2 has become ubiquitous across the premium parts of the open Internet, and along with greater first-party data deployment and advances in emerging data markets, especially retail data, we are building the new identity and authentication fabric of the Internet.\n\nIn doing so, the open Internet is getting replumbed and revalued, especially in contrast to the value offered by walled gardens. And the innovations in our Kokai platform will help our clients take advantage of this revaluation and fully leverage data-driven buying to fuel their own business growth. As a result, I've never been more optimistic about the future of the open Internet, and our ability to gain more than our fair share of the nearly $1 trillion advertising TAM. Let me dig into this a little deeper. I'd like to frame my remarks with just a little context on how our industry has advanced over the years, at least in part because of some of the significant and disruptive events today. I think this framing is important because I believe we may be in the midst of another period of major disruption right now.\n\nAnd perhaps most important, I believe our ability to anticipate and innovate in these moments positions us very well moving forward. I've often said that the programmatic industry, as we know it today, came to life as a result of the global financial crisis just over 15 years ago. At that time, there was tremendous pressure on all businesses to do more with less and to find new ways to differentiate, automate, and grow more efficiently. With those pressures, the precision and value of programmatic became more immediately apparent to major brand advertisers, and this proved to be a fertile environment for our business and so many others. Similarly, the rapid rise of CTV as the driving force of programmatic would not have happened so quickly were it not for the COVID pandemic.\n\nWith stay-at-home directives around the world, consumers shifted in mass to the convenience of streaming, and the media world hasn't been the same since. TV has always been the central element of major brand advertising campaigns, so the shift from linear to CTV was always going to be disruptive. What's perhaps more important is how quickly the TV industry has evolved as a result. CTV is now a driving force in how we think about things like authentication, identity, the use of retail data, relevance, and attribution in advertising. And while it may not be as apparent as a global financial crisis or a global pandemic, I believe we're now in the middle of another great disruption in our industry. This disruption is very different because it is driven from major tectonic shifts within our own industry instead of from macroeconomic and pandemic forces.\n\nToday's shift is largely driven from the conflict Apple and Google are having with governments and domino effects that are coming from new draconian policies and tactics coming from wounded big tech. For the last couple of years now, we've delivered consistent, durable revenue growth over 20%, significantly outpacing the broader market, including the major walled gardens, and it's because the contrast between the best of the open Internet, what you might call the premium Internet. And the content and characteristics of walled gardens has never been more apparent. The details of the Texas Attorney General's suit against Google and the approaching trial of the Department of Justice versus Google have shined a light on a few themes inside of Google, but has created a lot of clarity on things outside of Google as well.\n\nThere is a wider understanding of a few immediate themes facing advertising. First, there is a broader understanding of the role that walled gardens are playing as major purveyors of low-grade made-for-advertising inventory. Second, there is a much wider understanding of how bad ad-to-content ratios within walled gardens and the brand suitability risk of user-generated content or UGC. This is in part due to the stark contrast that premium content has right now to UGC. The industry has growing awareness that consumers spend most of their quality time with premium content on the open Internet versus the walled gardens. Advertisers are making better use of their first-party data and retail data as they explore contemporary cross-channel alternatives to cookies.\n\nAnd lastly, in advertising and marketing, like in many other sectors, there is a broad industry frenzy around AI and what it means for our industry. Taken together, I don't know that I've ever seen the industry in such a state of transition. In some corners of our industry, I also sense some panic and confusion about what to do next. But for us, this gives context to our recent outperformance, as well as our conviction for why I'm so confident about the opportunity in front of us in 2024 and the years ahead. One insight that reinforces this shift that is happening is found in where I'm spending my time. Over the last six months or so, I have been spending more and more of my time with CEOs, CMOs, and heads of media companies, helping them make sense of the issues that I just outlined.\n\nAnd the bottom line across all of these discussions, there is consensus that the value is shifting to the open Internet. But perhaps I should be more specific. It's shifting to the best of the open Internet, what we might call the premium Internet. It won't all happen overnight, but it is starting. In 2022, that marked the first year in a decade that the majority of digital ad spending took place outside of Meta and Google. With the proliferation of CTV and retail media, that trend accelerated last year, and I believe the trend will only continue moving forward. The role of CTV and digital audio in all of this should not be understated. For many people, movies, TV, and audio consumption is a very important part of their daily lives. It's premium quality content that captivates consumers who spend significant amounts of time engaging with it.\n\nNo one watches Mandalorian or Curb Your Enthusiasm or March Madness casually. No one listens to their favorite podcast passively. I found in every aspect of my life, I can't talk to anyone about premium CTV content or the best of music without people sharing a passion for some form of those mediums. We are all highly invested in it. That's very different than how consumers engage or talk about social media content, which is often short-form UGC video such as cat videos or 14 year-olds filming themselves falling off of bicycles. However, people spend much more time with premium content such as streaming TV and digital audio than they do with UGC. Our research shows consumers spend about 60% of their online time on the open Internet. The ad-to-content ratios are much better and therefore the experience is much better.\n\nBut walled gardens still command the bulk of digital advertising spend because those tech giants have made it super easy to reach consumers at mass scale, and the performance results are equally simplified. Hey, look, your ads did great. We told you so, so it must be true. But that's changing. Advertisers now have scaled alternatives on the open Internet. One of the major innovations in Kokai is the Sellers and Publishers 500 Plus. This is a curated marketplace that represents the best of the open Internet, the premium Internet, where consumers spend the majority of their time online. It's live sports events such as March Madness, where we saw a 200% increase in spend compared to a year ago. It's the latest movies and hot TV shows. It's music and podcasts on platforms like Spotify.\n\nIt's trusted journalism. Now, our advertisers can access that premium marketplace at scale easily and with confidence. In doing so, they don't have to cede control of their valuable first-party data, they get to measure effectively, and they can be sure that their ads are showing up against high-quality content that's consistent with their brand. Advertisers now have a scaled way to control their own future. Of course, our ability to buy the best of the open Internet is based on close working relationships with the world's leading publishers. Across the board, publishers are working with us to make advertiser access to their inventory as attractive as possible, which means making it as transparent and objective as possible. You only have to look at the list of expanded partnerships that we've signed over the last few weeks.\n\nWe are integrating directly with the Disney real-time ad exchange, which includes Hulu and Disney+ via our OpenPath technology. For the first time ever, NBCU will make the Olympics available programmatically to advertisers and is doing so with The Trade Desk. LG Electronics has adopted UID2. Vizio and Cox Media Group are connecting with us via Openpath. TF1 and M6, two of the largest broadcasters in France, have integrated EUID as they make their content available programmatically. And just a week ago, Roku announced that it is expanding its demand strategy to include The Trade Desk or its premium content. Just to go one click deeper on Roku, I think it makes a ton of sense for Roku to embrace the open Internet with their premium content. Early on, when CTV inventory was scarce, it made sense for many of the premium CTV streamers to sell most of the inventory themselves. A large array of computer screens and tech equipment representing the technology company's self-service cloud-based platform.\n\nWith the proliferation of CTV content over the last couple of years, those same companies now need to find ways to maximize advertiser demand, and that means opening up to a broader range of demand sources such as The Trade Desk and embracing solutions such as UID2, which help advertisers find their target audience as accurately as possible. We are excited to be Roku's partner in this, and we believe this move is a win-win-win for Roku, for advertisers, and for The Trade Desk. As a reminder, last year on 06/06, we started shipping Kokai. This platform launch is different for us because 06/06 last year marked just the beginning, and we've been shipping new features ever since. We are quickly approaching some of the biggest UX and product rollouts of Kokai that nearly all of our customers will begin to use and cede benefits from over the next few quarters, including a game-changing AI-fueled forecasting tool.\n\nAnother major innovation that we're bringing to market with Kokai is a completely new approach to audience-based buying. We're able to do this because of the broad availability of new identifiers such as UID2, along with easier on-ramps for first-party data. This means advertisers can now take what they know about their most loyal customers and find new customers who look just like the loyal ones, and find them anywhere across the open Internet. Advertisers no longer have to use content as a proxy for audience. Instead of simply advertising against the NBA playoffs to reach pizza lovers, advertisers can find pizza lovers wherever they are across all digital channels. In Asia, Unilever and their agency, PHD, leveraged our retail partnership in Kokai with foodpanda to increase sales of their Knorr food sauces.\n\nUnilever was able to onboard its own first-party data on our platform, then do look-alike modeling for foodpanda's retail conversion and loyalty data to target new customers more precisely on the open Internet. This new audience-based approach resulted in a 229% improvement in customers adding Knorr products to their shopping basket, and an 81% improvement in customer conversion. Just like Unilever, more and more advertisers are prioritizing ad opportunities where they can be sure they are reaching their target audience. And increasingly, that means activating their first-party data effectively, and leveraging ad impressions where UID2 is present. This is the new identity fabric of the Internet taking shape, and it's revaluing the Internet in the process.\n\nRecently, Target Australia and their agency OMD worked with us to upload their first-party customer data into our platform, then, targeted new customers using UID2. Their conversion rate improved 66% versus using traditional identifiers, and their cost per action decreased 36%. And there are huge benefits to publishers who offer transparency and authenticated audience data to advertisers. Unwind Media is one of the world's leading gaming platforms. They recently reported that they saw a 47% improvement in the value of ad impressions when deterministic identifiers such as UID2 are present, and 107% improvement when users are authenticated with SSOs such as OpenPass. Let me also spend a moment on AI, not because we're trying to get on the bandwagon.\n\nWe've been deploying AI in our platform since we launched Koa in 2016. Given the frenzy around AI, I think it's important to talk about how it is actually helping advance the work of programmatic advertising. Too much discussion on AI today is about AI in the abstract instead of practical details about implementation. We are starting to get better at explaining how our AI investments will actually help people do their jobs better. To that end, we've known, since before our company existed, that the complexity of assessing millions of ad opportunities every second, along with hundreds of variables for each impression, is beyond the scope of any individual human. We have always thought about AI as a co-pilot for our hands-on keyboard traders.\n\nAnd with Kokai, we are bringing the power of AI to a broader range of key decision points than ever, whether it's in relevance scoring, forecasting, budget optimization, frequency management, or upgraded measurement. AI is also incorporated into a series of new indices that score relevance, which advertisers can use to better understand the relevance of different ad impressions in reaching their target audience. For example, UScellular worked with their agency, Harmelin Media, to leverage our TV Quality Index to better reach new customers. Their conversion rates improved 71%. They reached 66% more households by optimizing frequency management and their cost per acquisition decreased 24%. I think it's important to understand how we're putting AI to work in Kokai because this kind of tech dislocation will bring new innovators.\n\nWe see that now where major tech players are inviting scrutiny because they're behind the innovation curve on AI, and more agile players, and I would include the Trade Desk in that bucket, are figuring out how to apply it to help humans make better, more data-driven decisions. We are also developing AI branded with Koa to make data-driven refinements on its own, within the confines of human-defined guardrails. Let me close by trying to bring all of this together and help you understand why I believe this positions The Trade Desk so well going forward. I can't explain it any better than Jamie Power, the SVP of Addressable Sales at Disney, who spoke at our recent Forward '24 event in New York City. Disney is one of the pioneers of CTV technology and Jamie talked about how UID2 is helping Disney offer advertiser match rates that are 3 times to 4 times higher than when UID2 is not present, and higher CPMs are clearly following higher match rates.\n\nThat's a pretty astonishing statement about where the Internet is heading. Disney deals with an authenticated audience, and they're leveraging UID2, so advertisers can find the right customers with much more precision in TV than ever before, against what many would consider some of the most premium content on the open Internet. With the growing ubiquity of UID2, with new approaches to authentication, with better deployment of first-party data, with easier access to the premium Internet, and with major advances in AI, the ability for advertisers to reach the right audience, at the right time, in the right place, and convert those customers has never been greater, and all of that's happening in our platform. And all of that happens with the advertiser in control of their data, understanding more precisely where their dollars are going, how they should optimize, and how those ads are performing in service of their KPIs. None of what I just ran through is really possible in a walled garden.\n\nI might not go as far as to say we're seeing the early days of the fall of Rome, but the current macro and tech forces are creating an important moment of the reckoning for everyone in our industry, and advertisers are shifting more dollars to us as a result. Advertisers want a competitive market with price discovery because they want to own their own future. It is easier than ever for advertisers to understand who is delivering value at all points of the digital advertising supply chain, and they will increasingly gravitate to those who are helping them make the most of every advertising dollar with transparency and objectivity. Of course, this is all made possible by our profitable business model, which generates significant cash flow, which in turn allows us to invest in the major platform upgrades that characterize Kokai.\n\nSo while I believe 2024 will be remembered as a year of great tech-driven disruption in our industry, I also believe it is a year that The Trade Desk will continue to differentiate itself from its competitors, and continue to outpace the market. As the industry races towards $1 trillion TAM, we are incredibly well-positioned to take more than our fair share. With that, I will hand it over to Laura, who will take you through more of the financial details.\n\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. The Trade Desk delivered another strong quarter as revenue was $491 million, a 28% increase year-over-year. Our growth is further evidence of the durable value that The Trade Desk brings our clients, and we continue to outperform the industry as a result. All of our progress in areas such as CTV, retail media, Kokai, and UID2 helped deliver another quarter of consistently strong growth and profitability to start 2024. In addition to strong top-line performance, I am proud of the $162 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 33%. Our strong growth in Q1 was broad-based in terms of geography and channel diversity. Strength in CTV continued as the channel led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again.\n\nWe also continue to see strong momentum in retail media as we continue to win shopper marketing budgets and as more of our existing clients utilize third-party retail data for targeting and measurement. UID2 is being deployed by major advertisers and publishers at a larger scale than ever, and we continue to see the benefits from strengthening our relationships with major brands and their agencies. From a scaled channel perspective in Q1, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percent share of our business and continued to grow as a percent of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percent share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of the spend and international represented about 12% of spend for the first quarter.\n\nWe saw strong consistent year-over-year growth across all of our regions in Q1, with international growth outpacing North America for the fifth quarter in a row. We continue to execute our growth playbook internationally, led by CTV and retail media. We remain optimistic that our business outside North America continues to be a strong contributor to our overall growth this year, and for years to come. In terms of verticals, every category greater than 1% of spend grew double-digits in Q1. It's exciting to deliver such consistent growth across the business, and we're proud to see the value of the open Internet or premium Internet resonating with clients for many industries. Turning now to expenses. Q1 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $352 million, up 20% year-over-year.\n\nWe continue to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and platform operations as we position the organization for long-term growth. Income tax expense was $14 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $185 million and free cash flow was $176 million in Q1. DSOs exiting Q1 were 86 days, down two days from a year ago. DPOs were 70 days, down two days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion.\n\nWe have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, in Q1, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $125 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically, depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $575 million, which would represent growth of approximately 24% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $223 million in Q2. In closing, we are encouraged about the momentum of our business. We're executing on large long-term growth drivers including CTV, international expansion, retail media, our recent platform upgrade in Kokai, UID2, as well as the upcoming US election cycle.\n\nWe continue to generate strong free cash flow, grow our headcount efficiently, and maintain a balance sheet that positions us to continue investing in achieving durable growth. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business in the remainder of 2024 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n10 Fastest Growing Cities in New York State and\n\n25 Richest Billionaires in Manufacturing Industry.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

CTV (Connected TV) continues to be the fastest-growing channel for The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD), highlighting the company's successful expansion in this area. The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD) has successfully integrated UID2 across premium parts of the open Internet, enhancing identity and authentication frameworks. Significant partnerships with major industry players like Disney, NBCU, and Roku have been established, expanding The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD)'s market opportunities. The introduction of Kokai platform innovations has enabled The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD) to offer advanced data-driven buying options to clients, improving client outcomes and business growth.\n\nNegative Points\n\nDespite strong growth, The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD) faces intense competition from major tech companies and other advertising platforms, which could impact market share. The reliance on continuous innovation and the rapid pace of technological change in the advertising industry pose ongoing challenges for The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD). Regulatory uncertainties and potential changes in data privacy laws could impact The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD)'s operations and client data strategies. The complexity of integrating new technologies and platforms, such as UID2 and Kokai, may result in operational challenges and increased costs. Market saturation and the high penetration rate in digital advertising could slow down future growth rates for The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD).\n\nStory continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Jeff, at the last Investor Day, you spoke about Connected TV forming a tidal wave. We're now starting to see Disney, Roku, and even NBC with the Olympics leaning more on programmatic, suggesting that CTV won't be just a walled garden world here. It will actually be more open. So where do you think you are right now in just that tipping point from linear TV spend flowing into connected TV? And how are you thinking about the right investment level to seize that opportunity? A: Jeffrey Terry Green - The Trade Desk, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO: Thanks, Justin. I appreciate the question. So first, I think it's just important to take a step back and just look at where we've come from. It's been a few years. It wasn't that long ago that people were saying, oh, cable has got a long life. It's not going to be that long, and then the pandemic accelerated everything. Then we started talking about a new currency like UID2 and there was a fair amount of, well, are you sure you can get adoption on that? It seems like CTV has a lot of defenses or ways that it's going to be reluctant to adopt something new.\n\nQ: Congrats on another really strong quarter and outlook. I had a 2-part question. Jeff, I guess, following up on the first question, how do you think about the impact of Amazon's ad-supported Prime video offering from a competitive perspective? And then for the second part, this is related. Disney called out in their earnings call that there's a lot more supply in the market as a result of the competitor entering the ad-supported tier. And I think everyone's assuming that that's Amazon. And there are just some concerns out there that a massive influx of CTV inventory at lower CPMs, good depressed the CTV market overall without necessarily driving more demand. So I'm just curious kind of your thoughts on how all of this affects you guys and the industry. A: Jeffrey Terry Green - The Trade Desk, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO: You bet. So can you remind me of the first part of your question? So how does the increase in supply -- I get on the second part. Remind me of the first part of your question?\n\nQ: Jeff, it looks like third-party cookies won't be going away now for at least until '25. What are your thoughts on the cookie deprecation delay once again? And how, if at all, it impacts the industry? And then maybe secondarily, could the continued delays have any impacts, positive or negative, on UID 2.0 adoption? A: Jeffrey Terry Green - The Trade Desk, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO: Great. And so first, I'm glad to get this question on cookie deprecation not because I haven't heard it before but in an effort to hopefully put it to bed for at least a little while until the next headline hit. I've been blown away by how much in trade press, there has been discussion about cookies. And maybe it's because I felt like it was a very important topic to talk about 2 or 3 years ago, but I just feel like we already had all these conversations.\n\nQ: Jeff, I would like to ask you to talk about the deeper partnership with Roku that was announced last week. We heard some commentary from Roku. And from your perspective, what would you highlight for us that is significant for the Street to know? And in addition, as this progresses, I think the time line is a couple of quarters out. Can this lead to increased volume of CTV advertising for The Trade Desk? And if so, how would that mechanics work? A: Jeffrey Terry Green - The Trade Desk, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO: Thanks. So it's early days in the specifics of our partnership, but we're very excited about the long-standing relationship that we've had with Roku and seeing it finally materialize into something meaningful. And I do believe this is something meaningful. The Roku Channel has grown tremendously over the last couple of years. So as they become more and more into content, and that includes having more ads, we're excited to have access to those in large part because we view Roku as a key premium publisher in the connected television space.\n\nQ: Can you just talk more about the expanded OpenPath partnership with Disney's streaming properties? Curious how this impacts just the amount of CTV inventory that you're now able to access compared to what you had before? A: Jeffrey Terry Green - The Trade Desk, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO: You bet. So let me just take a step back to explain what OpenPath is. Over the years, the supply path in digital advertising has gotten more and more convoluted. And sometimes it's because of the tactics used in companies like Google, where the DoubleClick Ad Exchange was once a pure theme and then they introduced things like Open Bidding and Open Bidding is really the backdrop whereby they created a lot of funky options that are described in the Texas Attorney General's complaint.\n\nQ: I want to ask a question about social video. It seems that it's been gaining share and as linear dollars are just kind of leaving linear, like it's definitely competing with CTV for a share of those dollars. Just any thoughts about how you think about that, how you can kind of utilize that channel for your customers? And then it also seems to be perhaps pushing CTV to embrace more data to try to be competitive with that. And so maybe comment on that, agree, disagree, et cetera. A: Jeffrey Terry Green - The Trade Desk, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO: You bet. So in the move from offline advertising, which, of course, pre-Internet was everything. And in the world of digital, everything has been shifting towards digitization and eventually we think all advertising will be transacted digitally even for the small minority of that, that has not actually executed digitally. So we'll use digital pipes even if we're going to run an ad in print, for instance. So everything is moving to digital.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

Find out in our full research report.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $491.3 million vs analyst estimates of $480.5 million (2.2% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.26 vs analyst estimates of $0.22 (20.7% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $575 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $567.1 million Gross Margin (GAAP): 78.9%, up from 77.8% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $176.3 million, up 176% from the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $43.81 billion\n\nFounded by former Microsoft engineers Jeff Green and Dave Pickles, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) offers cloud-based software that uses data to help advertisers better plan, place, and target their online ads.\n\nAdvertising Software\n\nThe digital advertising market is large, growing, and becoming more diverse, both in terms of audiences and media. As a result, there is a growing need for software that enables advertisers to use data to automate and optimize ad placements.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, The Trade Desk's revenue growth has been very strong over the last three years, growing from $219.8 million in Q1 2021 to $491.3 million this quarter. The Trade Desk Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, The Trade Desk's quarterly revenue was once again up a very solid 28.3% year on year. However, the company's revenue actually decreased by $114.5 million in Q1 compared to the $112.5 million increase in Q4 CY2023. Regardless, we aren't too concerned because The Trade Desk's sales seem to follow a seasonal pattern and management is guiding for revenue to rebound in the coming quarter.\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that The Trade Desk is expecting revenue to grow 23.9% year on year to $575 million, in line with the 23.2% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 21.2% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nStory continues\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. The Trade Desk's free cash flow came in at $176.3 million in Q1, roughly the same as last year. The Trade Desk Free Cash Flow\n\nThe Trade Desk has generated $542.6 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 26.4% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance.\n\nKey Takeaways from The Trade Desk's Q1 Results\n\nIt was encouraging to see The Trade Desk beat analysts' revenue guidance expectations. We were also glad its revenue this quarter outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin declined. Zooming out, we think this was still a decent quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. The stock is up 1.4% after reporting and currently trades at $87.3 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in The Trade Desk right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

However, small-cap stocks were the laggards of the day, with the Russell 2000 Index declining by 0.9%.\n\nIn the commodities market, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s report of a decline in crude oil inventories last week led to a modest 0.6% increase in West Texas Intermediate prices. Gold prices remained steady, while silver experienced a modest uptick of 0.6%.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded flat at $62,300.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance Of Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price Chg % Dow Jones 38,938.23 +53.97 0.1% Nasdaq 100 18,062.51 -28.94 -0.2% S&P 500 5,177.51 -10.19 -0.2% Russell 2000 2,056.16 -1.81 -0.9%\n\nUpdated at 12:54 EDT\n\nWednesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nUber Technologies Inc.

This is expected to have contributed to the company\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across TTD\u2019s two initiatives, namely UID2 and OpenPass, which focus on identity and authentication in the post-cookie era, is expected to have benefited from increased demand for its advertising services in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s expanding partner base, which includes the likes of HP HPQ, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD and Walmart WMT, is expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, Warner Bros. Discovery announced its integration with UID2 across its premium entertainment, sports, news and lifestyle brands, extending to its digital platforms such as Max and Discovery+.\r\n\r\nWalmart Connect also announced its initiation of testing the integration of UID2 to enhance decision-making capabilities across the open internet within the Walmart DSP.\r\n\r\nHP implemented UID2 for CTV campaigns on platforms such as Disney and Hulu in the fourth quarter, resulting in enhanced targeting and decreased ad spend wastage.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Desk currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe Trade Desk beat analysts' revenue expectations by 4% last quarter, reporting revenues of $605.8 million, up 23.4% year on year. It was an impressive quarter for the company, with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a solid beat of analysts' billings estimates.\n\nIs The Trade Desk a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting The Trade Desk's revenue to grow 25.5% year on year to $480.5 million, improving from the 21.4% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.22 per share. The Trade Desk Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. The Trade Desk has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 2.7% on average.\n\nLooking at The Trade Desk's peers in the sales and marketing software segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Zeta delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 23.7%, beating analysts' expectations by 4.2%, and GoDaddy reported revenues up 7%, topping estimates by 1.1%. GoDaddy's stock price was unchanged following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Zeta's results here and GoDaddy's results here.\n\nInvestors in the sales and marketing software segment have had fairly steady hands going into earnings, with share prices down 1.5% on average over the last month.

        "title": "Trade Desk Insiders Sell US$2.7m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "Many The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nTrade Desk Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Lead Independent Director, Lise Buyer, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.5m worth of shares at a price of US$75.20 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$88.59, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 16% of Lise Buyer's stake.\n\nTrade Desk insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nTrade Desk Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Trade Desk. Specifically, Executive VP Samantha Jacobson ditched US$519k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nDoes Trade Desk Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Trade Desk insiders own about US$4.1b worth of shares (which is 9.6% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Trade Desk Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Trade Desk is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREEreport showing analyst forecasts for Trade Desk.\n\nBut note: Trade Desk may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Is The Deal Between Roku and The Trade Desk a Game Changer?",
        "content": "One of the biggest challenges to emerge from the ongoing shift from traditional television viewing to streaming is the changing paradigm for advertisers. Once upon a time, it was easy for marketers to reach their desired audiences, but the shift to streaming and the proliferation of viewing options has made it more difficult than ever for advertisers to reach their target markets.\n\nNow, streaming platform Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) and programmatic advertising leader The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) are joining forces to help bridge the gap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo digital advertising dynamos\n\nIn a press release that dropped on Tuesday, The Trade Desk and Roku announced \"a new data-driven TV streaming partnership\" to help advertisers plan more effective ad campaigns for streaming viewers. The goal of the partnership is \"to leverage Roku Media and audience and behavioral data so that The Trade Desk customers can better understand and optimize their campaigns for TV streaming viewers.\"\n\nRoku is the top streaming platform in the U.S., with more than 81.6 million households in its fold. Furthermore, the Roku smart TV operating system (OS) is the No. 1 selling TV OS in the U.S. and Mexico and was in roughly 40% of all TVs sold in the first quarter. The company has also been selling its own Roku-branded connected TVs (CTV), further expanding its reach.\n\n\"CTV has emerged as one of the most powerful digital advertising channels on the open internet,\" said Jed Dederick, The Trade Desk's chief revenue officer. \"This new partnership with Roku will enable The Trade Desk's clients to put valuable new data insights to work and fully optimize their [advertising] campaigns,\" he said.\n\n\"Matching Roku's reach with the power of The Trade Desk's innovative solutions will unlock new ways for marketers to reach the right TV streaming audiences strategically,\" said Jay Askinasi, Roku's global media chief.\n\nNot only will the partnership result in more effective advertising for The Trade Desk users, but it will also result in more advertising opportunities for Roku, which makes the lion's share of its revenue from the digital advertising shown on its platform. Underpinning this collaboration is Roku's vast database of audience and behavioral information, known as automatic content recognition (ACR) data.\n\nACR: A primer\n\nRoku is something of a pioneer in ACR. In fact, the company won a Technology and Engineering Emmy last year for its work in the field.\n\nWhen a user sets up their Roku account, they can opt-in to have their viewing preferences collected. Once they do, Roku keeps track of the shows they watch on its platform across traditional broadcast, cable, and streaming channels in order to make more accurate recommendations. Additionally, the company maintains a catalog of advertising so it knows what ads viewers have seen and if they were engaged or if the ad caused them to change the channel.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result of this technology, Roku has a treasure trove of information regarding viewer preferences and can provide detailed data to help marketers make better-informed decisions about their target market. This also helps provide audiences with ads they might actually care about.\n\nAs the world's largest independent advertising technology leader, The Trade Desk already helps marketers make data-driven decisions about the ads they run -- particularly in the area of connected TV, which is the company's fastest-growing segment. By joining forces with Roku, The Trade Desk can provide advertisers that use its platform with even more granular data, which will help them deliver better, more effective advertising.\n\nIs the deal a game changer?\n\nThe Trade Desk's ad tech platform helps the world's largest ad agencies and their customers design better marketing campaigns to reach their desired audiences. Adding in Roku's first-party viewer data will significantly increase the potential for success for advertisers. Roku has unmatched reach, which will help The Trade Desk's advertisers enjoy \"meaningful outcomes through scale, premium inventory, and optimization capabilities that will help efficiently maximize ad spend.\"\n\nRoku signaled that it would be ramping up partnerships such as this one. During the company's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Anthony Wood said Roku was \"expanding and deepening our relationships with third-party platforms.\" This is a clear example of that strategy at work.\n\nThe deal seems like a win-win. The Trade Desk's customers will have better data to make advertising decisions, and Roku will likely benefit from a greater number of advertising opportunities on its platform. It could also eventually rise to the level of game changer, but only time will tell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roku wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 25 richest billionaires in media and entertainment industry. To skip our detailed analysis of the media and entertainment industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Media and Entertainment Industry.\n\nMedia and Entertainment Industry Outlook\n\nMedia and entertainment is a vast industry with many sectors including social media, film, music, television, and advertising, among others. On January 24, Variety reported that as per Omdia\u2019s senior research director Mar\u00eda Rua Aguete, the media and entertainment industry is expected to surpass a $1 trillion valuation in 2024. The trillion-dollar mark is driven by diverse segments, with online video projected to be valued at $345 billion, games at $255 billion, music at $44 billion, and cinema at $41 billion. These segments from the media and entertainment industry will significantly contribute to the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdowns, the media and entertainment industry saw a rise. However, things started to change post-pandemic. The global entertainment and media revenue increased by only 5.4% in 2022 compared to a growth of 10.6% in 2021. According to a report by PwC, the revenue of the global entertainment and media industry is set to decline sequentially in the next five years. The revenue for 2027 is expected to grow by just 2.8% from 2026. Among many factors influencing the slowdown of the media and entertainment industry, consumer spending will remain the key reason as it continues to drop considering interest rate hikes and inflation. In PwC\u2019s 26th Annual Global CEO Survey, around 40% of CEOs from the entertainment and media industry pointed out that their current business model would not be viable in ten years.\n\nBig Players in Media and Entertainment Industry\n\nCompanies in media and entertainment are trying to tap into new areas and markets. Advertising is one of the key areas for growth and AI is also a top trend in the industry with media giants investing hefty sums in the technology. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) are two of the most valuable entertainment companies in the world, while Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) owns some of the biggest social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an American multinational mass media and entertainment giant.

(NASDAQ:WBD) are forming a joint venture to launch an innovative streaming sports service. Through this joint venture, all the companies will bring their portfolios of sports networks. The joint venture platform is expected to be launched in the second half of 2024 and will be available for customers through a new app. Each entity of the joint venture will have an equal board representation and own one-third stake in the venture.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is another leading American multinational mass media and entertainment corporation.

On April 10, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced its next generation of custom-made chips designed to manage AI workloads.

        "content": "One million dollars might not be what it used to be, but it's still a worthy retirement goal. If you have supplementary income, such as Social Security or a pension, $1 million can certainly be enough of a nest egg to help you get through retirement comfortably.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have gotten much of the attention from investors these days, there are plenty of opportunities beyond AI for investors looking to grow their portfolios. Some stocks look well-prepared to turn $250,000 into $1 million. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the digital advertising industry. Ad agencies and brands turn to The Trade Desk's cloud-based, self-serve platform to help manage and optimize ad campaigns. The business has been highly successful, as the stock is up more than 2,000% since its 2016 initial public offering (IPO).\n\nUnlike a lot of growth stocks, The Trade Desk has been able to deliver both fast revenue growth and solid profits. For example, revenue jumped 23% to $606 million in the fourth quarter, and the company reported adjusted net income of $207 million.\n\nLooking ahead to the coming years, the company should continue to grow as the digital advertising market expands through channels like Connected TV, retail media, and new technologies. The company also looks poised to strengthen its leadership position. This is thanks to Unified ID 2.0, its protocol that looks set to replace third-party cookies when Google deprecates them on Chrome, and its new AI platform Kokai, which uses deep learning algorithms across the media buying process, improving visibility, insights, and return on investment (ROI) for advertisers.\n\nThe Trade Desk introduced Kokai last year, but CEO Jeff Green said the impact on the business and its customers should begin to be felt this year. That could drive a significant growth cycle for The Trade Desk over the coming years. If the company can continue growing on the top and bottom line by 20% or better, it could easily grow by 4X over the next decade.\n\n2. Roku\n\nLike Trade Desk, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) is another digital advertising stock with a lot of growth potential. Roku has struggled since the pandemic as advertisers pulled back on spending in anticipation of a recession that never came. While the company's revenue growth has improved, spending from the core media and entertainment vertical is still lagging.\n\nHowever, that should change in the coming years as legacy media businesses figure out the streaming business and viewers continue to shift from traditional pay-TV channels to streaming. While the business performance has been rocky, demand and consumption metrics continue to be strong, and active accounts and viewing hours are growing rapidly.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoku has fended off competition from much larger tech giants and continues to innovate with its own television sets, expanding to new countries, and beefing up its original content lineup. Meanwhile, the company will benefit from the increase in ad subscriptions in streaming, as a number of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon have recently launched ad tiers.\n\nRoku stock is down more than 80% from its peak during the pandemic and nearly 50% from its high point last November. From its current level, it shouldn't take much for the stock to deliver solid gains for investors, especially once its business model reaches an inflection point.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nFinally, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) also looks like a great stock to help you turn $250,000 into $1 million. The Latin American e-commerce company has built an impressive network of competitive advantages reminiscent of Amazon.\n\nIts e-commerce business includes both a first-party direct-sales operation and a third-party marketplace. The company also has a large fintech business in Mercado Pago, which has made it further entrenched with both merchants and consumers. It has its own logistics operation in Mercado Envios, giving it another revenue stream from e-commerce.\n\nMercadoLibre is also leveraging its core business into higher-margin revenue streams like advertising and credit.\n\nWhat's also been impressive about the company is its blistering revenue growth at a time when most e-commerce companies were struggling with a post-pandemic hangover. Revenue jumped 83% on a currency-neutral basis in the fourth quarter, with strong growth in e-commerce and digital payments. Meanwhile, its margins also ramped up as it pivots to higher-margin businesses.\n\nIf MercadoLibre continues to deliver rapid growth over the last decade, it shouldn't be hard for the stock to grow four-fold in value, helping turn $250,000 into $1 million.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why The Trade Desk (TTD) Outpaced the Stock Market Today",
        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with The Trade Desk (TTD) standing at $84.73, reflecting a +1.67% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.02%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.03%.\n\nThe digital-advertising platform operator's shares have seen a decrease of 4.67% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.32% and falling behind the S&P 500's loss of 3.15%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of The Trade Desk in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on May 8, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.22, marking a 4.35% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $479.63 million, indicating a 25.3% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.49 per share and revenue of $2.39 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.25% and +22.94%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for The Trade Desk. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. The Trade Desk is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, The Trade Desk is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 56.12. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 24.36.\n\nAlso, we should mention that TTD has a PEG ratio of 2.44.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 best streaming service stocks to buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming Service Stocks To Buy.\n\nIn recent years, the streaming TV landscape has seen a rapid expansion, with numerous new options entering the market. With a plethora of subscription internet TV services available, streaming entertainment has become a staple in American households, evidenced by the 99% of U.S. households subscribing to one or more streaming platforms.\u00a0 Leading the pack are Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s TV+. This widespread adoption reflects a shift in entertainment consumption, moving away from traditional cable TV models towards flexible, on-demand streaming options. On average, Americans maintain subscriptions to around 2.9 streaming services each month.\n\nAccording to a research report by Fortune Business Insights, the video streaming industry is a significant economic force, currently valued at an impressive $544 billion. This valuation not only reflects the industry's current success but also hints at its rapid expansion in the future. Projections suggest that by 2030, the industry could skyrocket to a staggering $1,902 billion. The financial trajectory of the video streaming industry also continues to surge, with revenue expected to reach $43.97 billion in 2024 alone. This robust growth is anticipated to persist, with revenue forecasted to climb to $54.22 billion by 2027, boasting an annual growth rate of 7.53% from 2024 to 2027.\n\nData from Nielsen, a leading data and market measurement firm, proves that the rise of streaming services has fundamentally altered TV viewing habits, with streaming content now being the primary driver of TV usage. In 2023, American audiences streamed a staggering 21 million years of video, marking a 21% increase from the 17 million years' worth they streamed in 2022. Amid these viewership patterns, one clear beneficiary emerged: the TV show \"Suits.\" Originally aired on USA Network from 2011 to 2019, \"Suits\" amassed a total of 57.7 billion viewing minutes in 2023, surpassing even the beloved favorite \"The Office,\" which garnered 57.1 billion viewing minutes in 2020 during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. In total, the top 10 titles in the U.S. collectively garnered over 133 billion minutes of viewing time last year.\n\nHowever, akin to other sectors, the streaming industry encounters its own set of challenges, most notably marked by heightened competition, which has spurred companies to invest billions in developing their own platforms and content libraries, aiming to compete with established industry leaders, which in turn prompted streaming services to adjust their subscription costs. For instance, The Verge reports that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has made changes to its subscription offerings, discontinuing the ad-free Basic plan priced at $11.99 per month for new or returning members. Instead, the company is transitioning to a model where ad-supported plans are available in select countries, starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s cheapest ad-free option is now priced at $15.49 per month. This increase in subscription rates can lead to higher number of subscription cancellation, as seen last year. In 2023, data analytics firm Antenna recorded 36.2 million more cancellations compared to the previous year, resulting in 17 million fewer net additions. This indicates that streaming services are facing a greater challenge in acquiring new subscribers despite their continued efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a different note, the music streaming scene in the U.S. has seen substantial evolution over the last decade. Presently, the United States records approximately 90 million paid music streaming subscribers, a significant leap from the mere 7.9 million users in the first half of 2014. Within the competitive realm of music streaming services, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands out as the clear frontrunner, holding a commanding 30.5% market share, while its closest competitor, Apple Music, trails with a 13.7% share.\n\nIn light of this, the burgeoning realms of streaming are not merely flourishing; they are fundamentally reshaping the landscape of entertainment and media consumption. The substantial financial implications, characterized by billions in revenue and considerable monthly expenditure on subscriptions, serve as a testament to the economic prowess wielded by these industries. With that in mind, investors looking to take part in this lucrative industry can look towards some of the best streaming service stocks to invest in, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 10 Best Streaming Service Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Ashley Byrd on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ve curated a list of the best streaming service stocks based on hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Can Mixed Fundamentals Have A Negative Impact on The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) Current Share Price Momentum?",
        "content": "Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 21% over the last three months. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Trade Desk's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:\n\n8.3% = US$179m \u00f7 US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Trade Desk's Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, Trade Desk's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 12%. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Trade Desk over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.\n\nWe then compared Trade Desk's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 12% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Trade Desk is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Trade Desk Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nTrade Desk doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. However, this doesn't explain why the company hasn't seen any growth. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Trade Desk. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar: 2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Bull Market",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is 16 months into a bull market and the index has already soared 53%, but history says it could move much higher in the next couple years. The Nasdaq returned an average of 215% during the eight bull markets since 1990, and it realized those gains over an average of 40 months.\n\nIf the current bull market aligns with that average, the Nasdaq will gain another 162% during the next two years. That implies annual returns above 60%, which is highly unlikely given the economic uncertainty. But whichever direction the wind blows in the near term, history says the index is headed much higher in the long term. The Nasdaq returned 15% annually over the last decade and similar results are likely during the next decade.\n\nInvestors hoping to capitalize on that momentum should buy a few shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD). Here's why.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three major markets -- e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud services -- and the company is gaining share in two of them. Specifically, it accounted for 39.6% of online retail sales in the United States last year, up 130 basis points (1.3 percentage points) from the prior year. It also accounted for 7.6% of global digital ad spending, up 80 basis points. That makes Amazon the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. and the third largest digital advertising company worldwide.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 31% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter, down two points from the previous year. However, AWS still leads the market, outranking second-place Microsoft Azure by seven points, according to Synergy Research. Dominance in cloud services means AWS is ideally positioned to benefit as businesses spend more on artificial intelligence.\n\nAmazon reported fourth-quarter financial results that beat the consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 14% to $170 billion as growth accelerated sequentially across every business segment except physical stores. Operating margin expanded 600 basis points and GAAP net income was $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year. Investors should expect similar sales momentum in the coming quarters.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate leaves room for upside if the company reclaims lost market share in cloud computing, a distinct possibility given its focus on AI product development. However, the current valuation of 3.3 times sales is reasonable even if the consensus sales forecast is correct.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a final thought, JPMorgan Chase analysts selected Amazon as their \"best idea\" among internet stocks in 2024. More broadly, the stock carries a consensus rating of \"buy\" among Wall Street analysts, and its median one-year price target of $215 per share implies 20% upside from its current price of $179 per share.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk operates the leading independent ad tech platform for media buyers. Its software helps brands and their advertising agencies plan, measure, and optimize digital campaigns. The company has embedded its platform with sophisticated machine learning and measurement capabilities, which help media buyers spend their ad budgets more effectively.\n\nThe Trade Desk's independence -- meaning it does not own media content that could bias its behavior toward specific ad inventory -- has helped the company build trust with media buyers, such that its customer retention rate has exceeded 95% for the past decade. Its independence and scale has also led to partnerships with publishers (media sellers) in ways that would be impossible for competitors like Alphabet's Google.\n\nFor instance, The Trade Desk provides the underlying technology that powers Walmart's ad tech platform, a job that would never be entrusted to a competiting publisher like Google. The Trade Desk also sources data from many more of the world's largest retailers, including Target, Albertsons, and Walgreens, but those publishers are less likely to share information with competitors like Google. The upshot is The Trade Desk has access to robust data that not only affords its platform unique measurement capabilities, but also theoretically gives the company an edge in training the machine learning models that inform decision-making.\n\nThe Trade Desk reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 23% to $606 million and GAAP net income increased 36% to $0.19 per diluted share. On the earnings call, Jeff Green said The Trade Desk has gained market share for eight consecutive quarters, and he expects the company to continue gaining share. Management also guided for revenue growth to accelerate to 25% in the first quarter.\n\nGoing forward, The Trade Desk is well positioned to maintain that momentum due to its strong presence in connected TV advertising and retail media, two of the fastest-growing channels in the broader digital advertising market. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 20.8 times sales is tolerable, especially when the three-year average is 24.9 times sales. But investors should start with a small position.\n\nAs a final thought, The Trade Desk stock carries a consensus rating of \"buy\" among Wall Street analysts, and its median one-year price target of $100 per share implies 24% upside from its current price of $80.50 per share.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Trade Desk is US$61.25 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Trade Desk is estimated to be 26% overvalued based on current share price of US$77.30 The US$94.34 analyst price target for TTD is 54% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nIs Trade Desk Fairly Valued?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$711.2m US$839.8m US$980.7m US$1.09b US$1.17b US$1.25b US$1.31b US$1.37b US$1.42b US$1.47b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x5 Analyst x5 Analyst x3 Est @ 10.66% Est @ 8.15% Est @ 6.39% Est @ 5.16% Est @ 4.30% Est @ 3.70% Est @ 3.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1%  US$670 US$746 US$821 US$856 US$873 US$875 US$867 US$852 US$833 US$811\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.2b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.5b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.1%\u2013 2.3%) = US$39b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$39b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$22b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$30b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$77.3, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Trade Desk as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.830. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Trade Desk\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nCurrently debt free.\n\nWeakness\n\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our articleChatGPT Stock Predictions: 5 Stocks That Have 10X Potential.\n\nFrom taking customer service calls to composing music, AI has already started showing its prowess and impact all over the world. But can AI help investors in spotting potential multibaggers? Several reports show that hedge funds, venture capitalists and wise investors are using AI to their advantage. For example, California-based venture capital firm Sierra Ventures developed an AI software which would help the firm decide whether to invest in a startup. Talking to The Wall Street Journal, the firm's Managing Partner Mark Fernandes said that analysis from this software caused him pay attention to a promising startup that he would have otherwise ignored.\n\n\"If you think about the volume of deals coming in, I would\u2019ve missed that,\" Fernandes said.\n\nHow Can AI Help Investors and Professional Stock Pickers?\n\nMike Wilson, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist & Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley, talked to Bloomberg about the impact of AI on businesses and his broader view on the economy. Wilson said that we are still in the early days of AI when it comes to the business world. He said that the \"real opportunity\" would be when AI is \"diffused\" to the economy and companies begin to adapt to AI technologies. \u00a0Wilson said so far the role of AI has been of an assistant rather than an enabler. But the power of AI in the investing world is fast becoming decisive as the technology helps companies make decisions potentially worth billions of dollars.\n\nIn the investing world, AI has been in action in some form over the past several years, as quant funds and high-performance trading firms rigorously used machine learning for sentiment analysis, finding patterns in stocks and predicting market movements. A research paper titled Artificial Intelligence applied to Stock Market Trading: A Review mentions several studies and academic researches describing the importance of using AI, machine learning and data-based predictive analysis in stock investing. For example, the research mentions a paper which analyzed stock returns when a data mining approach is incorporated where thousands of press releases from companies trading on NYSE and NSADAQ indices were processed.\u00a0 The data-based analysis divided all press relapses in three categories: \"Good News,\" \"Bad News,\" and \"No Movers\" (for neutral news). The paper found out that good news result in significant stock jumps, while bad news cause stock dips. When this sentiment analysis is practiced, \"results show a recall of approximately 60% and a better cumulative return and average return per trade than the random trader in a stock market simulation.\" That's why in a world where data and AI-based analysis is the future, leaving everything to macro movements and randomness won't take an average investor far.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-based Sentiment Analysis on Stocks\n\nThe research paper also analyzed another study in which it pulled about 300,000 posts about Apple stock from investing-focused social media platform StockTwits during 2010-2017. Algorithms were then applied to perform sentiment analysis and compare it with historical price movements during this entire period (stock price data was pulled from Yahoo Finance).\n\n\"For sentiment prediction, the achieved test accuracy was 63.5%, 75.3% recall, and 76.8% precision, and for stock movement prediction, the completed test accuracy was 76.68%, 100% recall, and 69.5% precision,\" the research said. ChatGPT Stock Predictions: Stocks That Have 10X Potential\n\nPerformance and Returns of AI-Powered Funds and Indexes\n\nAmplify Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA: MJ) is up 18% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500 gain of just 4.5%. The fund, powered by IBM Watson platform, uses sentiment analysis, machine learning and quantum computing to process 10 years of historical data, millions of news articles and data points to analyze securities.\u00a0 Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, an equally weighted index of 11 constituent funds using artificial intelligence and machine learning theory in their trading processes, is up 3.9% in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we asked ChatGPT to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff data, that have the potential to grow 10X in the next few years.

But ChatGPT recommended 15 stocks based on \u00a0\"historical trends\" and the \"market landscape\" from various sectors which have \"substantial\" potential over the next few years. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of the end of 2023.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Trade Desk's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 19 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently\n\nA look at the shareholders of The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$2.7b last week. Still, the 31% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Trade Desk.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Trade Desk?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nTrade Desk already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Trade Desk's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Trade Desk is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.5% of shares outstanding. Baillie Gifford & Co. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 4.8% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Jeffrey Green is the owner of 2.8% of the company's shares.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Trade Desk\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nShareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in The Trade Desk, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$1.4b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Trade Desk. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "Don't Sleep On These Other Tremendous Stocks Amid AI Mania",
        "content": "The investment world is buzzing with talk of artificial intelligence (AI), soaring stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and the immense possibilities for other companies. Hey, I am, too -- if you have a minute, take a look at this stealthy AI stock you may have never heard of. But, while everyone is looking one way, it can pay handsomely in the long run to also look elsewhere.\n\nI look for a few criteria in companies to invest in. These include positive cash flow, stock buyback programs, growing revenue, and desirable business models. Booking Holdings(NASDAQ: BKNG) and The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) check all the boxes for me.\n\nIs Booking Holdings a good investment?\n\nThe travel industry is back in full force with the COVID-19 pandemic finally abating. Forecasts expect $927 billion in global travel spending this year and continued growth thereafter, as depicted below. Travel industry statistics\n\nMany people prefer to book directly with the hotel or airline, but others take advantage of sites like Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, and Agoda, all owned by Booking Holdings. A recent study by Self Finance showed that travelers often save significantly on hotels and flights by using third-party booking services, especially when bundling them. Booking also owns the popular restaurant booking app OpenTable and offers short-term rental stays. The company's massive presence in the travel industry is great news for investors.\n\nBooking's business model is excellent. Since it is essentially a software platform with few physical infrastructure needs, the company spends very little on property and equipment, just 1.5% of revenue in 2023. Amazon, which requires trucks, warehouses, and data centers, spent 9% of its revenue on capital expenditures last year and even more in prior years.\n\nThis lean business model allows Booking to generate a 33% free-cash-flow (FCF) margin -- for each revenue dollar, $0.33 goes right into the company's pocket. Over the last 12 months, Booking recorded $7 billion FCF in sales of $21 billion. And Booking doesn't hoard the cash; it returns it to shareholders through stock buybacks. As you can see below, it spent over $10 billion in just over two years, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 15%. BKNG Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nI prefer buybacks to dividends because buybacks aren't taxed to the investor annually like dividends are. Buybacks reduce the outstanding shares, increasing earnings per share and the stock price. This also means that if the stock falls, the company can take more shares off the table for the same investment -- a terrific cushion for long-term investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooking trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30, ahead of Expedia Group's P/E of 24; however, Booking has reduced its average diluted shares outstanding by 15% since January 2022, compared to 6% for Expedia. Booking also posted 25% revenue growth in 2023 compared to just 10% for Expedia.\n\nIt all adds up to Booking being an excellent long-term investment.\n\nIs The Trade Desk stock a good buy?\n\nAdvertising in 2024 is much different than in prior decades because there are so many mediums to consider, like mobile video ads, website displays, and connected television (CTV). CTV refers to any television content streamed through the internet. Advertising on streaming television is essential; The Trade Desk reports that 95% of advertisers will maintain or increase their programmatic CTV budgets in 2024. This will benefit demand-side platforms (DSPs) like The Trade Desk tremendously.\n\nProgrammatic advertising works like this: When a user visits a website or watches a streaming program, the publisher requests bids on the ad space. A DSP like The Trade Desk bids on behalf of its customers and tries to match them with the target audience. It happens instantaneously. Since 2019, the amount advertisers spent using The Trade Desk's platform tripled from $3.1 billion to $9.6 billion, while The Trade Desk's revenue grew from $661 million to $2 billion.\n\nLike Booking Holdings, The Trade Desk is a lean business that is growing FCF and revenue, as depicted below. TTD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company instituted a stock buyback program in 2023 and used $647 million to repurchase shares. The Trade Desk is a younger company and is more high-risk and high-reward than Booking. The stock trades for 22 times sales, which is on the high side, although less than its five-year average. The high valuation is due to the excellent business model, growing industry, and the company's opportunities for expansion. Right now, only 11% of The Trade Desk's revenue comes from outside North America; however, 67% of the world's advertising dollars are spent elsewhere. This is fertile ground for growth. The company is also making inroads with retail advertising, including deals with Walmart, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Target.\n\nGiven the rich valuation, rushing into a full position with The Trade Desk stock is unnecessary. Consider buying a little at a time to take advantage of dips in share price. This is called dollar-cost averaging, and it's excellent for hedging risks.\n\nThe Trade Desk and Booking operate in different industries but share many characteristics that make them attractive long-term investments. If you're looking outside the world of AI, you should consider these two candidates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Why The Trade Desk (TTD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of advertising software maker The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) fell 5.6% in the afternoon session as the major indices declined (Nasdaq down -1.70%, S&P 500 down -1.1%, Dow down -0.61%), while yields soared. Geopolitical tension heightened following reports on Saturday, April 13, 2024, that Iran launched drones and missiles at Israel, driving uncertainty about possible disruption to global trade and commerce should the tension escalate. Also, the Census Bureau report revealed March 2024 retail sales rose 0.7% compared to the previous month (ahead of market expectations for a 0.3% increase), suggesting consumption is strong amidst recent inflation concerns.\n\nPrior to these reports, market volatility had picked up after the March 2024 CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) report revealed inflation came in slightly hotter than expected, adding to fears that the Fed could delay rate cut plans in 2024.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy The Trade Desk? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nThe Trade Desk's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago, when the stock dropped 29.1% on the news that the company reported third quarter results and provided revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance below expectations. Management added that \"we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4.\" The markets have been skittish about the macro, and The Trade Desk is a company heavily tied to macro-sensitive advertising, so the weak outlook may cause alarm.\n\nOn the other hand, its revenue narrowly topped analysts' expectations this quarter. While it was objectively a mixed quarter for The Trade Desk since results were fine, the guidance was weak, and the market seems spooked about the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk is up 15.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $81.36 per share it is still trading 10.9% below its 52-week high of $91.26 from July 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of The Trade Desk's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,031.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "There Are Reasons To Feel Uneasy About Trade Desk's (NASDAQ:TTD) Returns On Capital",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Trade Desk:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.084 = US$200m \u00f7 (US$4.9b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThus, Trade Desk has an ROCE of 8.4%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.8% average generated by the Media industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Trade Desk's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Trade Desk .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Trade Desk's ROCE Trend?\n\nOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Trade Desk doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 27%, but since then they've fallen to 8.4%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nOn a side note, Trade Desk has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 51% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Keep in mind 51% is still pretty high, so those risks are still somewhat prevalent.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line On Trade Desk's ROCE\n\nEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Trade Desk. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 341% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.\n\nTrade Desk could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation for TTD on our platform quite valuable.\n\nWhile Trade Desk may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "content": "The Trade Desk (TTD) closed the latest trading day at $86.68, indicating a +0.99% change from the previous session's end. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.03%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.03%.\n\nThe digital-advertising platform operator's shares have seen an increase of 5.2% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of The Trade Desk in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.22, indicating a 4.35% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $479.63 million, showing a 25.3% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $1.49 per share and a revenue of $2.39 billion, signifying shifts of +18.25% and +22.94%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for The Trade Desk. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. The Trade Desk is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at its valuation, The Trade Desk is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 57.8. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 23.51 of its industry.\n\nInvestors should also note that TTD has a PEG ratio of 2.51 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Internet - Services industry stood at 1.82 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 57, placing it within the top 23% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is The Trade Desk (TTD) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about The Trade Desk (TTD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nThe Trade Desk currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.57, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.57 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for The Trade Desk here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying The Trade Desk, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs TTD Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for The Trade Desk, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $1.49.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for The Trade Desk. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for The Trade Desk.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "From $50 to $50,000: 3 Stocks Under $100 That Could Skyrocket Your Wealth by 2026",
        "content": "InvestorPlace contributor Omor Ibne Ehsan recently recommended three stocks trading under $20, which investors could turn $100 in each of these into $10,000 by 2026. I will double down on that premise, suggesting three stocks under $100 to buy that will make you $50,000 by 2026.\n\nWith a maximum total investment of $300 ($100 per stock), generating a compound annual growth rate of 450% is virtually impossible. It\u2019s more the idea that these three stocks have the revenue and profit potential to deliver supersized returns.\n\nWhere should one look for such stocks?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI\u2019d look at holdings from ETFs focused on aggressive growth, such as the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, a collection of 100 non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq.\n\nHere are my three choices for stocks under $100 to buy.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) is one of the smaller names in the Nasdaq 100, with a market capitalization of $42.68 billion. Its share price, as I write this, is $88, well under the $100 mark.\n\nThe digital advertising platform is the antithesis of Google and Facebook. It\u2019s become so big that its market cap is almost identical to ad agencies Publicis Groupe (OTCMKTS:PUBGY) and Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC).\n\nIt focuses on companies that operate on the \u201copen internet,\u201d not the closed shop that is Google and Facebook. It places digital ads at scale for companies such as Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) in return for a 20% commission on those ads.\n\nHowever, compared to Google\u2019s ad revenue, TTD is a blip on the radar.\n\n\u201cGlobal ad spending is approaching $1trn. Just $10bn of that, or 1%, went through ttd last year. Google\u2019s revenues, mostly from digital ads, were a stonking $307bn,\u201d The Economist\u2019s March 27 edition of Schumpeter stated.\n\nThere are risks associated with targeting streaming platforms and other subscription-type apps that rely on limited ads to grow revenues. The biggest risk being that a platform\u2019s audience falls significantly, reducing the value of The Trade Desk\u2019s service and commission rate. However, it\u2019s a business model that appears to be working.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the last three years, its revenues have grown by 63% to $1.95 billion. During this time period its operating income has increased 61% to $200.5 million.\n\nIt\u2019s got a shot.\n\nCopart (CPRT) Image of a hand holding a wooden hammer at an auction.\n\nSource: Gena Melendrez / Shutterstock.com\n\nCopart (NASDAQ:CPRT) earns money from online vehicle auctions conducted in 11 countries including the U.S. and Canada.\u00a0 It sells more than three million vehicles annually to customers in more than 190 countries. Its market cap is more than $13 billion higher than The Trade Desk.\n\nIn March, Copart celebrated its 30th year as a public company. Since its IPO in March 1994, its shares have appreciated more than 36,000%.\n\nCopart owns the real estate on which its facilities are operated, keeping it at the forefront of the online auction business, even when it might be cheaper to lease the land.\n\n\u201cFor example, at any given moment, it is \u201ccheaper\u201d to lease than to buy the facilities through which we serve our customers.\u201d Co-CEOs Jay Adair and Jeff Liaw stated in Copart\u2019s 2023 letter to shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe know, however, given how difficult it is to permit and develop new facilities, facility ownership is essential to ensuring the long-run sustainability of our service offerings.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Copart has invested more than $2 billion over the past five years in buying and developing land. So, it\u2019s not just in the online auction business; it\u2019s also in real estate development, etc.\n\nWhile it might not reach $50,000 by 2026, you\u2019ll do very well over the long haul.\n\nCoStar Group (CSGP) An image of a magnifying glass zooming in on the CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP) logo\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is the smallest of the three, with a market cap of $39 billion. As I write this, its share price just squeeks in at $94.75.\n\nIts shares have delivered decent performance over the past five years, up nearly double, at a time when the commercial real estate business, especially the office segment, has suffered greatly from an increase in work-from-home and hybrid work arrangements.\n\nCoStar provides real estate data and data analytics to the industry. The recent settlement between the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and class-action plaintiffs should be good news for the company because residential real estate brokers won\u2019t be required to go through the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) to list a home.\n\nThe company has seen double-digit quarterly sales growth for three years, and recent good news should sustain this trend.\n\nOn March 25, RBC Capital Markets increased its target price on CSGP stock by 15% to $109. It maintains an outperform rating on the stock. RBC liked the news that the company\u2019s Homes.com residential real estate platform saw a 29% week-over-week increase in premium agents \u2014 defined as the top 25% of agents \u2014 to approximately 5,276.\n\nWith the changes in agent commissions related to the NAR settlement, CoStar is likely to gain more premium agents.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the software industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Software Companies in the US.\n\nAn Overview of the Global Software Industry\n\nThe software industry has become an integral part of our modern world.

        "content": "It's almost the end of the first quarter of the calendar year, and the good news for investors is that the S&P 500 index has delivered steady gains of 9% in 2024. More importantly, the stock market seems set for more upside as the year progresses thanks to strong earnings performances from major names in the index.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts have been quickly raising their forecasts about where the S&P 500 could be at the end of the year. Bank of America now expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,400 by the end of 2024 as compared to its earlier forecast of 5,000. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast to 5,200 last month from 4,700 in December, but it looks like the investment bank will have to further raise its expectations as the index is already past that mark.\n\nThis broader stock market rally is going to be a big tailwind for the likes of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), and Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU). All three companies are benefiting from a major catalyst that could help them maintain impressive levels of growth in 2024 and beyond.\n\nLet's look at the reasons all three stocks are likely to head higher as the year progresses.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia stock has delivered impressive gains of 87% in 2024 as of this writing. And it still has the potential to deliver more gains this year thanks to its aggressive product road map that should allow it to maintain its dominance in the lucrative artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nNvidia estimates that data centers are on track to spend $250 billion this year on accelerated computing chips like the graphics processing units (GPUs) that the company sells.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang says this addressable revenue opportunity in data centers is growing at an annual pace of 25%. Nvidia sold $47.5 billion worth of data center chips in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year).\n\nIts revenue from this segment more than tripled year over year in fiscal 2024. And the massive revenue opportunity that Huang sees means that the company's data center business still has a lot of room for growth, especially considering that it reportedly has a near monopoly in the AI chip market with an estimated market share of 95%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs later this year could help Nvidia maintain its tight grip over this market. The upcoming chips are four times faster than the current-generation Hopper chips for AI training, and they are said to be 30 times faster in AI inference workloads.\n\nThe new graphics cards are reportedly going to be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which would be a bump from the $20,000 to $30,000 price range of the current H100 graphics cards. Given that these new chips reportedly cost $6,000 to manufacture, Nvidia is likely to make a solid profit on its next-generation AI chips.\n\nAll this explains why 10 analysts have raised their earnings estimate for the current fiscal year in the past month. The company is expected to finish the year with $22.73 per share in earnings as compared to $12.96 last year.\n\nAs a result, there is a strong probability of Nvidia stock heading higher in 2024 thanks to its improved pricing power, which is why it would be a good idea to buy this AI stock right now at 35 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average of 39.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk stock is up 21% this year, and there is a good chance it could end 2024 with much stronger gains. The company's growth is accelerating due to higher spending on digital advertising as well as the increasing adoption of its programmatic advertising platform.\n\nThere is robust demand for The Trade Desk's AI-enabled cloud-based platform because it allows marketers to purchase ad inventory, create campaigns, and optimize them using real-time data to drive stronger returns on the ad dollars spent. That led to a 23% year-over-year increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $606 million.\n\nThe Trade Desk's guidance of $478 million in revenue for the current quarter means that its top line is on track to jump 25% compared to the year-ago period. That would be an improvement over the growth it delivered in the previous quarter.\n\nIt is not surprising to see why The Trade Desk is witnessing an acceleration in growth. According to the analytical firm eMarketer, programmatic ad spending is expected to grow at three times the pace of nonprogrammatic spending. More specifically, the firm expects programmatic ad spending in the U.S. to increase by almost 16% in 2024, up from 11.4% last year.\n\nThe reason behind the faster growth in programmatic ad spending is that this method of advertising automates the media buying process with the help of real-time data. Advertisers can bid for ad inventory in real time to keep their costs low and display their ads across different channels depending on where they can improve audience targeting.\n\nThe Trade Desk, therefore, could end 2024 with stronger revenue growth as compared to the 23% top-line jump it delivered last year to $1.95 billion. Investors looking for a growth stock would do well to buy its shares right now because it seems built for more upside in 2024.\n\n3. Micron Technology\n\nShares of Micron Technology have jumped 39% this year, and the company's latest results suggest that its bull run is just getting started. The memory specialist crushed Wall Street's expectations in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Feb. 29) with $5.8 billion in revenue and $0.42 per share in adjusted earnings.\n\nConsensus estimates were projecting a loss of $0.25 per share on $5.35 billion in revenue. Micron, however, posted a surprise profit as its top line jumped 58% year over year.\n\nAnd the $6.6 billion revenue estimate for the current quarter indicates that its top line is on track to increase at a faster pace of 76% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe massive increases in the chipmaker's top and bottom lines stem from the improvement in the memory-chip market's dynamics. According to Micron, \"the supply-demand balance tightened\" in the memory industry last quarter, driven by strong demand from AI servers and improving conditions in the personal computer (PC) and smartphone markets.\n\nAnd supply reductions by memory manufacturers should ensure that Micron continues to take advantage of a strong pricing environment.\n\nIn all, the memory industry is expected to generate nearly $130 billion in revenue in 2024, up 45% from last year, according to Statista.\n\nAs a result, analysts are forecasting a 56% increase in Micron's revenue this year to $24 billion, followed by another jump of 43% in fiscal 2025 to $34.5 billion. This tremendous revenue growth should also translate into stronger earnings power, which is why it would be a good idea to buy shares before they soar higher following its post-earnings pop.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Is Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock",
        "content": "Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could soon face a reckoning. In March, she wrote:\n\nWithout an explosion in software revenue to justify the overbuilding of GPU capacity, we would not be surprised to see a pause in spending, compounding a correction in excess inventories, particularly among the cloud customers that account for more than half of Nvidia's data center sales.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean Nvidia is a bad investment. The company has navigated supply gluts in the past, and the stock has always rebounded. But Ark Invest sees better opportunities elsewhere. So Wood and her team continued to sell shares of Nvidia throughout March, while redeploying capital in The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), another company that stands to benefit from artificial intelligence.\n\nHere's what investors should know about the ad tech company.\n\nThe Trade Desk is the leading independent platform for media buyers\n\nThe Trade Desk operates the largest independent, demand-side platform, a type of ad tech software that helps media buyers plan, measure, and optimize data-driven campaigns across digital channels. Its platform features what management sees as industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and measurement capabilities, both of which help media buyers realize greater returns on ad spending.\n\nThe Trade Desk has a particularly strong presence in connected TV (CTV) and retail media, two of the fastest-growing advertising channels. In fact, Forrester Research recently said The Trade Desk dominates the CTV advertising space, and Morgan Stanley believes the company will \"ultimately be a leader in offsite retail-media advertising\" due to its independent business model and growing list of retail partners.\n\nTo elaborate, the term independent means The Trade Desk is not affiliated with any websites or mobile apps, so it has no reason to steer advertisers toward specific inventory. By comparison, Alphabet's Google has constructed an advertising ecosystem rife with conflicts of interest. It sells ad tech software to third-party media buyers and publishers, while simultaneously selling its own inventory from properties like Google Search and YouTube.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat means Google has a clear incentive to direct ad buyers toward specific inventory, and the company also competes against its own customers. The upshot of those conflicts is that brands are more willing to share data with an independent player like The Trade Desk. The company has used that advantage to embed its platform with robust AI and measurement capabilities.\n\nSpecifically, The Trade Desk sources data from numerous leading retailers to create measurement opportunities not available on other platforms. Its lineup of partners includes Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, and Albertsons, all of which rank among the ten largest retailers in the world. The unique data sourced from those retailers also lays the foundation for superior AI, simply because data is a limiting factor in training machine learning models.\n\nThe Trade Desk gained market share in the fourth quarter\n\nThe Trade Desk reported strong results in the fourth quarter. Customer retention remained over 95% for the tenth consecutive year, revenue rose 23% to $606 million, and net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) increased 36% to $0.19 per diluted share. CEO Jeff Green told analysts, \"We outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last eight quarters.\" He also said the company was uniquely positioned to continue gaining share not just in 2024, but also well into the future.\n\nThe Trade Desk launched a new platform called Kokai last June. It features a more advanced AI engine that synthesizes signals across 13 million impressions per second to help advertisers buy the right impression to reach the right audience at the right time. Kokai also incorporates new measurement capabilities that let advertisers assess retail-campaign performance and CTV ad quality.\n\nUltimately, Kokai should reduce friction and improve campaign outcomes for advertisers. That value proposition should bring more media buyers to The Trade Desk and help the company capture a greater portion of advertising budgets.\n\nThe Trade Desk stock is not cheap, but the price is tolerable\n\nDigital ad spending is forecasted to increase at 15.5% annually through 2030, but The Trade Desk should grow more quickly given its strong presence in the quickly expanding CTV and retail-media channels. The company also believes it can accelerate growth in international markets. That is noteworthy because North America currently accounts for 88% of ad spending on the platform.\n\nWith that in mind, Wall Street analysts expect The Trade Desk to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.4 times sales seem tolerable, though certainly not cheap. Investors should expect volatility in the near term, but The Trade Desk could create significant shareholder value in the long run. Now is a good time to buy a small position in this growth stock.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "2024 is shaping up to be another banner year for tech stocks.\n\nAfter the Nasdaq Composite jumped 43% in 2023 with an even bigger gain in the Nasdaq-100, the Nasdaq Composite is up 9% in 2024 as the first quarter winds down.\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom is the main reason tech stocks are still soaring, but it's not the only reason behind this sector's booming gains. Keep reading to see three tech stocks that look like great buys right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nYou don't get points for originality in the stock market, and while Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may seem like one of the more obvious choices right now, that doesn't make it a bad buy.\n\nThe tech giant has outfoxed its rivals and emerged as the software leader in AI, at least for now. By partnering with OpenAI, Microsoft has been able to add generative AI technology to a wide range of products, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, GitHub code repository, and Office software suite, and those efforts are already paying off. Management said in the most recent quarter that six points of growth in Azure came from AI services, driving the overall category up 30%, which was much faster than Amazon Web Services.\n\nMicrosoft also just hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman from Alphabet, which seems likely to extend its lead in AI. Suleyman also co-founded Inflection AI, which recently folded; Microsoft hired most of its employees.\n\nAdditionally, no other tech giant has the diversification to capitalize on the opportunity in AI.\n\n2. ACM Research\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) is a little-known, small-cap semiconductor company that makes highly specialized wafer-cleaning equipment. These machines play an essential role in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe company sells mostly to customers in China, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which accounted for 16.5% of revenue last year.\n\nLike other semiconductor stocks, ACM has started to see a tailwind from artificial intelligence. The company said that demand for its products was strong in the most recent quarter as it gained market share in the Chinese wafer fab equipment market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue was up 43% and profits surged as well, with adjusted net income more than doubling to $28.7 million. As demand for the advanced chips that artificial intelligence depends on increases, so should demand for ACM's cleaning equipment.\n\nAdditionally, the stock is inexpensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18. This low entry point sets it up for further gains.\n\n3. The Trade Desk\n\nFinally, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is another great tech stock to buy right now.\n\nThe Trade Desk is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the adtech industry. The company provides a self-serve, cloud-based platform for ad agencies and brands to manage their ad campaigns, and it looks set to benefit from a number of trends this year.\n\nFirst, the company is tapping into the power of AI with the launch of its new Kokai AI platform, which leverages deep learning algorithms throughout the digital media buying process, taking advantage of 13 million advertising impressions per second.\n\nAdditionally, The Trade Desk benefits from a recovery in the digital ad market after a lull in 2022 and 2023 on fears of a recession, meaning revenue growth should accelerate from secular tailwinds. Finally, The Trade Desk looks well-positioned to capitalize on Google Chrome's phasing out of third-party cookies, which should help its alternate tracking solution, Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) gain market share. UID2 has already signed up some of the biggest advertisers in the world, including Disney and Procter & Gamble.\n\nThe Trade Desk is also growing rapidly and is highly profitable. The stock has a long track record of outperformance and that trend should continue in the coming years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here is what you need to know about these three tech-focused stocks.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nSemiconductors are red hot on Wall Street right now, and for good reason. Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to become a multitrillion-dollar business over the next decade.\n\nSemiconductors are the building blocks of this technology because they power the intense computing used to train AI models. Nvidia gets most of the hype as the market leader, which leaves room for AMD to shine over the coming years.\n\nAMD unveiled its MI300 AI chip at the end of last year, and the company hopes it will carve out market share. CEO Lisa Su said she believes the industry will grow to $400 billion within a few years. For reference, market leader Nvidia's total revenue over the past year is $61 billion.\n\nThat's a big pie, and AMD doesn't need a huge slice to generate tremendous growth for investors. Its data center revenue was $6.5 billion in all of 2023.\n\nEven a 10% share of a $400 billion AI chip market would grow AMD's data center unit severalfold. Meanwhile, the stock trades at just under 50 times earnings, which isn't a bad valuation for a company that analysts believe will grow earnings by 44% annually over the next three to five years. Consider AMD an underdog AI investment that doesn't need a lot of market share to reward investors.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nJust about anything that talks to a network, whether a phone, computer, or other machine, has a Broadcom chip. The company is the king of connectivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom isn't going to put up the monster growth that AI chip companies are seeing right now, but this semiconductor company did notch 8% revenue growth in 2023. It is more diversified, with a full suite of IT infrastructure and software services it sells to enterprises.\n\nSpecifically, management is excited about the shot in the arm VMware provides. Broadcom acquired it for $69 billion in a deal that closed in November.\n\nBroadcom's annual revenue was almost $36 billion in 2023, but management is guiding for a big jump to $50 billion this year, due mainly to VMware's presence. The world is becoming increasingly connected, which bodes well for long-term demand for Broadcom's chips. Successful sales of its IT solutions could mean investors are in for years of steady growth.\n\nToday, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and analysts are looking for long-term annualized earnings growth of 14%. That makes shares a touch expensive at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2, but investors also get the bonus of a dividend that management has aggressively raised over the years. Broadcom's payout has increased for 14 consecutive years, and the average raise has been 41% over the past five years.\n\n3. The Trade Desk\n\nDespite being the youngest company on this list, The Trade Desk is no slouch. It plays in digital advertising, an industry that is slowly and steadily taking ad dollars away from legacy media formats like print and broadcast television.\n\nEverything is moving online, to apps, and to streaming, where the Trade Desk shines. It's a demand-side ad exchange where brands can autonomously purchase advertisement inventory.\n\nThe Trade Desk is exceptional because it competes with huge companies like Meta Platforms and Alphabet. However, these tech leaders don't share information with advertisers and tell brands what they think they need to know. The Trade Desk is an open book with advertisers, which appeals to them because they know they're getting full transparency.\n\nThe company's steady, profitable growth has earned the stock quite a premium. Shares trade for more than 57 times this year's earnings, and analysts project 20% annualized earnings growth over the coming years. That's a steep PEG ratio of nearly 3, so investors should consider dollar-cost averaging into shares or wait until some market volatility drops the stock to a more attractive entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "It's officially a new bull market, and while artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have emerged as the biggest winners, there are other sectors that look primed to deliver significant gains as well.\n\nWith interest rates expected to fall, the U.S. economy looking resilient, and the consumer continuing to spend, now is a great time to invest. Keep reading to see two stocks that could turn $100,000 into $500,000 over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Perion Network\n\nAs a small-cap stock, Perion Network (NASDAQ: PERI) isn't a household name among investors, but it's worth getting to know this adtech stock.\n\nPerion occupies a unique space in the adtech industry. Its core product is its Intelligent HUB, a machine learning-based platform that connects ad buyers and sellers to optimize transactions and return on investment. As the business has scaled, the company has added a number of new products, including a cookieless tracking solution, called SORT, and premium ad features in connected TV (CTV) and retail media like a scannable QR code on CTV ads and live contextual ads that can run during games and other live events. The company also recently introduced an audio AI technology, WAVE, that can create customizable ads for radio and podcasts.\n\nPerion aims to grow both organically and through acquisitions, and it recently acquired Hivestack, a digital out-of-home adtech company, tapping into the fast-growing corner of the ad market. The company plans to do more acquisitions to gain scale and enter new parts of the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to deliver solid growth with revenue up 12% in the fourth quarter to $234.2 million, while adjusted earnings per share rose $1.04. Perion saw strong growth in retail media, where revenue was up 114% to $49.7 million thanks to its premium ad products.\n\nFinally, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 9.6, which seems like a dirt-cheap price to pay for this growth stock. With a valuation that low and the potential for breakout growth, Perion has the potential to grow by 10 times over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nAnother promising adtech stock to help you build a nest egg of $500,000 over time is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). The Trade Desk is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP). It offers a cloud-based, self-serve platform that brands and ad agencies use to manage their ad campaigns.\n\nThe Trade Desk has a long track record of outperforming the market and has been the trendsetter in its industry with technologies like Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), a popular cookieless tracking technology that some of the biggest advertisers, like Disney and Procter & Gamble, have adopted. Additionally, the company has invested significantly in artificial intelligence to develop its Kokai platform, which is expected to be released to most customers this year.\n\nThe Trade Desk has also delivered solid growth during a challenging time in the digital-advertising industry, showing the company was able to gain market share even as advertisers pulled back on spending.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue rose 23% to $1.95 billion, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved from $245 million to $284 million. The Trade Desk also has a history of satisfying its customers, as it's reported a customer retention rate of 95% in every quarter of its last nine years.\n\nWith market-leading positions and technologies, strong business fundamentals, and its technological advantage, The Trade Desk looks like a great stock for long-term wealth building.\n\nLike Perion Network, The Trade Desk also has the potential to deliver multibagger returns over the coming years, especially as it's likely to benefit from a recovery in the ad market.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and The Trade Desk made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 21, 2024\n\nJeremy Bowman has positions in Perion Network and The Trade Desk.

        "title": "3 Hot Stocks Cathie Wood Bought Last Week",
        "content": "Cathie Wood was busy last week. The CEO, co-founder, and primary stock picker for the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) made several portfolio moves. Ark publishes its portfolio transactions daily, giving investors refreshing transparency into what the widely followed money manager is doing.\n\nWhat is Wood adding to her portfolios these days? She added to her stakes in UiPath (NYSE: PATH), The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), and Nu (NYSE: NU) last week. What does she see in these three stocks that have risen by more than 70% since the start of last year? Let's take a closer look.\n\nUiPath\n\nThe case for embracing robotics in the workplace keeps getting louder. Human labor costs are rising. The global manpower shortages during the pandemic were a wake-up call for leaning on the efficiencies and reliability of automation. As a leader in cloud-first software solutions for robotics and automation, UiPath is a tale of two starting lines.\n\nUiPath is technically a broken IPO, trading for less than half of the $56 a share it went public at three years ago. However, momentum has turned positive. The stock has more than doubled since bottoming out 14 months ago. Wood was a buyer of the stock in three of her ETFs on Thursday after providing a financial update, and this was after lightening her stake in two other ETFs earlier in the week. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUiPath posted record financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Wednesday afternoon. Revenue rose a better-than-expected 31%. Its adjusted operating margin widened substantially as fiscal 2024 played out, and UiPath scored its first quarterly profit on a reported basis as a public company. The shares initially shot higher on the report, but the stock would drift to close 7% lower on Thursday. Wood was a buyer despite the downticks. It's a sharp contrast to the 27% surge in share price that shareholders experienced after its previous quarterly update.\n\nThere is still a lot to like at UiPath. Revenue growth picked up the pace in fiscal 2024 after back-to-back years of sharp deceleration. Revenue growth accelerated in each of the four quarters of the fiscal year. With a dollar-based net retention rate of 119% -- meaning that returning customers are spending 19% more than they were a year earlier -- customers find new ways to lean on UiPath's platform. Its annualized renewal run rate gets stronger the larger the customer. UiPath is also a leader in incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics and automation, an emphasis that continues to excite growth investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nAdvertising may not seem like a growth industry, but The Trade Desk's leadership position in programmatic advertising -- where algorithms help allocate marketing budgets -- is resilient. The Trade Desk has posted eight consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth, a major accomplishment in an industry that has its share of ups and downs.\n\nThe adtech bellwether saw its shares soar 17% the day it posted well-received financial results last month. Revenue rose 23%, ahead of market expectations. It was a rare miss on the bottom line for The Trade Desk, but guidance boosted investor enthusiasm in the stock. The Trade Desk sees its top line clocking in with a 25% year-over-year increase for the current quarter, a welcome sign of acceleration.\n\nNu\n\nThe hottest of the three stocks in this list is Nu. The parent company of Latin America's Nubank has nearly tripled since the start of last year. Nubank wasn't even around 11 years ago, and now more than half of Brazil has a financial relationship with the bankless fintech speedster.\n\nRevenue rose 57% in its latest quarter with adjusted net income more than tripling. If you're not a fan of \"adjusted\" earnings, I buried the lede. Reported net income skyrocketed nearly sixfold. Despite its rapid growth, Nu has managed to post six straight quarters of reported profitability.\n\nUiPath, The Trade Desk, and Nu were strong growth stock additions to Wood's shopping list last week. Let's see what she buys this week.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nTech: A High-Growth Sector\n\nIf you're looking for high growth stocks to invest in, the tech sector is one of the best places to start. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be exceptional additions to any growth portfolios as this revolutionary technology continues to expand and grow to bigger heights than ever seen before. However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.\n\nOn March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.\"\n\nWinners in Artificial Intelligence in 2024\n\nAccording to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:\n\n\"Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThese \"winning\" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:\n\n\"I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.\"\n\nInvestors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world. Additionally, keeping up with the news on which AI stocks can reasonably be considered high growth stocks is also important at this point in time. As such, we have compiled a list of the fastest-growing AI stocks today, including some of the most promising AI stocks to buy and some of the most advanced AI companies to invest in. 11 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now\n\nPhoto by Maximalfocus on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the high growth stocks for our list below by consulting the holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF and shortlisting 11 stocks with the highest share price gains over a 5-year period as of March 16.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Technology Stocks to Take You From Next to Nothing to $500,000 and Beyond",
        "content": "Finding quality stocks to buy isn't too terribly tough for most investors. Finding stocks that could turn practically nothing into half a million bucks within one lifetime, however, does have its challenges.\n\nPotential candidates are likely to be found within the tech sector, since technology is ultimately at the heart of most major sociocultural advancements. But these companies must also be able to adapt products and services that are perpetually in demand. This criterion narrows the list of possibilities quite a bit.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three technology stocks that -- given enough time -- have a great shot at turning next to nothing into $500,000, if not more.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nYou most likely know Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) as a maker of computer graphics tech. Its stand-alone GPUs (graphics processing units) are a favorite among video gaming enthusiasts, although the company also offers display solutions for PCs without graphics cards.\n\nComputer displays aren't its biggest business anymore, however -- not even close. Last year, data center processing solutions accounted for over three-fourths of the company's revenue. By and large, these data centers are using Nvidia's hardware in artificial intelligence applications. As it turns out, the same computer architecture that makes for high-performance graphics cards is also perfectly suited to handle the heavy-duty data loads inherent in AI! That's why Nvidia has been making purpose-built artificial intelligence hardware for a while now. And that's why Nvidia is believed to now control the vast majority of the AI hardware market.\n\nProblem? Investors keeping close tabs on Nvidia probably already know that. With its market cap of well over $2 trillion, this company is now a regular contender for the honor of being the world's biggest. This sheer size, however, also seemingly limits its potential upside. How big can a corporation realistically get?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe thing is, there is no actual limit to Nvidia's potential size. Those are purely mental constructs. That's particularly true in light of the fact that the world's still only scratched the surface of its use of AI. An outlook from Precedence Research suggests the worldwide AI market is set to grow an average of 19% per year through 2032, while Mordor Intelligence says the AI computing hardware market alone will likely grow at an annualized pace of 26% through 2029. Both predictions of course bode well for Nvidia.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is anything but a household name. But there's a good chance you or someone in your household is regularly impacted by its service.\n\nIn simplest terms, The Trade Desk helps companies advertise more effectively, particularly as it pertains to digital advertising. From ad-supported streaming to billboards to conventional web ads, The Trade Desk is a one-stop shop for getting your message in front of consumers. Just as important, the company helps advertisers better target specific audiences and monitor the success of ad campaigns. It even integrates its platform with other, comparable advertising-support and data-monitoring services.\n\nIt's not exactly a brand new idea. Companies have sought to fine-tune their advertising for decades now. It didn't take long for advertisers to do the same shortly after the internet itself was identified as a viable advertising medium.\n\nThe Trade Desk arguably does it better than most, if not all, competitors in this space. Quadrant Knowledge Solutions identified The Trade Desk as 2023's top advertising technology provider, putting it ahead of competitors like Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and Adobe. IT research and consultancy Gartner also regularly ranks The Trade Desk as a leader within the ad-tech space, again placing it on par with Adobe, Google, and Amazon.\n\nThis powerful platform is the chief reason the company's revenue is expected to climb nearly 23% this year and almost another 20% next year. Earnings are growing even more, from last year's $1.26 per share to an expected $1.47 this year to a projected $1.76 per share next year.\n\nThis might help seal the deal: The Trade Desk is doing well, but the stock remains well below analysts' estimates of its worth. Most analysts rate shares as a strong buy at this time, with its consensus price target of $97.85 being more than 20% above the stock's present price.\n\n3. IonQ\n\nLast but not least, add IonQ(NYSE: IONQ) to your list of unstoppable technology stocks that could take you from zero to half a million dollars in a relatively modest amount of time.\n\nMost investors have likely heard the term \"quantum computing.\" But most investors would also be pretty hard-pressed to name a single publicly traded company working on this revolutionary computing technology. IonQ is one of the few. Using ionized ytterbium atoms as the basis for its computing platforms, the company can offer computational solutions that couldn't even be conceived with the use of more conventional, silicon-based hardware. For perspective, quantum computes are on the order of 100 million times faster than the type of computers you may use at home or at work.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily make them better for all purposes. Quantum computers aren't practical for most ordinary uses like browsing the internet or playing a video game, for instance. They're only well suited for handling complex calculations like those needed to be done by AI or drug development platforms. They may also be able to handle jobs like financial modeling or cybersecurity, which aren't necessarily data-intensive but are still complicated, multifaceted tasks.\n\nInvestors must understand that these solutions are no longer merely theoretical, or even in a beta-testing stage. They're real. IonQ's quantum computers are now commercialized. The company booked $22 million worth of revenue last year, and it is expected to report $39 million this year en route to nearly $81 million worth of sales in 2025.\n\nThe company's not yet profitable, for the record, and probably won't be in the foreseeable future. That's a risk to consider simply because unprofitable companies often make for volatile, unpredictable stocks.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean IonQ shares won't perform well in the future, particularly as more investors start seeing the company's opportunity in the quantum computing space. Precedence Research suggests this market will grow an average of 37% through 2030, when it's expected to be worth $125 billion per year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 14% over the last month. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Trade Desk's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:\n\n8.3% = US$179m \u00f7 US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nTrade Desk's Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Trade Desk's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 10.0%, we may spare it some thought. Having said that, Trade Desk's net income growth over the past five years is more or less flat. Bear in mind, the company's ROE is not very high. So that could also be one of the reasons behind the company's flat growth in earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Trade Desk's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 13% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Trade Desk's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Trade Desk Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nTrade Desk doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Trade Desk can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "There's no doubt that Nvidia is the stock everyone's talking about right now. And I won't say Nvidia doesn't deserve its flowers. However, investing is sometimes about moving against the crowd, looking for the gem everyone else is overlooking.\n\nSo instead of homing in on Nvidia like everyone else is, consider looking at some great growth stocks that are not only using artificial intelligence (AI) effectively, but have overlooked fundamentals and valuations that could set up investors for stellar long-term investment returns.\n\nHere are two AI stocks you need to have on your radar:\n\n1. The Trade Desk\n\nOk, it might be a stretch to say that ad-tech standout The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is overlooked. After all, shares are up over 50% over the past year. But when was the last time your Uncle Bob asked you about the stock? The company doesn't get nearly the hype it deserves. Founder Jeff Green is a pioneer in digital advertising and has built a growing and highly profitable business with a straightforward proposition to advertisers:\n\nIndustry giants like Meta Platforms and Alphabet operate in closed ecosystems. In other words, you pay them for an ad. They will use their data, tell you how they believe the ad performed, and not give you much transparency about how they arrived at these conclusions. The Trade Desk offers advertisers complete insight so customers can feel good about spending money on the platform. Approximately 95% of customers stick around after working with The Trade Desk.\n\nThe Trade Desk uses AI to match advertisements to their ideal audience. It's an asset-light (and profitable) business model that keeps growing: TTD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nLong-term growth could come from a combination of brands diversifying away from the major ad platforms, plus a broader shift of advertising budgets from print and broadcast media to online. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by an average of 23% annually over the next three to five years. That's solid growth for today's forward P/E ratio of 56.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk is a potential blue-chip technology stock in the making.\n\n2. SentinelOne\n\nCybersecurity is at the epicenter of the modern economy. It doesn't take long to find news of a significant breach. Healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group was just recently hacked, for example, and is trying to control the fallout from that. Incidents like this will probably ensure security remains a high priority for corporate budgets for years to come. Why not put your money on SentinelOne(NYSE: S), arguably one of the most innovative stocks in the space?\n\nSentinelOne started in endpoint security, securing devices connected to a network. However, since then the company has expanded to other areas like cloud and identity security.\n\nSentinelOne's tech works like this: Artificial intelligence organizes everything your device does into trends and stories. When something looks out of line -- boom, it seizes it and addresses the threat if necessary. It's autonomous and proactive protection.\n\nThe company's product has gotten numerous accolades from third-party tech evaluators like Gartner, and SentinelOne is rapidly growing its business, too: S Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nSentinelOne is still early in its business life. The company is only doing about $573 million in annual revenue and isn't profitable yet. However, that's all changing fast. Analysts believe revenue will hit $1 billion in two years, while free cash flow is quickly heading toward positive territory. The business has a tremendous $800 million cash hoard to keep investing in growth and zero debt.\n\nIf you value the stock on sales, its price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 10 is nearly half that of its arch-rival CrowdStrike Holdings. Since CrowdStrike is profitable, one could argue that SentinelOne could close that gap in the stocks' valuations once it follows suit. There's much to like between that potential catalyst and a healthy growth outlook.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

To skip our detailed analysis of the cloud computing industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cloud Computing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThroughout 2023, the information technology sector consistently surpassed both investor and analyst expectations. Innovations like artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI emerged as key drivers of the tech rally, propelling stock prices for tech companies to unprecedented levels. While AI certainly commands attention in the current year, it's not the only tech frontier worth investors' focus. Cloud computing stands out as another compelling area for development and investment. With individuals, corporations, and governments globally transitioning towards a more digital landscape, the potential of cloud computing is increasingly promising.\n\nCloud computing experienced significant growth during the 2010s, but the expansion of this next-generation IT industry is still in its early stages. Over the years, organizations worldwide have been transitioning their operations to the cloud, storing digital data and services in remote data centers and accessing them via the Internet. However, the surge in remote work during the pandemic hastened this trend. Now, the emergence of generative AI is driving the next wave of cloud expansion. According to tech researcher Gartner, global spending on cloud computing, which includes data center infrastructure and edge computing, was projected to surge to $600 billion in 2023, with an estimated rise to $725 billion in 2024.\n\nGiven these dynamics, cloud computing stocks like Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stand out as premier investments in the tech sector, drawing significant interest from both individual investors and hedge funds. As the industry's expansion continues to gather momentum, we've curated a list of the best cloud computing stocks to aid investors in identifying promising opportunities.

At the company\u2019s investor day in late September, management provided medium-term annual revenue guidance of 17-19%.

        "content": "In the last year, many The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nTrade Desk Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Lead Independent Director, Lise Buyer, for US$1.5m worth of shares, at about US$75.20 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$82.19, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 16% of Lise Buyer's holding.\n\nTrade Desk insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At Trade Desk Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Trade Desk. In total, Executive VP Samantha Jacobson dumped US$519k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Trade Desk\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Trade Desk insiders own 3.6% of the company, currently worth about US$1.4b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Trade Desk Insiders?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Trade Desk stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Trade Desk is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREEreport showing analyst forecasts for Trade Desk.\n\nOf course Trade Desk may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Buy These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead.",
        "content": "Without a doubt, many artificial intelligence (AI) investors are kicking themselves for missing out on Nvidia's big gains. With the stock up 280% in the last year and over 1,800% in five years, it is one of the major beneficiaries in the AI space.\n\nNonetheless, Nvidia is not the only AI stock in the chip industry, and AI is so much more than semiconductors. With the breadth of AI investing options, the industry should continue to bring opportunity. Three Fool.com contributors have ideas on where AI investors can look next: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nAmazon has many ways to win when it comes to AI\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): There are hotter AI stocks out there, but Amazon remains one worth watching, and buying. Here's why:\n\nFirst, the company is the largest cloud services provider. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is estimated to have about 31% of the worldwide cloud services market. That's important because new generative AI tools and applications often utilize cloud services like AWS. As the AI revolution rolls on, Amazon is poised to profit thanks to its lead in the cloud infrastructure market.\n\nSecond, Amazon's massive e-commerce business dovetails nicely with many different AI applications. For example, the company has already introduced Rufus, a new AI-powered shopping assistant designed to help people by answering questions, making pricing comparisons, and generating product recommendations.\n\nIn addition, Amazon is using AI in many other areas of its operations, such as:\n\nStreamlining prescription drug delivery time and cost through Amazon Pharmacy. Lowering the company's environmental impact through AI-generated recommendations to reduce packaging use. Improving shopping recommendations via Amazon Fashion. Updating Alexa-enabled devices to enhance conversation and dialogue between users and Alexa.\n\nOn top of all of that, Amazon remains one of the world's best-run companies. Shares are up 73% over the last 12 months, while revenue growth has bounced back to a solid 13%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, Amazon remains a smart choice for AI-focused investors.\n\nThe Trade Desk benefits from AI and digital advertising tailwinds\n\nJustin Pope (The Trade Desk): Artificial intelligence is a hot topic today, but it began disrupting the advertising business several years back when The Trade Desk was in its infancy. Brands and other companies can buy advertising on The Trade Desk's platform, which uses AI and user data to match ads to potential customers. This is far more effective than traditional advertising, which would broadcast to broad audiences on television, radio, or in print.\n\nThe Trade Desk has thrived, growing profitably since its 2016 initial public offering. The reason? The Trade Desk sits in an ideal spot in the industry. Advertising dollars are shifting to digital mediums and while competitors like Meta Platforms and Alphabet operate with limited transparency, The Trade Desk offers more information to its clients, and that is winning over customers. TTD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nTotal worldwide ad spending in 2023 was an estimated $830 billion, which means that The Trade Desk's $9.6 billion in gross ad spending translates to just over 1% of market share. That leaves a tremendous growth runway for this company operating outside the closed ecosystems of big technology companies.\n\nThe Trade Desk's long-term growth opportunities and profitable business model make the stock a no-brainer AI investment you can hold for the long term.\n\nTesla likely has some AI-driven surprises under the hood\n\nWill Healy(Tesla): Investors may tend to look at Tesla as an automaker, but it's actually a diverse business also developing battery technology, solar energy solutions, and AI breakthroughs.\n\nInstead of relying on chip companies like Nvidia for its technology, Tesla has developed its own semiconductor and robotics solutions. Among these are the Dojo chip, designed to power neural networks, and the FSD (full self-driving) chip, which would power fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nCEO Elon Musk wants to launch a robotaxi business based on Tesla technology. With robotaxis, analysts at Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believe Tesla's revenue could reach a minimum of $600 billion by 2027, over seven times the 2023 level of $82 billion.\n\nWood believes that growth would take Tesla's stock price to $2,000 per share, a more than tenfold gain from today's levels.\n\nWhile that may seem outrageous, and Musk has a track record of being overly ambitious in his promises, Wood predicted a split-adjusted price target of $267 per Tesla share in 2018. Within less than three years, Wood's prediction came to pass, so she could be right again.\n\nTesla's stock price has pulled back as Tesla has cut prices on electric vehicles (EVs) to boost sales and stay competitive with emerging rivals. That pessimism has taken its P/E ratio down to 45, a low valuation rarely seen in the stock's history.\n\nAlthough profits are expected to fall 1% this year, analysts predict a 36% increase in 2025. These earnings forecasts give some validation to Wood's thesis. Some of that optimism may be related to the release of the lower-cost, compact Model 2 EV expected for 2025, and investors are also likely to jump in as the company improves its AI and self-driving capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nTrade Desk's estimated fair value is US$79.05 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$83.50 share price, Trade Desk appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 16% lower than Trade Desk's analyst price target of US$94.20\n\nDoes the February share price for The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nIs Trade Desk Fairly Valued?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$702.7m US$815.4m US$1.10b US$1.29b US$1.46b US$1.60b US$1.72b US$1.82b US$1.91b US$1.99b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x5 Analyst x1 Est @ 17.44% Est @ 12.89% Est @ 9.71% Est @ 7.49% Est @ 5.93% Est @ 4.84% Est @ 4.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2%  US$662 US$723 US$919 US$1.0k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$10.0b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$2.0b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.2%\u2013 2.3%) = US$52b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$29b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$39b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$83.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Trade Desk as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.846. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Trade Desk\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nCurrently debt free.\n\nWeakness\n\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Shares were down 8.0% in the fourth quarter, though they still finished the year up 59.1%, after the company guided fourth quarter revenue growth of 18% year-over-year. This was as a result of heightened macro uncertainty impacting advertising budgets early in the fourth quarter particularly in the auto, consumer electronics, and media and entertainment industries, and despite the company noting an improvement in November. While guidance significantly outpaces competitors, suggesting that the Trade Desk is gaining market share, it was below consensus expectations and drove the share price action. We do not view this slowdown as structural and believe the company remains well positioned for 2024 and beyond, with strong tailwinds in CTV as more households continue to cut the cord and as more streaming services adopt and grow their CTV advertising businesses, while a growing proportion of advertisers adopt programmatic advertising. In addition, we believe that the company would benefit from growth in retail media, which enables connecting offline retail sales data with online digital advertising data, the adoption of the company\u2019s new platform, growth in audio, and more.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks I Just Bought More of in February",
        "content": "Despite the market notching new all-time highs, I remain a committed stock buyer. There are multiple companies that are still attractively priced for their growth, and I took advantage of that earlier this month when I purchased shares of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD).\n\nSo why did I purchase shares of these two? Read on to find out.\n\n1. PayPal\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) may be the most misunderstood stock in the market. One of my top reasons to buy it is its criminal undervaluation. PYPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFor a stock to trade this low, it normally isn't growing or caught up in an unsatisfactory trend. However, with PayPal at the forefront of the digital payment trend and revenue increasing at a 9% pace in Q4, it doesn't fit either of these categories.\n\nWith PayPal being undervalued and still growing, it's primed for a strong upside when the market gives it an ounce of respect. But when that will occur is anyone's guess.\n\nMeanwhile, all signs point to significant change going on at PayPal. In January, new CEO Alex Chriss unveiled six innovations to modernize PayPal's ecosystem to attract more customers. These changes should improve the business and give investors more reasons to own the stock.\n\nPayPal's undervaluation and solid business make it a great stock to buy more of now. Still, investors must be patient as the current trend is heavily against the company.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe situation has changed drastically from when I bought The Trade Desk's stock earlier this month. I picked up shares for less than $70, but thanks to a strong Q4 earnings report, the stock trades for around $90. So, would I still buy it now?\n\nThe Trade Desk is a leader in the buy side of ad buying. It equips advertisers with the tools they need to run successful ad campaigns by analyzing viewers' preferences and then increasing or decreasing its bid price to increase conversion rates.\n\nThe company blew away Q4 revenue expectations by growing its revenue by 23% to $606 million -- a $26 million beat. The company's profitability also improved, with earnings per share rising from $0.15 last year to $0.20 this year. Guidance for Q1 was also strong, with revenue expected to increase by 25% to $478 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese fantastic results caused the stock to spike around 20% the following trading day, and the stock now trades for 25 times sales. TTD PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis is far more expensive than the level at which I purchased shares and nearly the same as its revenue growth level. As a result, the stock is a bit too expensive for my taste right now.\n\nI'm content with holding my shares, as The Trade Desk operates as an industry leader in an important segment. Should The Trade Desk's revenue accelerate in Q1 or its price drop, I'd rethink my hold stance. But as of right now, The Trade Desk isn't an attractive buy.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and PayPal made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 20, 2024\n\nKeithen Drury has positions in PayPal and The Trade Desk. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends PayPal and The Trade Desk. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: short March 2024 $67.50 calls on PayPal.

        "content": "In this piece, we will look at the 15 best stocks for long-term growth. If you want to skip our introduction to the current drivers of stock market performance, then check out 5 Best Stocks For Long Term Growth.\n\nThe stock market in 2024 is characterized by a notably optimistic and forward-looking sentiment compared to the beginning of the previous year. Not only did the U.S. economy avoid tipping into recession, but stock markets also maintained their stability, defying expectations of a significant downturn. In fact, February 2024 witnessed the flagship S&P 500 index achieve a historic milestone by crossing the 5,000-point mark for the first time. This feat underscores the resilience and buoyancy of the stock market, highlighting investor confidence in the economic outlook. Additionally, the NASDAQ Composite, which is heavily influenced by the technology sector, approached its all-time high levels during the same period, further accentuating the positive sentiment in the market, albeit experiencing a slight pullback after the breakout.\n\nThe mention of \"AI\" among S&P 500 companies increased to 36% from 31% in the third quarter, with the information technology sector retaining its position as the sector with the most companies discussing AI. However, the energy sector experienced the largest increase in companies discussing this technology, as highlighted by David Kostin and his team of strategists at Goldman Sachs. In addition, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the blockbuster chipmaker prominently associated with AI, has witnessed remarkable growth, with its shares surging nearly 50% in the year, following a more than tripling in value in 2023. This surge has propelled NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, surpassing giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nWhen it comes to stock selection, targeting growth stocks is a common strategy for long-term investors seeking substantial returns. These stocks typically command higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, as they are expected to experience significant growth in the future. One key metric used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares the current share price to the company's earnings per share. A high P/E ratio, especially compared to industry benchmarks, suggests that investors are optimistic about the company's growth potential and are willing to pay a premium for its stock. This optimism is based on the expectation that the company will deliver strong earnings growth in the future, thereby justifying the higher price paid today.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking a long-term perspective on investment opportunities, growth stocks, particularly within the technology sector, showcase promising prospects. Among the noteworthy companies featured in our selection of the best stocks for long-term growth are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), and industry giants like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

        "title": "US$92.00 - That's What Analysts Think The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) Is Worth After These Results",
        "content": "Shareholders will be ecstatic, with their stake up 25% over the past week following The Trade Desk, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TTD) latest annual results. Trade Desk reported US$1.9b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.36 beat expectations, being 2.3% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Trade Desk after the latest results.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing the latest results, Trade Desk's 34 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$2.38b in 2024. This would be a huge 22% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to soar 76% to US$0.64. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$2.32b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.59 in 2024. It looks like there's been a modest increase in sentiment following the latest results, withthe analysts becoming a bit more optimistic in their predictions for both revenues and earnings.\n\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 18% to US$92.00per share. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Trade Desk analyst has a price target of US$110 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$30.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Trade Desk'shistorical trends, as the 22% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 28% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.3% annually. So although Trade Desk is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Trade Desk's earnings potential next year. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

        "content": "Ad-campaign automation specialist The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) sent its share prices soaring on Friday with a fantastic earnings report. The stock jumped as much as 24.2% in the morning before settling down at a still-impressive 19% gain by 12:15 p.m. ET today. The intraday peak reached a fresh two-year high.\n\nThe Trade Desk's quarter, by the numbers\n\nFourth-quarter revenue jumped 23% higher year over year to land at $606 million. Adjusted earnings rose by 9% to $0.41 per diluted share.\n\nYour average Wall Street analyst was looking for earnings near $0.43 per share on top-line sales of roughly $582 million. The Trade Desk fell short of the profit target while exceeding revenue expectations by a similar margin.\n\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, Trade Desk management set its revenue target to \"at least\" $478 million. That would be a 25% annual increase, comfortably ahead of the consensus estimate of an 18% revenue gain.\n\nInvestors were happy to shrug off the bottom-line miss to focus on proven and promised revenue growth instead.\n\nWhat's the secret sauce behind this tasty report?\n\nCEO Jeff Green said in a prepared statement, \"Our results are testament to the growing value that advertisers are placing on the open internet versus the limitations of walled gardens.\" Green also suggested that his company is growing faster than other digital advertising providers, which suggests that the company is stealing market share from its rivals.\n\nThe company generated $63.8 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter -- and then spent a cool $200 million on share buybacks. The Trade Desk's leaders seem convinced that the stock is undervalued, making buybacks a good use of spare cash. It's also a shareholder-friendly strategy, putting cash profits into its owners' wallets.\n\nIf nothing else, The Trade Desk's vibrant report and bullish guidance showed signs of life in the struggling market for online ad sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Why Are The Trade Desk (TTD) Shares Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of advertising software maker The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) jumped 19.9% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided guidance for the next quarter, which blew past analysts' expectations for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA--a key profit measure. Its gross margin also improved during the quarter. Zooming out, the company is growing faster than the digital ad market, telling us that The Trade Desk is taking share. And the company is doing so profitably.\n\nOverall, this was a very impressive quarter that should delight shareholders. Additionally on the capital allocation side, The Trade Desk announced a new share repurchase program that brings the total authorization to $700 million. Repurchases totaled about $650 million in 2023, and this is an overall signal at the strength and dependability of the company's free cash flow.\n\nIs now the time to buy The Trade Desk? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nThe Trade Desk's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for The Trade Desk and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the company dropped 29.1% on the news that the company reported third quarter results and provided revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance below expectations. Management added that \"we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4.\" The markets have been skittish about the macro, and The Trade Desk is a company heavily tied to macro-sensitive advertising, so the weak outlook was a cause for alarm.\n\nOn the other hand, its revenue narrowly topped analysts' expectations during the\u00a0quarter. While it was objectively a mixed quarter for The Trade Desk since results were fine, the guidance was weak, and the market seemed spooked about the future.\n\nThe Trade Desk is up 27.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $89.92 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $91.26 from July 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of The Trade Desk's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,564.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

The Trade Desk, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk, fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO; Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. Copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the investor relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements.\n\nShould any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings.

We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nStory continues\n\nJeffrey Green: Hello, and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, I'm really excited to discuss our strong finish to the year in Q4, reflect on the progress we made in 2023, and explain why I'm so confident about our growth prospects in 2024 and beyond. Total spend on our platform in 2023 was almost $10 billion, a record for us. Revenue in the fourth quarter topped $600 million. The first time we have ever crossed that mark in a single quarter. This record spend helped drive revenue growth of 23% for the year. Once again, significantly outpacing the broader digital advertising market. And of course, we had solid growth in an uncertain market of 2022, when many of our competitors were exiting the year comparatively flat. In fact, in Q4 of 2022, we grew by 24% year-over-year.\n\nSo 23% growth in 2023 on top of very strong growth in 2022 is once again leading the market. We generated adjusted EBITDA of over $770 million in 2023. We also generated $543 million of free cash flow. This relentless focus on profitability and growth allows us to keep investing in innovation, ensuring we are always bringing the best possible value to our clients, whether it's our game-changing Kokai launch or new approaches to identity and authentication for the open internet. While there is much to celebrate about 2023, I'm even more excited about 2024 and beyond. I've never felt more confident heading into a new year. I believe we are uniquely positioned to grow and gain market share, not only in 2024 but well into the future, regardless of some of the pressures that our industry is facing, whether it's cookie deprecation, growing regulatory focus on walled gardens, or the rapidly changing TV landscape.\n\nThese industry shifts represent tremendous growth opportunities for us. Shifts in our nearly $1 trillion global advertising market are not dissimilar from shifts in all large markets, including the equities markets. When macro changes come to the equities markets, caused by economic velocity changes, Fed moves, or governmental changes, these sorts of macro shifts force the smart money to rotate. Or said another way, macro changes almost always force a revaluing of the market. Every investment is scrutinized and adjusted. Similarly, the Internet is being revalued once again. We've seen this many times before. During the pandemic, people streamed more. We got more inventory and the value of choice in CTV helped create better performance, so the value of CTV went up.\n\nThings shifted. We saw it again in 2021 when the Apple made changes to limit relevant advertising in its operating system, which impacted their browser and their mobile environments. We simply adjusted and we bought two segments of the ecosystem with better price discovery and performance, which were still at times inside the Apple ecosystem, but often were not. Often people looking at our massive global industry continually overlook significantly different strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for different types of companies. Some wrongly think only big companies win, and smaller companies like us don't. That paradigm is completely wrong. In general, the current shifts will help companies with authenticated users and traffic, which also sit next to large amount of advertiser demand.\n\nThese macro changes hurt those, especially content owners and publishers who don't have authentication. So this year, CTV and audio have big opportunities ahead, and the rest has pockets of winners and losers. But nearly everyone will be either better off or worse off. And I believe 2024 is a year of volatility for the global advertising market. And for those who are prepared, like The Trade Desk, it is an opportunity to win share. Our platform is set up to make the most of any signal that can help advertisers drive relevance and value. Our platform now sees about 15 million advertising impression opportunities per second. And we effectively stack rank all of those impressions better than anyone else in the world based on probability of performance to any given advertiser without the bias or conflict of interest that plague most walled gardens.\n\nWith UID2, Kokai, and advances in AI in our platform, we now do this more effectively than ever before. And our work in areas such as CTV, retail data, and identity are helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open internet. So, regardless of how the environment evolves around us, we will always be able to help advertisers find the right impressions for them. A great example of this is the work that we're doing with HP. They initially started to think about new approaches to identity because of the imminent cookie deprecation in Chrome. But while the conversation started there, it quickly turned to how new identifiers, such as UID2, could help manage campaigns across all channels, especially channels with high levels of user authentication.\n\nHP started using UID2 for CTV campaigns on Disney and Hulu. Disney being a notable and early adopter of UID2. HP started with their first-party data that consumers had consented to provide after making a purchase. That data was then matched with UID2s on our platform. As a result, HP segmented its audience into specific groups, allowing better targeting and measurement of specific product campaigns with more accuracy. HP was then able to link ad exposure data from UID2 identifiers with the device registration data in its CDP to connect consumers with actual online conversions and sales. That measurement proved to be more effective than the multi-touch attribution model that HP had been using, according to Caitlin Nardi, their head of programmatic for North America.\n\nThis is a great example of how we're improving advertising outcomes for a major global brand by integrating new approaches to identity, authenticated audiences in high growth channels such as CTV and retail sales conversion data. It all started with a conversation about cookie deprecation, but the answer was something much more advanced, which speaks to the way that most major advertisers are innovating with us. And it's why we're embedding these innovations into Kokai. As I've said before, walled gardens are not an optimal competitive environment for the open internet. And the open internet will continue to challenge the walled gardens as the place where the very first advertising dollar is spent. Because for the most part, premium content is outside of the walled gardens, and all the questionable user-generated content is inside of the walled gardens, from cat videos to political rants to hate speech to cyber bullying.\n\nWalled gardens simply use self-reported numbers in an increasingly opaque black box. Meanwhile, retail data and premium content are making the open internet more compelling than ever. I predict this trend will accelerate during this year, which, of course, is an election year. I think it's worth spending a bulk of my time unpacking the transitions we are seeing in the industry, as it will highlight why we continue to outperform and why I'm so confident about our growth potential moving forward. To do that, I'd like to cover three main areas. First, how advertising channels such as CTV, retail media, and even digital audio are helping replumb the internet from an advertising perspective. Second, what the future of relevance in advertising looks like as the identity landscape evolves.\n\nAnd third, why Kokai helps us advance our growth opportunity in the context of all of this. In order to understand some of the more interesting drivers of our business, I think it's important to note the macro environment we're dealing with. For nearly all of 2023, there was uncertainty, particularly around economic growth rates and recessionary fears. In that environment, CMOs become much more reliant on their CFOs, and CFOs needed to make sure that every dollar spent was in service of growth. Which means CMOs had to focus more than ever on where they could achieve efficacy and deliver strong and provable return on ad spent. That pressure came at the same time that many CTV content owners around the world were seeing how much more valuable ad viewing subscriptions were to them than the higher priced ad free subscribers.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that our growth in 2023 was driven by ongoing strength in CTV and continued leadership through strong and expanding partnerships in retail and retail media. In each of these markets, advertisers can really put data to work and drive precision because they have a greater sense of confidence and who they are actually reaching. In CTV and other emerging channels such as digital audio, there's a logged in authenticated user base. In retail media, our platform works with actual authenticated sales data. CTV continues to be the fastest growing channel at scale for The Trade Desk. There's a ton of speculation right now about the future of the TV industry, but every major TV trend is good for us. Linear is shrinking and users are streaming instead.\n\nWe have built our business around streaming premium content. Subscriptions are moving to ad-funded models and both consumers and content owners want that. As the industry oscillates back and forth from fragmentation to consolidation in all scenarios, we're partnering to provide demand from the biggest advertisers in the world. But one thing is clear through all of this, ad-supported streaming is going to be an essential strategy for any successful TV provider moving forward. Nearly every major streamer has stated that they make more money from their ad-supported tiers than from their subscription only and was reported pretty extensively in recent weeks with the price of subscription models continuing to rise, consumer fatigue is settling in.\n\nThere's only so much disposable entertainment money to go around. According to the Wall Street Journal, 25% of US streaming subscribers have canceled at least three subscriptions over the last two years, up from 15% for their prior two-year period. In fact, by hiking the cost of the no ad subscription services, streamers are pushing viewers to the cheaper ad-supported options, because they are more lucrative. There is only one way for the CTV ecosystem to mature. Content owners in CTV and audio get good at presenting three clear choices to consumers. Pay for access to content by seeing a few relevant ads or pay more money to avoid them or some kind of hybrid of those two. Consumers will have choice and CTV and audio will find their coveted incremental users.\n\nSome want to pay with time and some want to pay with money. There's enough pressure to fund the CTV content machines that all of them have to get focused on a light ad load with high CPMs to create the best experiences for their users. While there is more than enough pressure on TV content owners to expand relevant ad programs, there is probably even more pressure on big players of audio. 2024 will be a big year for audio, depending on the strategic choices that those players make. Just like CTV, digital audio benefits from a highly authenticated, logged in audience. Also like CTV, digital audio listeners are highly leaned in. Advertisers have a captive audience that are engaged with quality, professional content. Whether it's a podcast or your favorite music, engagement is high.\n\nAnd we're spending more and more time with audio streaming leaders in part because I believe they are in the very early innings of seeing the value of data driven advertising and about to set out on the journey that CTV companies began years ago. Another area of strong growth for us in the fourth quarter was retail media. Again, a major reason for this is that advertisers got to work with their first party data. In this case, real world sales data. In the fourth quarter, we saw major new shopper marketing budgets shift to The Trade Desk as more advertisers started to move from a non-decision insertion order strategy, which has long been typical in the retail space, to one that's highly decision and leveraging retail media. A great example of an advertiser leaning into retail media is Samsung in Canada.\n\nA large percentage of Samsung's device and appliance sales take place through carriers and retailers. In order to understand how advertising is influencing consumer purchases in those channels, they needed a way to unlock their first-party data and combine it with retail data. Working with their agency, Starcom, we helped Samsung develop what they call the Samsung sales measurement tool on our platform. When buyers make a purchase, they are prompted to open an account with Samsung and opt in to marketing engagement. With the right permissions, Samsung can then look back through their marketing activations across masses of consumers and start to attribute campaign activities to different stages of the purchase funnel. This helps Samsung be much more precise with their campaign activities looking forward.\n\nWorking with us, they can attribute the effectiveness of marketing directly on sales 19 times more effectively than they were previously. I spend time on these growth drivers not only to give you a sense of why I'm so confident in our prospects this year, but also to underscore how major advertisers are thinking about identity and authentication. Which brings me to my second point or second topic, the evolving world of identity. I don't think it's an understatement to say that there's considerable thrash in the industry driven by Google's recent decision to accelerate the deprecation of third party cookies. It had previously been scheduled to begin deprecation at the end of March of this year, but moved up to the beginning of the year in January.\n\nI just want to be clear on one point. For all of the industry debate that's been caused by these changes, The Trade Desk stands to benefit. As I said a few minutes ago, we see approximately 15 million ad impression opportunities every second on our platform. And the vast majority of the ad impressions that we value don't have anything to do with third party cookies. When you consider the fastest growing channels of digital advertising, such as CTV or digital audio, they've never relied on cookies. Retail data doesn't rely on cookies. What our clients care about is being able to reach their audiences with precision and relevance. And we help them do that using whatever signal is available to us. And increasingly, as I've just discussed, the post-cookie world is one that will combine authentication, new approaches to identity, first-party data activation, and advanced AI-driven relevance tools, all to create a new identity fabric for the internet that is so much more effective than cookies ever were. A large array of computer screens and tech equipment representing the technology company's self-service cloud-based platform.\n\nThe internet is being replunged and our product offerings create the best outcome for all of the open internet. The offerings of the walled gardens often are good for them than no one else. Let's also remember that we've seen this movie before. Today, cookies have already been deprecated for around a third of all display impressions. Browsers such as Firefox and Safari made the transition several years ago. Neither of those shifts meaningfully affected our business. In fact, quite the opposite. We continue to innovate a full range of ways for our clients to understand the relevance value of every advertising impression and price them accordingly. In fact, the value we add to advertisers and agencies has gone up with all these changes. Those shifts make it important to consider buying different impressions.\n\nAnd so we do. We're constantly objectively helping buyers to know where to find value and performance. As the relative value of ad shifts to somewhere else, we shift too. One example of this is the work we're doing with Unilever in Thailand. They were looking to raise awareness for their new detergent product, as well as test new identifiers that could advance addressability in a post-cookie environment. Using their own first-party data as a seed, they leveraged UID2 to target relevant audiences and measured against Unilever's traditional audience targeting methods. The results showed a marked improvement over these traditional methods, which include cookies across key areas of measurement such as click-through rate, brand awareness, and cost per completed view.\n\nInterestingly, this work relied on UID2s created from encrypted phone numbers, which is a big part of the identity fabric in Asia. This UID2 work with Unilever is now expanding into additional markets in Southeast Asia. I know you're going to ask me specifically about Privacy Sandbox, because nearly everyone else does, so I'll touch on it here. I've written fairly extensively on it on our news platform, The Current, so you can see my thoughts there in more detail. But the [Cliffs Notes] (ph) version is that I believe Google has missed an opportunity to build something better. Increased complexity with decreased functionality is hardly a compelling offering. To publishers, they are effectively saying, do more work and make less money. I believe Privacy Sandbox is an incredibly complex product, understood fully by very few people, which will likely degrade the Chrome user experience for publishers and brands, but especially for users.\n\nUsers personalization will break more often. Users will begin to be required to log in seemingly everywhere. Browser-based publishers, including mobile, will likely have to do what so many e-commerce sites already do. Ask for an email address when you arrive. The consumers will get a weaker experience for a while, and publishers will make less money until they change. However, this has less impact on advertisers, especially those with quality first-party data, and it is more likely to help The Trade Desk than it is to hurt us. For many reasons, we will be better off, but a few of those to include. First, we're on the buy side. We also represent the majority of Fortune 500 brands. We also invested in UID2 many years ago. We invested in AI many years ago.\n\nAnd our business is increasingly built around CTV audio and environments that are almost always authenticated. Fewer cookies doesn't really matter a ton for us. It doesn't stop our work because we've been busy with other open internet pioneers building something much better. Where there is real risk is on the publisher side of the ad ecosystem, especially browser-based publishers. Others have reported that declines in publisher CPMs in Chrome, where cookies have been deprecated, are around 30%. That's potentially devastating for publishers, of course. Not so much for advertisers who continue to have millions of choices a second on where to spend their ad dollars. But this threat to publishers comes as there are daily reports of journalism outlets laying off major swaths of their newsrooms amid a really tight business climate.\n\nWhile there may be many reasons for the struggles that journalism outlets are having, one of the dirty secrets of the industry is that, authentication rates there are surprisingly low. That means that they don't have any sense of who is visiting their destinations, and they've been reliant on cookies until now to create relevance for advertisers. Without either cookies or publisher authentication, advertisers won't value those ad impressions nearly as much. This is a wake-up call for publishers. And the math is obvious. $1 CPM turns into $0.70 with cookie deprecation. We're often seeing $1 CPM turn into a $1.30 when UID2 is layered on it. So when publishers get to consider the contrast of $1.30 versus $0.70, the math is more obvious than ever.\n\nIn some cases, they only recently started looking at the math when the dollar suddenly turned into $0.70. So 2024 has started off as a year of action for our industry. On the positive side, we're seeing more publishers lean in to single sign-on authentication tools that they control. For example, we've seen a major uptick in publishers deploying Openpath. These include Snopes, OK Magazine, Radar Online, and many others. We expect many more to deploy this in the months ahead. Openpath lets publishers authenticate their regular visitors so they can help advertisers score the relevance of their ad impression. All of this taken together brings me to my third point, our new Kokai platform. Much of what I've been talking about today is embedded into Kokai.\n\nIn particular, Kokai represents a completely new way to understand and score the relevance of every ad impression across all channels. It allows advertisers to use an audience first approach to their campaigns, targeting their audiences wherever they are on the open internet. Our AI optimizations, which are now distributed across the platform, help optimize every element of the ad purchase process. Kokai is now live and similar to Nxtwave and Solomar, it will scale over the next year. It's our largest platform overhaul in our company's history and I could not be more proud of the incredible work of our product and engineering teams. In Q4, me and our product team personally visited four continents and met with hundreds of clients in each location.\n\nEurope, North America, with large showings in New York City and Chicago, as well as in Asia and Australia. After spending half a day in each location with almost a thousand clients in total, almost every single one of our clients believe that Kokai is a major upgrade to our platform and to the ecosystem. We have never launched a product with this much change and we've never launched a product with this much confidence that what we have represents a major advance in advertiser performance and that it is going to be enthusiastically adopted. So let me wrap up. I've covered a lot of ground, but there's a lot going on in our industry. And I thought it was important to reiterate why I feel so confident about our position and our prospects. In closing, I'd like to just summarize a few key points.\n\nFirst, agencies and brands are becoming more deliberate with their campaign budgets. They are shifting ad dollars to where they can be more data driven and precise in everything they do. And this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace. Exiting last year, over a third of our business fell under a JVP. Second, we are reinforcing our position as the ad tech AI leader. We've been embedding AI into our platform since 2016. So it's nothing new to us. But now it's being distributed across our platform so our clients can make even better choices among the 15 million ad impression opportunities the second. And understand which of those ads are most relevant to their audience segments at any given time. Third, connected TV continues to be the fastest growing channel of our business at scale and the key driver of overall omnichannel growth.\n\nAnd it's not just here in the US. We're seeing strong CTV growth across EMEA and Asia as more CTV inventory comes online. CTV companies are driving a ton of innovation in our industry, particularly around identity. And it's no coincidence that they have been among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of UID2. Fourth, retail media has become one of the fastest growing areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail partnerships and retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers think about connecting advertising to actual consumer actions. And more and more of the world's leading retailers are now active on our platform. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the US over the last few years in CTV and in retail media but also in our overall go-to-market strategy.\n\nOur business outside the US grew at a much faster pace than here in the US last year. We believe we are in a position to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth, we've seen a rapid uptick in adoption of UID2 and EUID as a new identity currency for the open Internet from advertisers, publishers, and everyone who serves them. But perhaps even more encouraging, we're seeing significant performance improvements for advertisers who are using UID2 and this is accelerating adoption. Seventh, of course, 2024 stands to be a major year for political spending here in the United States. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. This year, we expect to gain more share in this segment, and we believe that political spend will increase as the year progresses.\n\nThe Trade Desk is very well positioned as the advertising industry evolves. We built our business model on the belief that objectivity and aligning our interests with buyers would matter more and more over time. Objectivity matters more now than it ever has before. And that trend will continue as walled gardens continue to grow their conflict of interest faster than ever. We are executing well. We are poised for growth. 2023 was an excellent year. We expect 2024 to be even stronger. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Laura to discuss our financials.\n\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff. Before I go through the details of the quarter, I want to build on Jeff's sentiments regarding the strides we've made in 2023 and emphasize the consistency in our strong execution. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, The Trade Desk delivered revenue growth over 20% every quarter, against what many would say were a challenging two years for the digital advertising industry. Whether it's our work in areas such as CTV, retail data, our platform upgrading Kokai, AI advances in our platform, or helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open internet, The Trade Desk remains resilient and we continue to execute efficiently. Now onto our results. We ended the year with a strong Q4 and our teams have carried the momentum into the start of the year.\n\nQ4 revenue was $606 million, a 23% increase year-over-year. Excluding political election spend, which was a mid-single digit percent of revenue in Q4 2022. Revenue grew 27% year-over-year. I am particularly proud of the $284 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 47%, which helped drive full year adjusted EBITDA margin to about 40% and full year free cash flow of over $540 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2023 were another example of our ability to grow our top line and gain share while simultaneously investing in our business and platform to support future growth. For 2023 we ended the year with $9.6 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.9 billion in revenue, representing 23% revenue growth.\n\nAs expected, our take rate in 2023 once again remained within a very consistent historical range. We continue to execute on the model set out at the company's inception of keeping take rate consistent while substantially increasing the value that our platform provides. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry. As we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continue to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, with particularly strong growth internationally.\n\nWe saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and more advertisers continue to utilize retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results from increased utilization of first party data. As the enhancements we've made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of spend and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter.\n\nIt's worth noting, international growth again outpaced North America for the fourth quarter in a row. As I mentioned, CTV across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $340 million, up 29% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology development, as we positioned the organization for long term growth. Income tax expense was $63 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $207 million, or $0.41 per fully diluted share.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $91 million and free cash flow was 64 million in Q4. DSOs exiting Q4 were 101 days, down three days from a year ago. DPOs were 83 days, also down three days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.4 billion in cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, we repurchased $220 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program during Q4. As you have seen during our press release, today we announced new authorization under our share repurchase program of up to $700 million, which includes $53 million remaining in the existing authorization. Given the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the consistent cash flow generation of our business model, we plan to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares and offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances.\n\nNow turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. We estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $478 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $130 million in Q1. In terms of our operating plan, we plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount efficiently. Similar to 2023, we expect to grow headcount at a rate slower than revenue growth. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to wait investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement.\n\nIn closing, I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023 and our setup in 2024. We are executing to capture growth within key secular drivers like CTV and shopper marketing. We're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPass. Our international business is poised to continue helping drive our growth. We continue to gain share within the political vertical heading into the US presidential election cycle. We're adding more value for our customers with our biggest product release ever with Kokai and we continue to innovate our platform. We enter 2024 in a strong position to grow and gain more share. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks.\n\nAnd with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nSee also 15 Top Performing European Stocks So Far in 2024 and 20 Cities With The Highest Cost of Living in the US.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\n\nChris Toth\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. Copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. \r\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. \r\nShould any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. \r\nIn addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\n\nStory continues\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nHello, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, I'm really excited to discuss our strong finish to the year and Q4, reflect on the progress we made in 2023 and explain why I'm so confident about our growth prospects in 2024 and beyond. \r\nTotal spend on our platform in 2023 was up -- almost $10 billion, a record for us. Revenue in the fourth quarter topped $600 million, the first time we have ever crossed that mark in a single quarter. This record spend helped drive revenue growth of 23% for the year, once again significantly outpacing the broader digital advertising market. And of course, we had solid growth in an uncertain market of 2022 when many of our competitors were exiting the year comparatively flat. In fact, in Q4 of 2022, we grew by 24% year-over-year, so 23% growth in 2023 on top of very strong growth in 2022 is once again, leading the market. \r\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA of over $770 million in 2023. We also generated $543 million of free cash flow. This relentless focus on profitability and growth allows us to keep investing in innovation, ensuring we are always bringing the best possible value to our clients, whether it's our game-changing Kokai launch or new approaches to identity and authentication for the open Internet. \r\nWhile there is much to celebrate about 2023, I'm even more excited about 2024 and beyond, I've never felt more confident heading into a new year. I believe we are uniquely positioned to grow and gain market share not only in 2024 but well into the future. Regardless of some of the pressures that our industry is facing, whether it's cookie deprecation, growing regulatory focus on walled gardens, or the rapidly changing TV landscape. These industry shifts represent tremendous growth opportunities for us. \r\nShifts in our nearly $1 trillion global advertising market are not dissimilar from shifts in all large markets, including the equities markets. When macro changes come to the equities markets caused by economic velocity changes, Fed moves or governmental changes, these sorts of macro shifts force the smart money to rotate. Or said another way, macro changes almost always force a revaluing of the market. Every investment is scrutinized and adjusted. Similarly, the Internet is being revalued once again. \r\nWe've seen this many times before. During the pandemic, people streamed more. We got more inventory and the value of choice in CTV helped to create better performance so the value of CTV went up. Things shifted. We saw it again in 2021 when Apple made changes to limit relevant advertising in its operating system, which impacted their browser and their mobile environments. We simply adjusted and we bought 2 segments of the ecosystem with better price discovery and performance, which were still at times inside the Apple ecosystem but often were not. \r\nOften, people looking at our massive global industry continually overlook significantly different strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for different types of companies. Some wrongly think only big companies win and smaller companies like us don't. That paradigm is completely wrong. \r\nIn general, the current shifts will help companies with authenticated users and traffic, which also sit next to large amount of advertiser demand. These macro changes hurt those, especially content owners and publishers who don't have authentication. So this year, CTV and audio have big opportunities ahead, and the rest has pockets of winners and losers but nearly everyone will be either better off or worse off. And I believe 2024 is a year of volatility for the global advertising market. \r\nAnd for those who are prepared, like The Trade Desk, it is an opportunity to win share. Our platform is set up to make the most of any signal that can help advertisers drive relevance and value. Our platform now sees about 15 million advertising impression opportunities per second. And we effectively stack rank all of those impressions better than anyone else in the world based on probability of performance to any given advertiser, without the bias or conflict of interest that plagued most walled gardens. \r\nWith UID2, Kokai and advances in AI in our platform, we now do this more effectively than ever before. And our work in areas such as CTV, retail data and identity are helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open Internet. \r\nSo regardless of how the environment evolves around us, we will always be able to help advertisers find the right impressions for them. A great example of this is the work that we're doing with HP. They initially started to think about new approaches to identity because of the imminent cookie deprecation in Chrome. But while the conversation started there, it quickly turned to how new identifiers such as UID2 could help manage campaigns across all channels, especially channels with high levels of user authentication. HP started using UID2 for CTV campaigns on Disney and Hulu, Disney being a notable and early adopter of UID2. HP started with their first-party data that consumers had consented to provide after making a purchase. \r\nThat data was then matched with UID2s on our platform. As a result, HP segmented its audience into specific groups, allowing better targeting and measurement of specific product campaigns with more accuracy. HP was then able to link ad exposure data from UID2 identifiers with the device registration data in its CDP to connect consumers with actual online conversions and sales. That measurement proved to be more effective than the multi-touch attribution model that HP had been using according to Caitlin Nardi, their head of programmatic for North America. \r\nThis is a great example of how we're improving advertising outcomes for a major global brand by integrating new approaches to identity, authenticated audiences in high-growth channels such as CTV and retail sales conversion data. \r\nIt all started with a conversation about cookie deprecation, but the answer was something much more advanced, which speaks to the way that most major advertisers are innovating with us. And it's why we're embedding these innovations into Kokai. As I've said before, walled gardens are not an optimal competitive environment for the open Internet, and the open Internet will continue to challenge the walled gardens as the place where the very first advertising dollar is spent. \r\nBecause for the most part, premium content is outside of the walled gardens and all the questionable user-generated content is inside of the walled gardens, from cat videos to political rants to hate speech to cyberbullying, walled gardens simply use self-reported numbers in an increasingly opaque black box. Meanwhile, retail data and premium content are making the open Internet more compelling than ever. I predict this trend will accelerate during this year, which of course, is an election year. \r\nI think it's worth spending the bulk of my time unpacking the transitions we are seeing in the industry as it will highlight why we continue to outperform and why I'm so confident about our growth potential moving forward. To do that, I'd like to cover 3 main areas: first, how advertising channels such as CTV, retail media and even digital audio are helping replumb the Internet from an advertising perspective; second, what the future of relevance in advertising looks like as the identity landscape evolves; and third, why Kokai helps us advance our growth opportunity in the context of all of this. \r\nIn order to understand some of the more interesting drivers of our business, I think it's important to note the macro environment we're dealing with. For nearly all of 2023, there was uncertainty, particularly around economic growth rates and recessionary fears. In that environment, CMOs become much more reliant on their CFOs, and CFOs needed to make sure that every dollar spent was in service of growth, which means CMOs had to focus more than ever on where they could achieve efficacy and deliver strong and provable return on ad spend. \r\nThat pressure came in at the same time that many CTV content owners around the world were seeing how much more valuable ad viewing subscriptions were to them than the higher-priced ad-free subscribers. It is not a coincidence that our growth in 2023 was driven by ongoing strength in CTV and continued leadership through strong and expanding partnerships in retail and retail media. In each of these markets, advertisers can really put data to work and drive precision because they have a greater sense of confidence in who they are actually reaching. \r\nIn CTV and other emerging channels such as digital audio, there's a logged-in authenticated user base. In retail media, our platform works with actual authenticated sales data. CTV continues to be the fastest-growing channel at scale for The Trade Desk. There's a ton of speculation right now about the future of the TV industry, but every major TV trend is good for us. Linear is shrinking and users are streaming instead. We have built our business around streaming premium content. Subscriptions are moving to ad-funded models, and both consumers and content owners want that. \r\nAs the industry oscillates back and forth from fragmentation to consolidation, in all scenarios, we are partnering to provide demand from the biggest advertisers in the world. But 1 thing is clear through all of this, ad-supported streaming is going to be an essential strategy for any successful TV provider moving forward. \r\nNearly every major streamer has stated that they make more money from their ad-supported tiers than from their subscription-only and was reported pretty extensively in recent weeks With the price of subscription models continuing to rise, consumer fatigue is settling in. There's only so much disposable entertainment money to go around. According to The Wall Street Journal, 25% of U.S. streaming subscribers have canceled at least 3 subscriptions over the last 2 years, up from 15% for the prior 2-year period. \r\nIn fact, by hiking the cost of the no-ad subscription services, streamers are pushing viewers to the cheaper ad-supported options because they are more lucrative. There's only 1 way for the CTV ecosystem to mature. Content owners in CTV and audio get good at presenting 3 clear choices to consumers: pay for access to content by seeing a few relevant ads; or pay more money to avoid them; or some kind of hybrid of those 2. Consumers will have choice and CTV and audio will find their coveted incremental users. Some want to pay with time and some want to pay with money. There is enough pressure to fund the CTV content machines that all of them have to get focused on a light ad load with high CPMs to create the best experiences for their users. \r\nWhile there is more than enough pressure on TV content owners to expand relevant ad programs, there is probably even more pressure on big players of audio. 2024 will be a big year for audio, depending on the strategic choices that those players make. Just like CTV, digital audio benefits from a highly authenticated logged-in audience. Also like CTV, digital audio listeners are highly leaned in. Advertisers have a captive audience that are engaged with quality professional content. Whether it's a podcast or your favorite music, engagement is high. And we're spending more and more time with audio streaming leaders in part because I believe they are in the very early innings of seeing the value of data-driven advertising and about to set out on the journey that CTV companies began years ago. \r\nAnother area of strong growth for us in the fourth quarter was retail media. Again, a major reason for this is that advertisers got to work with their first-party data, in this case, real-world sales data. In the fourth quarter, we saw a major new shopper marketing budget shift to The Trade Desk as more advertisers started to move from a non-decisioned insertion order strategy, which has long been typical in the retail space to one that's highly decisioned and leveraging retail media. \r\nA great example of an advertiser leaning into retail media is Samsung in Canada. A large percentage of Samsung's device and appliance sales take place through carriers and retailers. In order to understand how advertising is influencing consumer purchases in those channels, they needed a way to unlock their first-party data and combine it with retail data. Working with their agency, Starcom, we helped Samsung develop what they call the Samsung sales measurement tool on our platform. \r\nWhen buyers make a purchase, they are prompted to open an account with Samsung and opt-in to marketing and engagement. With the right permission, Samsung can then look back through their marketing activations across masses of consumers and start to attribute campaign activities to different stages of the purchase funnel. \r\nThis helped Samsung be much more precise with their campaign activities looking forward. Working with us, they can attribute the effectiveness of marketing directly on sales 19x more effectively than they were previously. \r\nI spend time on these growth drivers not only to give you a sense of why I'm so confident in our prospects this year, but also to underscore how major advertisers are thinking about identity and authentication, which brings me to my second point or second topic, the evolving world of identity. \r\nI don't think it's an understatement to say that there's considerable thrash in the industry, driven by Google's recent decision to accelerate the deprecation of third-party cookies. It had previously been scheduled to begin deprecation at the end of March of this year but moved up to the beginning of the year in January. \r\nI just want to be clear on 1 point, for all of the industry debate that's been caused by these changes, The Trade Desk stands to benefit. As I said a few minutes ago, we see approximately 15 million ad impression opportunities every second on our platform. And the vast majority of the ad impressions that we value don't have anything to do with third-party cookies. \r\nWhen you consider the fastest-growing channels of digital advertising, such as CTV or digital audio, they've never relied on cookies. Retail data doesn't rely on cookies. What our clients care about is being able to reach their audiences with precision and relevance, and we help them do that using whatever signal is available to us. \r\nAnd increasingly, as I just discussed, the post-cookie world is one that will combine authentication, new approaches to identity, first-party data activation and advanced AI-driven relevance tools, all to create a new identity fabric for the Internet that is so much more effective than cookies ever were. \r\nThe Internet is being replumbed and our product offerings create the best outcome for all of the open Internet. The offerings of the walled gardens often are good for them and no one else. Let's also remember that we've seen this movie before. Today, cookies have already been deprecated for around 1/3 of all display impressions. Browsers such as Firefox and Safari made the transition several years ago. Neither of those shifts meaningfully affected our business. In fact, quite the opposite. We continue to innovate a full range of ways for our clients to understand the relevance value of every advertising impression and price them accordingly. \r\nIn fact, the value we add to advertisers and agencies has gone up with all these changes. Those shifts make it important to consider buying different impressions, and so we do. We're constantly objectively helping buyers to know where to find value and performance. As the relative value of ad shifts to somewhere else, we shift too. \r\nOne example of this is the work we're doing with Unilever in Thailand. They were looking to raise awareness for their new detergent product, as well as test new identifiers that could advance addressability in a post-cookie environment. Using their own first-party data as a seed, they leveraged UID2 to target relevant audiences and measured against Unilever's traditional audience targeting methods. \r\nThe results showed a marked improvement over these traditional methods, which include cookies across key areas of measurements such as click-through rate, brand awareness and cost per completed view. Interestingly, this work relied on UID2s created from encrypted phone numbers, which is a big part of the identity fabric in Asia. This UID2 work with Unilever is now expanding into additional markets in Southeast Asia. \r\nI know you're going to ask me specifically about Privacy Sandbox because nearly everyone else does, so I'll touch on it here. I've written fairly extensively on it on our news platform, The Current, so you can see my thoughts there in more detail. But the Cliffs Notes version is that I believe Google has missed an opportunity to build something better. Increased complexity with decreased functionality is hardly a compelling offering. To publishers, they are effectively saying, do more work and make less money. I believe Privacy Sandbox is an incredibly complex product, understood fully by very few people, which will likely degrade the Chrome user experience for publishers and brands but especially for users. \r\nUsers personalization will break more often. Users will begin to be required to log in seemingly everywhere. Browser-based publishers, including mobile, will likely have to do what so many e-commerce sites already do, ask for an e-mail address when you arrive. The consumers will get a weaker experience for a while and publishers will make less money until they change. \r\nHowever, this has less impact on advertisers, especially those with quality first-party data, and it is more likely to help The Trade Desk than it is to hurt us. For many reasons, we will be better off, but a few of those to include: first, we're on the buy side. We also represent the majority of Fortune 500 brands. We also invested in UID2 many years ago. We invested in AI many years ago. And our business is increasingly built around CTV, audio and environments that are almost always authenticated. \r\nFewer cookies doesn't really matter a ton for us. It doesn't stop our work because we've been busy with other open Internet pioneers building something much better. Where there is real risk is on the publisher's side of the ad ecosystem, especially browser-based publishers. \r\nOthers have reported that declines in publisher CPMs in Chrome where cookies have been deprecated are around 30%. That's potentially devastating for publishers, of course. Not so much for advertisers who continue to have millions of choices a second on where to spend their ad dollars. But this threat to publishers comes as there are daily reports of journalism outlets laying off major swaths of their newsrooms amid a really tight business climate. \r\nWhile there may be many reasons for the struggles that journalism outlets are having, one of the dirty secrets of the industry is that authentication rates there are surprisingly low. That means that they don't have any sense of who is visiting their destinations, and they've been reliant on cookies until now to create relevance for advertisers. Without either cookies or publisher authentication, advertisers won't value those ad impressions nearly as much. This is a wake-up call for publishers. \r\nAnd the math is obvious. $1 CPM turns into $0.70 with cookie deprecation. We are often seeing $1 CPM turn into $1.30 when UID2 is layered on it. So when publishers get to consider the contrast of $1.30 versus $0.70, the math is more obvious than ever. In some cases, they only recently started looking at the math when the dollar suddenly turned into $0.70. So 2024 has started off as a year of action for our industry. \r\nOn the positive side, we're seeing more publishers lean into single sign-on authentication tools that they control. For example, we've seen a major uptick in publishers deploying OpenPath. These include Snopes, OK! Magazine, Radar Online and many others. We expect many more to deploy this in the months ahead. \r\nOpenPath lets publishers authenticate their regular visitors so they can help advertisers score the relevance of their ad impressions. All of this taken together brings me to my third point, our new Kokai platform. Much of what I've been talking about today is embedded into Kokai. In particular, Kokai represents a completely new way to understand and score the relevance of every ad impression across all channels. It allows advertisers to use an audience-first approach to their campaigns, targeting their audiences wherever they are on the open Internet. Our AI optimizations, which are now distributed across the platform, help optimize every element of the ad purchase process. \r\nKokai is now live, and similar to Next Wave and Solimar, it will scale over the next year. It's our largest platform overhaul in our company's history, and I could not be more proud of the incredible work of our product and engineering teams. \r\nIn Q4, me and our product team personally visited 4 continents and met with hundreds of clients in each location, Europe, North America with large showings in New York City and Chicago as well as in Asia and Australia. After spending half a day in each location with almost 1,000 clients in total, almost every single one of our clients believe that Kokai is a major upgrade to our platform and to the ecosystem. We have never launched a product with this much change, and we've never launched a product with this much confidence that what we have represents a major advance in advertiser performance and that it is going to be enthusiastically adopted. \r\nSo let me wrap up. I've covered a lot of ground but there's a lot going on in our industry. And I thought it was important to reiterate why I feel so confident about our position and our prospects. \r\nIn closing, I'd like to just summarize a few key points. First, agencies and brands are becoming more deliberate with their campaign budgets. They are shifting ad dollars to where they can be more data-driven and precise in everything they do. And this is driving them to find JVPs with us at a record pace. Exiting last year, over 1/3 of our business fell under a JVP. \r\nSecond, we are reinforcing our position as the adtech AI leader. We've been embedding AI into our platform since 2016, so it's nothing new to us. But now it's being distributed across our platform so our clients can make even better choices among the 15 million ad impression opportunities a second and understand which of those ads are most relevant to their audience segments at any given time.\r\nThird, connected TV continues to be the fastest-growing channel of our business at scale and the key driver of overall omnichannel growth. And it's not just here in the U.S. We're seeing strong CTV growth across EMEA and Asia as more CTV inventory comes online. CTV companies are driving a ton of innovation in our industry, particularly around identity. And it's no coincidence that they have been among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of UID2. \r\nFourth, retail media has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail partnerships in retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers think about connecting advertising to actual consumer actions. And more and more of the world's leading retailers are now active on our platform. \r\nFifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the U.S. over the last few years in CTV and in retail media but also in our overall go-to-market strategy. Our business outside the U.S. grew at a much faster pace than here in the U.S. last year. We believe we are in a position to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. \r\nSixth, we've seen a rapid uptick in adoption of UID2 and EUID as a new identity currency for the open Internet from advertisers, publishers and everyone who serves them. \r\nBut perhaps even more encouraging, we're seeing significant performance improvements for advertisers who are using UID2, and this is accelerating adoption. \r\nSeventh, of course, 2024 stands to be a major year for political spending here in the United States. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. This year, we expect to gain more share in this segment, and we believe that political spend will increase as the year progresses. \r\nThe Trade Desk is very well positioned as the advertising industry evolves. We've built our business model on the belief that objectivity and aligning our interest with buyers would matter more and more over time. Objectivity matters more now than it ever has before, and that trend will continue as walled gardens continue to grow their conflict of interest faster than ever. We are executing well, we are poised for growth. 2023 was an excellent year. We expect 2024 to be even stronger. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Laura to discuss our financials.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nThank you, Jeff. Before I go through the details of the quarter, I want to build on Jeff's sentiments regarding the strides we've made in 2023 and emphasize the consistency in our strong execution. \r\nOver the course of 2022 and 2023, The Trade Desk delivered revenue growth over 20% every quarter against what many would say were a challenging 2 years for the digital advertising industry. Whether it's our work in areas such as CTV, retail data or platform upgrade in Kokai, AI advances in our platform or helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open Internet, The Trade Desk remains resilient and we continue to execute efficiently. \r\nNow on to our results. We ended the year with a strong Q4 and our teams have carried the momentum into the start of the year. Q4 revenue was $606 million, a 23% increase year-over-year. Excluding political election spend, which was a mid-single-digit percent of revenue in Q4 2022, revenue grew 27% year-over-year. \r\nI am particularly proud of the $284 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 47%, which helped drive full year adjusted EBITDA margin to about 40% and full year free cash flow of over $540 million. \r\nOur results in both Q4 and for the full year 2023 were another example of our ability to grow our top line and gain share while simultaneously investing in our business and platform to support future growth. \r\nFor 2023, we ended the year with $9.6 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.9 billion in revenue, representing 23% revenue growth. As expected, our take rate in 2023 once again remained within a very consistent historical reach. We continue to execute on the model set out at the company's inception of keeping take rate consistent while substantially increasing the value that our platform provides. \r\nWe remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a totable addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. \r\nThe shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continue to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world with particularly strong growth internationally. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and more advertisers continue to utilize retail data in their campaigns. \r\nAnd we continue to see positive results from increased utilization of first-party data as the enhancements we've made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. \r\nGeographically, North America represented about 88% of spend and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter. It's worth noting international growth again outpaced North America for the fourth quarter in a row. As I mentioned, CTV across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. \r\nTurning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $340 million, up 29% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development as we position the organization for long-term growth. \r\nIncome tax expense was $63 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. \r\nAdjusted net income for the quarter was $207 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $91 million and free cash flow was $64 million in Q4. DSOs exiting Q4 were 101 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 83 days, also down 3 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. \r\nFinally, we repurchased $220 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program during Q4. As you have seen during -- in our press release, today, we announced a new authorization under our share repurchase program of up to $700 million, which includes $53 million remaining in the existing authorization. \r\nGiven the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the consistent cash flow generation of our business model, we plan to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares and offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances. \r\nNow turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. We estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $478 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $130 million in Q1. In terms of our operating plan, we plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount efficiently. \r\nSimilar to 2023, we expect to grow headcount at a rate slower than revenue growth. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to weight investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement. \r\nIn closing, I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023 and are set up in 2024. We are executing to capture growth within key secular drivers like CTV and shopper marketing. We're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath. Our international business is poised to continue helping drive our growth. We continue to gain share within the political vertical heading into the U.S. presidential election cycle. \r\nWe're adding more value for our customers with our biggest product release ever with Kokai, and we continue to innovate our platform. We enter 2024 in a strong position to grow and gain more share. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Shyam Patil with SIG.\n\nShyam Vasant Patil\n\nGreat job on the quarter and the results. I just had 1 question. Jeff, you talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks and Laura did as well. But could you just talk maybe a little bit more detail about how you view the state of the digital ad market today relative to how it was when you last reported, your competitive positioning and how investors should be thinking about your growth in 2024?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nAbsolutely. First, Shyam, thanks so much for the question. \r\nWith that, let me jump in to answer your question. So the current ad environment is really amazing for The Trade Desk because first of all, it is a buyer's market. So our competitive position couldn't be better because, of course, we focus on the buy side. And our buy side, while we look at 15 million ad impression opportunities every second, we're also doing that with objectivity. So the fact that we don't own any media makes it so that we can objectively figure out what to buy. And when you couple that with our technology and our client service, both are the best they've ever been and I think have pretty consistently been credited as being the best in the space.\r\nThat makes it possible for us to perform like we have, which is growing over 20% every quarter for the last 8 quarters. I don't think there's any scaled ad-funded company or walled garden, large or small, that can state that. And then, of course, we've got all these unique tailwinds that are helping the environment that are also helping us. \r\nThe first is that, of course, CTV, the shift continues to accelerate. And there's more and more going in to ads -- or I'm sorry, into ad-funded TV where subscribers that were focused -- or streamers that were focused on subscriptions that did not have ads are, for the first time ever, adopting ads and they're adopting them more rapidly than ever before.\r\nAnd I anticipate that over the next year or 2, we'll see that exact -- the same phenomenon happen in the most premium parts of audio. Then simultaneously, we have what's going on in retail media, where spend growth is also really strong. And then, of course, our -- some of the macro trends that have been making it a little harder for things to grow outside the United States are better than they've ever been, make it easier for them to grow, and we're seeing some green shoots that we didn't before in many of the markets outside of the United States.\r\nAnd then here in the U.S., this year is an election year so that also brings in more political spend. There's been a lot of discussion about cookie deprecation and the future of journalism as we've just seen lots of things happening in journalism that are negative, lots of layoffs, lots of journalists being laid off. But what that's driving people towards is a realization that there needs to be a consumer-friendly opt-in for authenticated traffic so that CPMs can not just stay the same but even get better.\r\nAnd so we're seeing just these amazing tailwinds around UID2. And then we're launching -- we're rolling out the most sophisticated product that we've ever built. I think it's the best upgrade that we've ever made to any product that we've ever built. \r\nAnd as a result, we expect a strong Q1 for the same reason that we outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last 8 quarters. So we feel like we're in an amazing position for 2024, and we expect to continue to grow and grab market share.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\n\nCongrats on the solid print. So Jeff, just as a follow-up to your ad-funded TV commentary, how do you think about the impact of Amazon's ad-supported Prime Video offering on the CTV market in general and Trade Desk's growth in particular? There are fears out there that just a massive influx of CTV inventory at a lower CPM could depress CPMs across the segment without necessarily driving more demand. So just how do you think about that for the industry and for you guys in particular?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nYou bet, thank you. So I don't think that the pool of inventory will be that massive. I do think it will be meaningful though, and it will further the supply or expand the supply. And -- But rather than not creating a huge imbalance, I do think we'll just slightly tip the scale a bit more, and I would say in a way, it officially tips the scale to a buyer's market where supply does outweigh demand. But I think overall, that's good for the ecosystem and it does create opportunity for us.\r\nThat does mean that CTV companies will have to compete more intensely to win attention and subscribers. That does mean that their ad experience needs to be better. That means fewer ads and more relevant ads. \r\nThe only way to do that is with programmatic. I believe that's part of the reason why every major streaming service that offers ads beyond their own sales team has adopted and announced partnership with UID2, and all of them are seeing higher CPMs as a result. So it does mean that the market is shaping in a way that gives more ads or more awards, more wins, if you will, to the companies that allow for UID2 to be used and allow for more relevant advertising.\r\nSo to me, the way that this ends for every successful streamer is to basically run an option that has identity attached to it, not so that they have to share any data about that impression or that user but so that an advertiser can bring their own data about that user, so that they can show a relevant ad and then the ad load can be lighter and more relevant, and then that creates the optimal experience for the streaming service.\r\nI think this move by Amazon will move in that direction. What they're doing is not that unique in my view. Yes, they're adding a greater amount of inventory. But they also have a dilemma, which is that unlike Netflix, who can raise their prices more regularly, because it's attached to Amazon Prime, it makes it harder for them to do that, which means they've got to play with a different dial, which is the volume of ads. And as a result, we will see them affect in the way the more competitive -- the competitive nature of the landscape because they're affecting the overall supply.\r\nBut again, I think that's good. It accelerates the rate. It will create a better experience for users. And it more clearly defines what the competition is all about, which is them running an [auction] that includes our participation because we largely represent the Fortune 500 and the most premium ads that you can bring to a quality streaming service. Thank you for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Shweta Khajuria from Evercore ISI.\n\nShweta R. Khajuria\n\nJeff, could you please comment on just your view or revised views, if there is one, on cookie deprecation. You -- We read your blog post on The Current on this a few weeks ago. Basically, there is a healthy level of debate on the impact cookie deprecation could have on Trade Desk especially as the year goes through. Could you please help us think through the puts and takes of that and why Trade Desk may not be as impacted or how much it would be impacted?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nYou bet, thanks Shweta. I appreciate the question. I'm actually -- I was hoping we would get asked this question so that we can talk about the topic. And I know there's been so much written in our space and even in the general public about cookie deprecation but also the product that Google has launched in Privacy Sandbox. Those 2 things are 2 separate things. I think it's important to talk about them differently. Even though I believe they're doing them at the same time for a reason, they are, in fact, 2 different things.\r\nSo cookies are being deprecated. That does mean that it makes it a little bit harder to create personalization if you do nothing. But as a result, everybody that touches that, some will be better off and some will be worse off. So -- And that especially is a reference to publishers. So there are many publishers that have almost 100% authentication. So almost everyone in CTV has almost 100% authentication and they are not affected by cookies.\r\nSo if you look at the 15 million ad opportunities every second and you look at the way that the dollars are divided up, a substantial amount of the dollars and the impressions that we care the most about often come from premium channels like audio and CTV, and those are almost always 100% authenticated. But then there's also millions that come from other channels that are also authenticated. So those 2 will get a premium, and those will -- those prices are going to go up. And it becomes more important that every publisher have an authentication strategy and an identity strategy.\r\nAnd so more and more publishers are talking about how they adopt UID2, how they adopt our single sign-on that we've launched publicly, although it's in closed beta right now called OpenPath. But what happens at the end of this is, we've seen from those that have reported what happens when you remove cookies is that their CPMs go down. We've heard numbers from 30% to 50%. So if you were getting $1 before, you're getting maybe $0.50, $0.60. If you look at the reports that we've shown on what happens if you use UID2, those go from $1 to $1.30.\r\nSo in a way, this is helping publishers to see the significance of both UID2 but also the need to change because on that small amount of traffic that Google has taken away cookies on, they see that deprecation and it's a lot easier to compare $0.60 to $1.30 or $1.40 than it is to compare $0.60 or $0.70 to $1. So that disparity makes it more likely that publishers will actually act on that.\r\nSo from our standpoint though, and this is the part that I think often people get wrong, when you're looking at 15 million ad opportunities every second, and let's just say that we have identity just to keep numbers around half of it. And if that's going to go down by 10%-ish or 10% to 15%, which represents, let's just say, the exact amount of our display business, which is where cookies come from. And if it's in that 10% to 15% range, but we have some forms of authentication on a significant portion of that, you're looking at like 8%, 9% that we wouldn't have access to anymore, maybe call it, 10%, okay? Well, then of that 15 million instead of looking at 7 million, 7.5 million. We look at 6.5 million.\r\nWhat does that change about our overall business? Almost nothing. So I think many have not understood that this is affecting those in the ecosystem at very different rates. And really, this is a revaluing of the Internet, and that some sites are becoming more valuable and some are becoming less valuable. And just like anything in equities markets, when you revalue it, the people who are in charge of assigning that value or doing the buying and selling, that's an opportunity for them to add value. \r\nAnd this, for us, is an opportunity for us to add value. We are helping our buyers figure out what to buy. And I would argue we're adding more value than we ever have as a result of it. And so as a result, this is very good for us. Thank you so much for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nUp next, we have Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research.\n\nVasily Karasyov\n\nJeff, thank you for the helpful color on the cookie deprecation issue. In a related topic, can you set the record straight on Privacy Sandbox? What is your view and what is Trade Desk testing there? What does it even matter to you? Because there's been some discussion in the industry press, there is some confusion, I would say.\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nThanks, Vasily. I appreciate the question. And as was mentioned previously, I have written fairly extensively on Privacy Sandbox on our news platform, The Current. So if anybody wants to read more details, there's also a great report by Bill Simmons, who was previously the CTO of Dataxu which was acquired by Roku, who also had just a great POV on this also on The Current.\r\nSo as I mentioned before, there's 2 different things happening at roughly at the same time. There's cookie deprecation, which is Chrome is removing the use of third-party cookies and they're doing that gradually. They introduced 1% and that created a lot of fuss in discussion about it. But really, as an industry so far, we -- at the beginning of the year, 35% of cookies were already gone because of Safari and Firefox and now it's 36% or something like that. So it wasn't a dramatic move but the fear that it's going to go from 36% to 100% removal has lots of people concerned.\r\nI think it even has Google concerned who is doing this because they fear that they're taking something away and they're not replacing it with anything, which gives their engineers a very difficult dilemma. What do we replace it with? So what they're proposing to replace it with is this product called Privacy Sandbox. Now it's a series of different APIs. There's actually more products than just Privacy Sandbox, but everyone in our industry just talks about that umbrella of APIs as Privacy Sandbox.\r\nI really believe that Google has missed an opportunity to build something better than this. They are increasing the complexity and they are deprecating at the same time. So I just -- I don't think any good product ever deprecates an ecosystem and makes it more complicated at the same time. So I've been fairly critical of that. Some have asked some of our leaders, if we're going to test it? And some of our leaders have publicly said, we're not going to test it. And then I publicly said, we are going to test it.\r\nAnd the reason we're going to test it is I just don't think you get to be a food critic if you're not willing to taste food. So yes, we've been fairly critical of it, and yes, I don't think it's a good product but we have to try. And this may be the most iterated-on product that I've ever seen from Google so they keep changing it a lot. So it is actually hard to keep up with. But the broad strokes haven't changed a lot. And the product is continually disappointed as you'll read from most op-ed outside of Google.\r\nGoogle says it's great. Everyone else says, it's not. I think it's incredibly complex. I think it's not fully understood by more than 10 people on the planet. It's really complicated. But it is not that hard to see that this is a deprecation to the Internet. It is a deprecation to the Chrome user experience. And then, of course, there's lots of speculation about what Google's motives are in doing all these things at this exact moment when they're under a tremendous amount of pressure. But that's a totally different topic.\r\nBut as far as our position on Privacy Sandbox, we don't think it's a good product, but we will test it, hope that it gets better. I would love for Google to innovate instead of deprecate. But in the event that they don't, it does give us a lot more traction around UID2, and The Trade Desk is going to be fine no matter what. \r\nSo I'm only invested to the point that I deeply care about the open Internet and would really like to see themes like journalism thrive, and I am very concerned about the impact that cookies will have on things like journalism that are pretty dependent on browser-based traffic. \r\nSo with that, I'll move on to the next question. Thank you for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research.\n\nDaniel Salmon\n\nOkay, great. I've got 2 questions. Jeff, you mentioned your single sign-on initiative, OpenPath, in the press release and your prepared remarks for the first time in recent memory. Could you talk a little bit more about that initiative? It's important to your identity and authentication strategy and maybe more specifically how it works together with UID2. And then the second, just maybe for Laura on this one, but also in the prepared remarks, Jeff mentioned that JVPs now represent 1/3 of your business. Can you give us any more detail on how that breaks down between agencies and direct client relationships?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nYou bet. So first, let me take a minute to explain where we're at with OpenPath. So first, this is in a closed invite-only beta and you're right, we haven't talked about it a lot. There have been a number of things where people are watching us closely lately and we've been scooped or people talk about it before we get a chance to talk about it. I think this was one of them.\r\nBut let me explain what it is, first of all. So if you have ever used Shopify, I think that's the easiest way to understand it. I'm a big fan of Shopify, the -- both the company and the product itself. The first time you use Shopify, you go through a checkout process that feels just like any ordinary checkout process. You actually don't even necessarily see the value. I actually think it was brilliant that Shopify, at least the way I experienced it, never took the time to explain what they were doing. I just experienced it, that was the fastest way to get people to adopt it, was to get a few merchants to do it.\r\nAnd then where you really see the beauty of their sign-up process is the second time you go to a merchant and you see Shopify there. And then you see how much faster the checkout process is. And then if you're like me, say, how did they do that? Where did they get the information? How is it secure? And then I'm literally putting together floor charts to understand how this worked and realize that both, it's faster and more secure than what I had before, and it was just genius. It's kind of the opposite of what I was just criticizing in Google's products in Privacy Sandbox where it complicates and deprecates. This is something that makes it both easier and more secure.\r\nAnd when you get both of those things together, then it's amazing. So that's exactly what we're doing with the SSO, which is we are trying to make it easier for people to sign on to websites. So the most lightweight. It's not joined with an e-mail service. We're not launching something like Gmail. But instead, we've created this product that is OpenPath. We have a few publishers that have signed up during this invite-only beta. So of course, we run it on The Current, our own product, but also on Snopes and OK! Magazine and RadarOnline.\r\nAnd a few early adopters who want to try this and the results have been really fantastic. And again, where you really see the benefit is when you go to a second or third or fourth site after you've been to that first one. So we recognize that the way to get this network effect is to partner with some of the biggest companies in the world that have sign-ons and also have a desire to make the ads on their site more relevant and more competitive with more bidders than just Google. And so we think our value proposition is really compelling and especially once you get that flywheel spinning, then it becomes almost financially irresponsible for people not to sign up in that we can bring them higher CPM.\r\nSo we're very excited about the early results. We have some big ideas about how to rapidly create adoption, and we're excited about what that represents for things like journalism if we can get this to the scale that we want it to be. Laura, the second part of the question is for you.\n\nLaura Schenkein\n\nYes. Thanks, Dan. On the topic of JVPs, they absolutely continue to be a key driver of spend growth in our business. And as we noted, about 1/3 of our spend was under JVP exiting 2023. And we had, I believe exiting the year, over 45 JVPs with a robust pipeline of addition to that. .\r\nThose JVPs represent billions of dollars of future spend. And what gets me most excited about them is that those JVPs are helping us get closer to our clients. And to your point, that's both brands and agencies who are signing up to do things that will drive incremental ROI for their marketing budgets. It can be anything from increasing data usage to adopting UID2 to focusing on decision CTV spend and I can go on and on.\r\nAnd the way that we look at those is that they're effectively a win-win for The Trade Desk, a win-win for the agency and for the brand, where their structure and framework that works best for their business. We don't actually break down the percent that's coming from the agency versus coming from the brand. And the main reason for that is that even the JVPs that we're signing with our brands, we are talking to the agencies that are working hand-in-hand with the brand as we are structuring those JVPs. And our relationships with agencies have never been stronger.\r\nSo we just constantly say we're never losing sight of the key role that our agencies play in helping our brands execute their business. And for that reason, we don't really look at it as a breakdown but more in terms of how can we get closer to all parties that are spending on our platform.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMatthew Andrew Cost\n\nI have 2. The first 1 is just on the conversation with advertisers. So at the time that you guided to the fourth quarter, I think you had seen, at least in certain verticals, some brand spend weakness through October and November, but obviously the quarter came in significantly ahead of your guidance at that time. So I guess how did the conversation evolve with advertisers? Where did you see them lean in, in ways that you didn't expect? And how has that trended through the beginning of 2024?\r\nAnd then the second question is just on the growth outside the U.S. I think there's a comment before about seeing green shoots there and continued faster growth than inside the U.S. I guess, are there specific ways that advertiser behavior or the inventory are changing that you would call out?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nYou bet. Thank you for the question. I'm just writing it down so I don't forget. So yes, in Q4, early in Q4, there was a little bit more, I would say, hesitation in the ecosystem and the landscape, and I think that was not isolated to advertising. I think that was just macroeconomic angst, if you will. But of course, for the last few years, and I would just say that the angst in the CFO's office has been more closely connected to the angst in the CMO's office really since the pandemic at a level that I haven't seen in my career.\r\nSo I think there was some angst early on. And as the quarter went on, we saw some advertisers really lean in and some advertisers see some pressure. And even as we completed the quarter, it really is a tale of 2 cities, where some companies are really driving for growth and spending aggressively to go get growth, and some are watching every penny carefully and trying to be really deliberate. And that meant some spent more and some spent less. And in the end, we have an increase in spend obviously beyond what we guided.\r\nAs it relates to outside the United States, I think a significant amount of this is caused by the same macro environment that we were just talking about. So as things change in the dollar and some of the macroeconomic policies of governments, I think that does make it easier for things outside the United States to do well. But there's also some trends in media consumption. So if you look at places like the U.K. or Germany, we see their CTV growth meaningfully higher than what we're experiencing in the U.S.\r\nAnd that's often because they're a year or 2 behind the U.S. in terms of the competitive landscape, forcing the change to ad-funded models and some of those types of things. But we're seeing the exact same trends play out. So in the same way that we saw those green shoots a couple of years ago here in the United States, we're now starting to see them in more markets around the world, and that's very good for us. So I would say it's those 2 things on the international or outside the U.S. front. Thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital.\n\nMatthew John Swanson\n\nI'll add my congratulations to you guys on the quarter. So Jeff, I think from the product event, when we were talking about Kokai, 1 thing that was really intriguing to investors was this idea of being able to deliver attribution and KPIs and kind of segmented out throughout the funnel, right, not just give it all to the last click. It kind of sounded like the example you gained from Samsung.\r\nSo when you've been out meeting with customers, can you just talk a little bit about like what's exciting them the most about Kokai? What's driving adoption and maybe how this new way of looking at attribution could kind of change spending patterns longer term?\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nYou bet. So first of all, thank you for the question. And there's so many things to talk about in it because there's just so many things that are inside of Kokai. So if you don't know, and obviously, I know at RBC, you know this but maybe some others on the call don't. We went on what we call a world tour at the end of Q4 to go to 4 continents and talk to our customers around the world about the product that we're launching.\r\nHonestly, I did that out of concern in the sense that I know we are giving them more change than ever, but I am confident that this is an upgrade in almost every way to our platform. And I was concerned that the amount of change would make them afraid of adopting something new simply because of how much it changed rather than really considering all the reasons why we did it. And so we spent half a day in -- on 4 continents. We did, I think, 3 in the United States, in L.A. and Chicago and New York, and then we also did in London and we also did in Singapore and also did in Australia.\r\nAnd the reception was phenomenal. It really put to bed any concerns that I had about reluctance for adoption. We explained the reasons why we were doing everything. A big part of what they love, to answer your question about what are they most excited about, is we have streamlined our reporting. We've made it way faster. There are some reports that you just have to wait multiple minutes for it because they're just so robust, and we found ways to accelerate that.\r\nWe've also added AI throughout the platform, especially in forecasting. So it's a little bit like if you were to make a hypothetical trade in a trading platform for equity and then us tell you what we think is going to happen to the price action in the next 10 minutes. So we're showing them what the effects of their changes are going to be before they even make them so that they don't make mistakes. Because sometimes what happens is people put out a campaign. They'll put tight restrictions on it. They'll hope that it spends, then they come back a day or 2 or even 3 later and then realize they made it so difficult with their combination of targeting and pricing for us to buy anything that they didn't spend much money. Or the opposite because they spent more and it wasn't as effective as they wanted.\r\nSo helping them see all of that before they do anything helped. And then we put data and decisions next to each other in a better way than we ever have before. But included in those decisions are upgrades to the attribution methodologies and reporting. \r\nSo we are definitely trying to do a better job of attribution, while at the same time, not adding complexity. It's a very difficult thing to do in our space. It's hard when you want to give people more power, give them the ability to do more, usually, that means you hand them more complexity. And how can we give them more power and yet not increase the number of buttons exponentially, not increase the number of numbers on the screen exponentially?\r\nSo we think we've threaded that needle and we'll continue to simplify. But those are the things that they're most excited about, and that's part of the reason why I go into this earnings report with so much confidence is just spending so much time with our customers over the last 4 months.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brian Pitz with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nTimothy Larkin O'Shea\n\nYes, it's Tim O'Shea on for Brian. We've spoken about the impact of cookie deprecation but what about timing and readiness? You work with so many advertisers, all the agencies. The question is, do you believe that advertisers are ready for Google to deprecate the remaining 99% of cookies in 2024? And if they aren't ready, what needs to be done? What is being done to prepare them? And then maybe just what happens to the ad market if Google decides to deprecate right before the holidays in the U.S. presidential election? I'm curious, is there a pause? Is there a pullback? I know that Jeff spoke about what happened when Apple made similar policy changes in the past.\n\nJeffrey Terry Green\n\nYou bet. I love this question. Thank you very much for asking it. So of course, the answer is, some are, some aren't. So who is ready for cookie deprecation? So I believe here at The Trade Desk, we're in a phenomenal position. As a company, a big part of our technology stack centers around what we call an identity graph, and that is incredibly robust and that is a result of our efforts.\r\nAnd as you will recall, we launched UID2 before the pandemic. We launched UID before that. And all of those efforts were us seeing around corners and we knew that this would happen. So we're confident that we're in a fantastic position. As it relates to advertisers, some are prepared and some are not. I would say the majority are not doing as much as they can. If I were to just paint a picture of the typical advertiser, they've adopted something like Snowflake. They have been trying to take their data from 20 different silos all over their organization, and they're trying to figure out how to make certain that they're respecting their relationship with the consumer.\r\nAnd I do want to underline, I've never been a big brand that doesn't start every one of these discussions by saying, I want to be really careful about respecting the privacy of my consumer. They want a long-term relationship with them. They want to sell soap or cheeseburgers or pizza or whatever to them over and over again, and so they want to be respectful. And as they're doing that, they're trying to figure out how to bring it all together and make certain that they keep it all safe.\r\nMany, as they're doing that internally are saying, we know we have to put first-party data to work but we have to really think about the implications of what they do. And many have started to do that and many have not finished it, there's a lot of internal meetings that have to happen and they all have to move more quickly. The thing that's been good about all the discussions to date is it's getting everybody to move a bit more quickly and say, hey, we have to act. And so I think that is super healthy.\r\nBut if I were to estimate, I would say most advertisers are not as ready as they could be, but the 25% that are, are going to benefit if Google were to go faster. The side of this that I'm really worried about though it is -- is the publisher side. Again, we don't represent publishers directly. We represent the buy side. But of course, we buy from all these publishers, and we want to see an open Internet thrive. But I would say that 90% of publishers that have a meaningful amount of their traffic from browsers are not prepared at all.\r\nAnd so you would see a rapid revaluing and you would see some struggle come as a result of Google accelerating cookies. It could have a meaningful impact on the election in the sense that if people can't advertise on those sites effectively, then the prices would go down. And then it would change the way that they either generate content or even their ability to afford to continue to generate content on those journalistic outlets. \r\nTo me, they're the ones to watch most carefully because I think they're the ones that are often hurt the most as we've just seen so many headlines in journalism of layoffs of late.\r\nAnd so I do think it's really prudent to be thinking about the pace that Google is going. I think they're trying to recognize all of these implications, and they don't want to have to testify before Congress in 2 years about what did you do to journalism or anything like that. So as a result, like them deprecating cookies 1% at this point is a good way to get people to act. And now the important thing is for advertisers and publishers to act. And I think that's going to give tons of additional momentum to things like UID2 and OpenPath. And that's one of the many reasons why I'm just so confident about our 2024.\n\nChris Toth\n\nThanks for the question. And John, can you close out the call, please? Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

        "title": "Decoding The Trade Desk Inc (TTD): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Strengths: Innovative technology and strong market presence in programmatic advertising. Weaknesses: Dependence on advertising agencies and susceptibility to market fluctuations. Opportunities: Expansion into emerging digital channels and global market growth. Threats: Intense competition and evolving privacy regulations.\n\nOn February 15, 2024, The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing the company's financial performance and strategic positioning. As a leading provider of a self-service platform for programmatic advertising, The Trade Desk has demonstrated robust growth, with a 43% average annual revenue increase since its IPO in 2016. The company's financial tables from the filing highlight a strong balance sheet, with operating margins ranging from 10% to 28%, showcasing its profitability and financial stability in a competitive digital ad industry. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the 10-K filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of The Trade Desk's market position and future prospects.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with TTD. Decoding The Trade Desk Inc (TTD): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nTechnological Leadership and Innovation: The Trade Desk's platform is a testament to its commitment to technological innovation, offering clients predictive models, performance optimization, and real-time analytics. This has positioned the company as a leader in programmatic advertising, where it competes on the strength of its platform's performance, capabilities, and transparency. The company's ability to refresh its platform weekly demonstrates agility and a focus on aligning product development with client needs, a significant competitive advantage in the fast-paced digital advertising landscape.\n\nStrong Client Relationships and Market Presence: The Trade Desk's business model, based on ongoing master service agreements (MSAs) rather than campaign-specific insertion orders, fosters long-term client relationships. With a client base that includes some of the largest advertising agencies globally, The Trade Desk has secured a strong market presence. Its focus on the buy side of the industry and the provision of comprehensive access to a wide range of inventory types and third-party data vendors further solidify its market position.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Advertising Agencies: The Trade Desk's business model is heavily reliant on advertising agencies, which could pose a risk if these agencies experience downturns or shift their preferences. The loss of significant agency clients could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations, as indicated in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the 10-K filing.\n\nMarket Sensitivity and Seasonality: The company's performance is subject to market uncertainties, downturns, and seasonal fluctuations in advertising activity. These factors could negatively impact revenue, cash flow, and results of operations, particularly in the first quarter, which historically reflects the lowest level of advertising activity for The Trade Desk.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion into Emerging Digital Channels: The Trade Desk is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift towards digital media and the fragmentation of audiences. The company's omnichannel capabilities and expansion into emerging channels such as connected TV (CTV), audio, and digital-out-of-home present significant growth opportunities. The ongoing global expansion and development of programmatic capabilities are expected to drive the adoption of The Trade Desk's platform by new clients and increase revenue from existing ones.\n\nGlobal Market Growth: The Trade Desk's international expansion strategy, particularly in Europe and Asia, presents opportunities for growth in untapped markets. Despite potential challenges related to local regulations and foreign investment, the company's investments in sales, marketing, and product development are poised to capture a larger share of the global advertising spend.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Landscape: The digital advertising market is intensely competitive, with The Trade Desk facing competition from both smaller, privately held companies and divisions of large, established corporations like Google and Adobe. The company's ability to maintain its competitive edge relies on continuous innovation and the performance of its platform.\n\nEvolving Privacy Regulations and Industry Self-Regulation: The Trade Desk operates in a regulatory environment that is increasingly focused on privacy and data protection. Changes in laws, enforcement actions, or self-regulatory rules could impose additional costs, lead to investigations, or necessitate changes in the platform or business model, potentially affecting the company's growth and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, The Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ:TTD) exhibits a strong foundation with its innovative technology, solid client relationships, and significant market presence. However, the company must navigate its dependence on advertising agencies, market sensitivity, and intense competition. Opportunities for expansion into emerging digital channels and global markets are countered by threats from evolving privacy regulations and industry self-regulation. The Trade Desk's strategic investments and focus on technological innovation position it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic digital advertising industry.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

On top of that, next quarter's revenue guidance ($478 million at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 5.7% above what analysts were expecting.

Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $605.8 million vs analyst estimates of $582.2 million (4% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.41 vs analyst expectations of $0.43 (4.6% miss) Revenue Guidance for Q1 2024 is $478 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $452.3 million Adjusted EBITDA Guidance for Q1 2024 is $130 million at the midpoint, well above analyst estimates of $113 million Free Cash Flow of $63.79 million, down 65.3% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 83.4%, in line with the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $36.43 billion\n\n\u201cOnce again The Trade Desk outpaced nearly all areas of digital advertising in 2023, with $1.95 billion of revenue representing 23% growth year over year and a record $9.6 billion of spend on our platform. At the same time, we continue to generate significant profitability and cash flow, which allows us to remain at the bleeding edge of our industry, with innovations such as Kokai. Our results are testament to the growing value that advertisers are placing on the open internet versus the limitations of walled gardens,\u201d said Jeff Green, founder and CEO of The Trade Desk.\n\nFounded by former Microsoft engineers Jeff Green and Dave Pickles, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) offers cloud-based software that uses data to help advertisers better plan, place, and target their online ads.\n\nAdvertising Software\n\nThe digital advertising market is large, growing, and becoming more diverse, both in terms of audiences and media. As a result, there is a growing need for software that enables advertisers to use data to automate and optimize ad placements.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, The Trade Desk's revenue growth has been strong over the last two years, growing from $395.6 million in Q4 FY2021 to $605.8 million this quarter. The Trade Desk Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, The Trade Desk's quarterly revenue was once again up a very solid 23.4% year on year. On top of that, its revenue increased $112.5 million quarter on quarter, a very strong improvement from the $29.01 million increase in Q3 2023. This is a sign of acceleration of growth and great to see.\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that The Trade Desk is expecting revenue to grow 24.9% year on year to $478 million, improving on the 21.4% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. The Trade Desk's free cash flow came in at $63.79 million in Q4, down 48.1% year on year. The Trade Desk Free Cash Flow\n\nThe Trade Desk has generated $543.3 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 27.9% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance.\n\nKey Takeaways from The Trade Desk's Q4 Results\n\nWe were impressed by The Trade Desk's revenue guidance and rosy outlook for next quarter, which blew past analysts' expectations for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA--a key profit measure. We were also glad its gross margin improved. Zooming out, the company is growing faster than the digital ad market, telling us that The Trade Desk is taking share. And the company is doing so profitably. We think this was a very impressive quarter that should delight shareholders. The stock is up 22.4% after reporting and currently trades at $92.68 per share.\n\nThe Trade Desk may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

And with the launch of Kokai, we are bringing more value to advertisers with the industry\u2019s most advanced, intuitive media buying platform.\"\n\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights:\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results for the quarters and fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 GAAP Results Revenue $ 606 $ 491 $ 1,946 $ 1,578 Increase in revenue year over year 23 % 24 % 23 % 32 % Net income $ 97 $ 71 $ 179 $ 53 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.19 $ 0.14 $ 0.36 $ 0.11 Non-GAAP Results Adjusted EBITDA $ 284 $ 245 $ 772 $ 668 Adjusted EBITDA margin 47 % 50 % 40 % 42 % Non-GAAP net income $ 207 $ 190 $ 628 $ 522 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.41 $ 0.38 $ 1.26 $ 1.04\n\nFourth Quarter and 2023 Recent Business Highlights\n\nContinued Share Gains: 2023 gross spend of $9.6 billion.

With its integration of UID2, device and software company HP has seen improved targeting on CTV, and as a result, the company has reduced wasted advertising spend. In September, Philo adopted UID2 across its roster of premium streaming TV channels. Warner Bros. Discovery announced integration with UID2 across its premium entertainment, sports, news and lifestyle brands with its digital platforms, including Max and Discovery+. Walmart Connect announced it is testing the integration of UID2 to inform decisioning across the open internet within the Walmart DSP. EUID, the European counterpart to UID2 specifically developed for the European market, is gaining support across Europe from brands, publishers, and retailers. Initial industry engagement includes Bacardi, Kimberly-Clark, Aller Media, Future, OneFootball, Prisma Media, Tesco and others. On stage at Forward \u201923: Always On, NBCUniversal announced it is implementing UID2 on Peacock across all devices and consumer touchpoints, including on CTV, the web, apps and devices.

The Company repurchased approximately $647 million of its Class A common stock in the year ended December 31, 2023, at an average repurchase price of $63.87.

The Company expects the variability of the above charges could have a significant and potentially unpredictable impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nIncluded within this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS that supplement the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Company prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest income, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP Net Income excludes charges and the related income tax effects for stock-based compensation. Tax rates on the tax-deductible portions of the stock-based compensation expense approximating 25% to 30% have been used in the computation of non-GAAP Net Income and non-GAAP Diluted EPS. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company\u2019s management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company's operational trends, financial performance and cash-generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company\u2019s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for or superior to corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Webcast and Conference Call Details\n\nWhen: February 15, 2024 at 2:00 P.M.

These statements relate to expectations concerning matters that (a) are not historical facts, (b) predict or forecast future events or results or (c) embody assumptions that may prove to have been inaccurate, including statements relating to industry and market trends, the Company\u2019s financial targets, such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and the amount, timing and sources of funding for the Company\u2019s share repurchase program. When words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"will\", \"outlook\" or similar expressions are used, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot give readers any assurance that such expectations will prove correct. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the Company\u2019s relatively limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate the Company\u2019s business and prospects, the market for programmatic advertising developing slower or differently than the Company\u2019s expectations, the demands and expectations of clients and the ability to attract and retain clients. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. These are disclosed in the Company\u2019s reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Form 10-K and any subsequent filings on Forms 10-Q or 8-K, available at www.sec.gov. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company does not intend to update any forward-looking statement contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof.\n\nTHE TRADE DESK,

        "content": "What To Expect From The Trade Desk\u2019s (TTD) Q4 Earnings\n\nAdvertising software maker The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here's what investors should know.\n\nLast quarter The Trade Desk reported revenues of $493.3 million, up 24.9% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 1.2%. It was a weaker quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\n\nIs The Trade Desk buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting The Trade Desk's revenue to grow 18.6% year on year to $582.2 million, slowing down from the 24% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.43 per share. The Trade Desk Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company only missed Wall St's revenue estimates once over the last two years, and has on average exceeded top line expectations by 2.3%.\n\nLooking at The Trade Desk's peers in the sales and marketing software segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint what we can expect. LiveRamp delivered top-line growth of 9.6% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 1.2% and GoDaddy reported revenues up 5.8% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 0.1%. LiveRamp traded down 2.3% on the results, and GoDaddy was flat on the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of LiveRamp's results here and GoDaddy's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the sales and marketing software segment, with the stocks up on average 3.6% over the last month. The Trade Desk is up 14.5% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $77.9, compared to share price of $72.9.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "content": "The Trade Desk TTD is set to release its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 15.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues of at least $580 million, indicating growth of 18% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is currently pegged at $582.19 million, suggesting an 18.64% increase year over year.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is estimated to be 42 cents per share, indicating 10.53% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 25.28% on average.\n\nThe Trade Desk Price and EPS Surprise The Trade Desk Price and EPS Surprise\n\nThe Trade Desk price-eps-surprise | The Trade Desk Quote\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for this announcement:\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s top-line growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have been backed by a significant increase in digital spending in key areas such as Connected TV (CTV) and retail media.\r\n\r\nTTD is expanding footprint among marketers who are increasingly spending more on premium video like CTV. In the third quarter, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of The Trade Desk's business and continues to grow as a percentage of its mix.\r\n\r\nImproving ad spending environment bodes well for The Trade Desk. The company is expected to have benefited from its expanding footprint in international markets across Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s expanding partner base, which includes the likes of Walmart, Target, Albertsons and Instacart, has fueled the expansion of the company\u2019s addressable market in the United States. This is expected to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "title": "Is It Time To Consider Buying The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD)?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGM. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Trade Desk\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Trade Desk?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Trade Desk today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $86.70, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Trade Desk\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Trade Desk generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Trade Desk's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TTD\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on TTD, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 In Right Now",
        "content": "For some, $1,000 might not seem like enough money to invest to get a great return in the stock market. But if you have a long enough investment time horizon and pick the right investment, $1,000 could eventually grow into $1 million. Buying stocks like Amazon, Home Depot, Microsoft, and Berkshire Hathaway at the right time has all delivered such returns to early investors.\n\nNow is also a great time to invest as the artificial intelligence (AI) bull market has just become official, with the S&P 500 regularly hitting new all-time highs. If you've got $1,000 to invest -- about a week's paycheck for the average American -- here are two great stocks to put that money to work in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Broadcom: a long-term AI winner\n\nChip stock Broadcom (NASDAQ: A VGO) hasn't gotten nearly as much attention as peers Nvidia or even Advanced Micro Devices in the AI race, and it's easy to see why. The company's recent results have been modest, and it doesn't specialize in the kind of GPU and related processors that have made Nvidia so in demand.\n\nInstead, the company is known for networking and connectivity solutions such as routers, switches, and network adapters, which are expected to play a role in the AI boom. While revenue grew just 4% year over year in the most recent quarter to $9.3 billion, management said it's seeing demand build for networking components for generative AI.\n\nIn the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), generative AI revenue, including ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators, made up close to $1.5 billion in revenue, or about 20% of its semiconductor revenue. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024, the company expects networking revenue growth to accelerate to 30%, and it sees generative AI representing more than 25% of semiconductor revenue.\n\nBroadcom is also highly profitable, a strong indication of competitive advantages in its corner of the semiconductor sector, and CEO Hock Tan is known for running a lean operation. In the fourth quarter, Broadcom reported a 65% margin based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock also trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 29, and its growth will get a boost this year from its recent acquisition of VMWare, a maker of virtualization software. Broadcom also has a long-term record of outperforming the market, and it's a good bet that will continue.\n\n2. The Trade Desk: Leading the digital advertising transition\n\nAI may be the most important growth trend in the stock market, but digital advertising has been another source of huge growth. While Alphabet and Meta Platforms are two of the most obvious winners, ad tech companies have also seen significant growth, and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is the leading independent ad tech platform.\n\nAfter a lull during the 2022 bear market, there are signs that digital ad spending is starting to spring back to life. Alphabet and Meta both reported accelerating revenue growth for the quarter, and most economists now believe that the economy will avoid a recession, which should help persuade brands to spend more on advertising.\n\nThe Trade Desk is well-positioned to take advantage of the next advertising boom. First, the company's Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) protocol is the leading candidate to replace third-party cookies on Google Chrome, which are expected to disappear by the second half of the year.\n\nIt's also launched its own AI platform, Kokai, which distributes deep learning algorithms across the digital media buying process, improving measurement data, user interface, and return on investment, by choosing the right ad impressions at the right price. While management announced Kokai last year, it's planning on making most of the new features available this year, and that should help drive the company's growth and keep it ahead of the competition.\n\nFinally, Trade Desk has managed to deliver strong growth through a challenging period in its industry, and the stock is trading at a discount after it sold off because of weak guidance in its third-quarter earnings report. That gives investors a great opportunity to buy the stock at a good price, as the company looks well positioned for a strong 2024, especially with the recovery in the digital advertising industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 is a stock market index comprised of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Many investors refer to it as an index of the 100 largest technology companies in America.\n\nOwing to its make-up, the Nasdaq 100 tends to outperform other stock market indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. It also tends to do better than the broader Nasdaq index that includes more than 2,500 stocks. Owing to its concentration in the largest and most profitable tech stocks, the Nasdaq 100 can be a great exchange-traded fund (ETF) to own.\n\nYet despite its outperformance, the Nasdaq 100 is not infallible. There are several stocks in the index that have been beaten down in recent years and trade at low share prices and cheap valuations. Here are the three most undervalued Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy in February 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) just got knocked 11% lower after the financial technology and payments company issued weak forward guidance. The guidance overshadowed the fact that PayPal reported much better-than-expected fourth-quarter financial results, posting earnings per share (EPS) of $1.48 compared to $1.36 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter came in at $8.03 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $7.87 billion.\n\nUnfortunately, PayPal provided disappointing guidance, sending its stock lower as a result. The company said that it anticipates full-year earnings of $5.10 a share, which is below the $5.48 that analysts had expected. The latest earnings report comes after PayPal announced plans to layoff 9% of its workforce to help reduce costs. PayPal faces growing competition for its payment service from technology giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nPYPL stock is now down 28% over the last 12 months and trading at just 14 times future earnings estimates, which is rock bottom for a tech stock of its size.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) also got clobbered after the company\u2019s last earnings print. TTD stock fell 25% after the advertising technology firm issued revenue guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates. While the company\u2019s Q3 2023 financial results beat forecasts, they too were overshadowed by subpar guidance. The Trade Desk forecast revenue in the fourth quarter of last year of $580 million, which was below the $610 million expected among analysts.\n\nManagement said that the advertising market was hurt last year by strikes in the U.S. automotive sector and entertainment industry. The Trade Desk\u2019s technology helps companies reach potential customers across the internet with targeted advertisements. While the outlook for the final months of last year was grim, there is expected to be a rebound in online ads this year with the presidential election getting into full-swing.\n\nTTD stock has slumped 13% in the last six months, but the shares could stage a recovery when the company reports its Q4 2023 results on Feb. 15.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a microchip and semiconductor stock, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has had a tough go of it. TXN stock is down nearly 10% in the last 12 months, including a 5% decline so far in 2024. Compare that to a 60% gain in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) over the past year. Despite designing the chips and semiconductors that go into products ranging from motor vehicles to consumer electronics, Texas Instruments and its stock continue to lag the market.\n\nTXN stock has been slumping ever since the company issued tepid forward guidance that left analysts and investors feeling underwhelmed. Texas Instruments said that it anticipates $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion in revenue for the current first quarter of 2024, and 96 cents to $1.16 in EPS. Analysts had a consensus Q1 forecast of $4.05 billion in revenue and $1.40 a share in profit. Management said that demand remains weak and that customers will reduce their microchip inventories over the coming year.\n\nWhile the current situation with TXN stock is disappointing, the shares currently trade at 22 times future earnings estimates, which is about as low as a person is likely to find in a chip stock these days. Texas Instruments also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share, giving the stock a strong yield of 3.25%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in AAPL.

        "title": "Is The Market Rewarding The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) With A Negative Sentiment As A Result Of Its Mixed Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) has had a rough three months with its share price down 9.4%. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on Trade Desk's  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:\n\n7.1% = US$153m \u00f7 US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.07 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nTrade Desk's Earnings Growth And 7.1% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Trade Desk's ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 9.9% either. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Trade Desk over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Trade Desk's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is TTD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TTD is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Trade Desk Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nTrade Desk doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. However, this doesn't explain why the company hasn't seen any growth. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Trade Desk. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

        "title": "3 Must-Own IoT Stocks to Cash in on the Data Explosion",
        "content": "With data generation exploding thanks to AI, IoT, and other innovative technologies, tech\u2019s brightest stars have lit up Wall Street in recent months. But the biggest gains may still be ahead for this group, as this data explosion kicks into overdrive. That\u2019s why I think savvy investors should start positioning their portfolios to profit from surging data demand now.\n\nThe best way to play this trend is to own the top companies enabling and harnessing all this data. I\u2019m talking about the leading cloud computing and storage providers powering today\u2019s data-hungry AI systems and internet-connected devices. As the need for speed and storage capacity increases, these cutting-edge innovators stand to grow even faster.\n\nOf course, with tech valuations stretched and competition remaining fierce, risks abound. We could see speed bumps along the way. But the long-term trajectory for AI and IoT data usage remains overwhelmingly positive. Wall Street is slapping massive premiums on these stocks for a reason.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its iron grip on cloud computing, it\u2019s no wonder Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at a premium valuation. Commanding 31% total market share of the red-hot cloud infrastructure space that drove $73.7 billion in fourth quarter revenue alone, AWS shows no signs of loosening its stranglehold on this space any time soon.\n\nIn fact, AWS grew a solid 13% year-over-year last quarter, hitting analyst targets. As the overall cloud infrastructure market marches toward more than $100 billion in (likely) less than two years, I expect AWS to keep pace or even see its growth rate accelerate. Amazon\u2019s stock should ride higher along with AWS\u2019s success.\n\nNot only does AWS enable Amazon\u2019s dominance in e-commerce, but it also powers many of the hottest tech trends. Expanding traction in areas like AI, machine learning, IoT, and other cloud services provides additional growth runways for the e-commerce giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith all these catalysts aligned, I remain confident in Amazon\u2019s staying power. The company sits at the intersection of several massive secular growth trends that show no sign of slowing. For these reasons, I view AMZN stock as a long-term winner that will keep compounding over time.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) a programmatic ad is served up on a smartphone\n\nSource: shutterstock.com\n\nAs targeted digital advertising leans more heavily on ever-growing data stockpiles, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) stands ready to cash in big time. While not an outright AI or cloud infrastructure play, The Trade Desk benefits enormously from the accelerating demand for consumer data to power precision ad targeting.\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s platform enables advertisers to deliver highly-relevant, personalized, and impactful ads by analyzing user behaviors, demographics, and interests. With data holding the keys to next-level advertising effectiveness, it\u2019s no shocker The Trade Desk boasts steep long-term growth forecasts. Analysts expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to grow at roughly 20% per year for the foreseeable future, with revenue growth rates coming in around the same range.\n\nEven with a valuation that appears stretched at 54-times forward earnings and 17.5-times sales, those rich multiples make sense for this top dog in the data-driven digital ad targeting realm. I believe competitive solid advantages, hard-to-replicate proprietary data and algorithms, and a massive market opportunity support an elevated premium.\n\nSure, there could be some speed bumps or growth deceleration at some point. But overall, I see The Trade Desk winning big as advertisers rely more on data to unlock advertising profits.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeft for dead after years of stagnation, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has since transformed itself into an emerging data and AI giant poised for new glory days ahead. Having shed slower-growth legacy businesses to focus its resources on next-generation technologies, a refreshed IBM looks to be hitting its stride at just the right time.\n\nNotably, IBM stock has surged 35% over the past year compared to 19% gains for the S&P 500 index. The company\u2019s 2024 guidance calls for 4%-5% annual revenue growth alongside $12 billion in free cash flow generation. Indeed, these numbers highlight the new IBM built around high-growth opportunities like hybrid cloud, AI, and security appears to have turned the corner.\n\nPersonally, I believe IBM\u2019s investments in frontier technologies like quantum computing hold even greater long-term promise. IBM continues plowing billions into research and development in this space to pioneer real-world applications that are years ahead of rivals. Thus, with quantum computing poised to revolutionize the word, I think that once viable use cases emerge within this decade, we could see history-making breakthroughs sooner than most expect, boosting IBM stock in the process.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy If There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "The S&P 500's return to an all-time high confirms the market entered a bull market. With this recent realization, downturns are likely not on the minds of most investors at this moment.\n\nHowever, due to the cyclical state of markets, investors should expect another bear market at some point and have a plan to deal with that scenario. Fortunately, bear markets are a great time to buy high-quality stocks on sale, and when that time comes, investors should consider loading up on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). Here's why.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAdmittedly, Nvidia may not seem like much of a \"pullback stock.\" The stock has risen nearly sixfold since its October 2022 low, and at a forward P/E ratio of 32, it is not as pricey as investors might assume.\n\nStill, Nvidia also has a history of massive declines during bear markets. When it reached its October 2022 low, the stock had fallen by more than two-thirds from its previous all-time high in November 2021. Also, when the market turned bearish in late 2018, Nvidia lost more than half of its value in the last three months of that year.\n\nNonetheless, investors should also know that the gains following those declines more than made up for the bear market losses.\n\nToday, Nvidia's dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has buoyed the stock. This led to massive revenue growth for the company. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29. 2023), revenue of $39 billion surged 86% higher compared with the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nConsequently, net income reached more than $17 billion in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Nvidia earned only $3 billion during the same time frame in 2023. Between AI's rising popularity and Nvidia's history, any pullback will become a likely buying opportunity.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe internet fostered a lucrative digital advertising industry, and ad-related tools have become increasingly crucial amid that rise. To that end, The Trade Desk's ad tech platform has become a go-to for media buyers. Through the platform, agencies and advertisers can manage ad campaigns.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the same vein as Roku, it has developed a reputation for neutrality, which reduces the odds of biased ad spending that could become an issue with an ad giant such as Google parent Alphabet.\n\nAdmittedly, The Trade Desk stock is tied to the state of ad spending. The last downturn occurred in 2022, leading to a stock decline of as much as two-thirds.\n\nDespite that sell-off, the Trade Desk is doing what it needs to keep such declines temporary. This is because the business continued to grow even as the stock experienced a bear market sell-off.\n\nDuring the 2022 downturn, revenue increased 32% yearly. Also, the $1.3 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 rose by 23%. Nonetheless, it turned profitable during that time, reporting $82 million in net income in the first nine months of 2023, up from an $18 million loss during the same timeframe in 2022.\n\nDue to the improved profitability, the Trade Desk sells for about 49 times forward earnings. Whether the stock goes up or down, profits are likely to see rapid improvement, making The Trade Desk stock a buy on just about any pullback.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is a strong sell-off stock because the company has learned to prosper in an often hostile environment. This region often contends with government bureaucracy, political turmoil, and high inflation.\n\nYet MercadoLibre thrives because of these challenges. It supports e-commerce, giving merchants an additional sales outlet.\n\nMoreover, to reach more of Latin America's cash-based customers, it started Mercado Pago, which can facilitate e-commerce transactions for those who lack access to the traditional banking system.\n\nAlso, Mercado Envios handles fulfillment and logistics. The company introduced one- and two-day shipping to markets where it had not been previously available.\n\nSuch businesses are recession-resistant. Thus, it should surprise few that businesses brought in $10.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, a 36% increase year over year. Interestingly, that represents a slowdown from 2022's 48% revenue growth rate, a time when the stock suffered through a bear market.\n\nNonetheless, MercadoLibre generated a net income of $822 million during that period, up from $317 million in the first three quarters of 2022. Furthermore, its revenue growth continued during the 2022 bear market, even as the stock sold off at the time.\n\nNot surprisingly, MercadoLibre's stock eventually recovered, rising by just under 50% over the last year. Despite that gain, it sells for 52 times forward earnings. With its rapid revenue growth in good times and bad, investors can safely buy the stock at this level.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Bargain Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "The stock market had a great year in 2023, largely bringing it back from the inflation-flavored plunge of 2022. The market barometer S&P 500 rose by 24.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index jumped 43.4%. The Federal Reserve's anti-inflation measures brought price growth back down, and the tech sector celebrated the arrival of powerful new artificial intelligence (AI) systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nBut some top-notch stocks weren't invited to last year's Wall Street party. At the start of February 2024, you'll still find some great investments biding their time in the bargain bin.\n\nThe signs of better days ahead are already piling up, as the looming recession threats of yesteryear recede and a new bull market has become official. For investors, it's high time to take action before the ongoing bull run really takes off.\n\nMy list of bargain stocks ready to soar in 2024 includes SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD). If you don't already own shares of these innovators, you might want to open a position while the shares are cheap. And if you already do, this could be a great time to double down on them.\n\n1. SoundHound AI\n\nAt its core, SoundHound AI specializes in developing cutting-edge voice recognition and natural language understanding technologies. You may know the company for its namesake app that can identify songs within earshot of your smartphone. These days, the AI-based technology that underlies that app has evolved into a full-fledged voice control platform for cars, drive-through windows, phone menus, and more. SoundHound AI's innovative solutions are designed to transform how businesses and consumers interact with devices and services using voice.\n\nYou'd think any company with \"AI\" in its name would have caught last year's artificial intelligence fever in a big way. 2023 sure started out that way and the stock more than doubled year-to-date on a couple of occasions.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut its rally lost momentum over the summer as a sluggish market recovery from the inflation crisis hammered unprofitable growth stocks. SoundHound AI closed the year with a 19.8% gain, underperforming the major market indices.\n\nThe market may have treated SoundHound AI like a red-headed stepchild in 2023, but the company's business is booming.\n\nTrailing revenues have roughly doubled over the last five quarters. Product royalties are soaring as the company adds more household-name businesses to its client list. On the bottom line, it's moving closer to the breakeven point quarter by quarter. As sales rise, profit margins benefit from economies of scale, an effective cost-cutting effort, and more efficient use of data center assets. SoundHound AI launched a full-service voice assistant system for restaurants in November. Early partners -- and cross-selling opportunities -- include sector giant Block and up-and-comer Toast. Three weeks later, the company acquired SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions to boost the new product and add more than 10,000 established SYNQ3 clients to its customer list.\n\nI can't wait to see the difference the restaurant service platform can make to SoundHound AI's financial results. This little company has big ambitions, and the bull market should light more fires under its growth engines.\n\nIn other words, you should take a look at this low-priced AI stock before it takes off.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nLet's talk about digital advertising services. The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) operates at the forefront of online marketing with a cutting-edge platform for highly automated ad-buying solutions.\n\nThe company stands head and shoulders above the competition thanks to 15 years of operating history, deep integration with many different ad-publishing channels, and an unmatched treasure trove of media-consumer data. In addition to these competitive advantages, The Trade Desk created an open-source user tracking technology known as Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) that helps advertisers track and evaluate their marketing efforts while maintaining the privacy of individual ad viewers.\n\nDigital marketing is luring ad dollars from more traditional channels like TV and radio ad spots, billboards, and newspaper blurbs. Targeted ads backed by The Trade Desk's data collection and analysis tools are simply more effective than spreading the same message across a wide area and hoping for the best.\n\nWhen The Trade Desk does its job right, ad-buying clients reap greater consumer interest, click-through rates, and sales from their marketing budgets. This business method results in some mind-boggling advantages for The Trade Desk itself.\n\nWhen times are hard and consumers hold on to their money with an iron-fisted grip, companies don't want to spend a lot on advertising. Why launch a lavish ad campaign when nobody is ready to buy stuff, right? However, it stands to reason that The Trade Desk's business will continue to grow under these circumstances since the company is all about juicing the effect of its clients' ad budgets.\n\nIndeed, that's how the high inflation and rising interest rate environment worked out for The Trade Desk -- looking at its three-year revenue chart, can you even tell where the digital ad industry's widely reported downturn fell? TTD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCEO Jeff Green highlighted how his company is taking market share these days, not only from old-school marketing solutions but also from other digital marketing specialists.\n\n\"Magna Global estimates that the overall U.S. advertising industry is growing at 5% this year, and digital spend or the digital ad market pie is expected to grow by 10%,\" Green said on November's third-quarter earnings call. \"Clearly, we are significantly outperforming the rest of the advertising market. This builds on our market share gains from last year when we grew 20%-plus each quarter and our competitors were posting negative to low single-digit growth.\"\n\nAnd here's the best part. The clients who got used to working with The Trade Desk during the lean years are likely to stay aboard when larger advertising budgets make sense again. Why switch back to a less effective ad-buying process after getting used to a better one?\n\nSo The Trade Desk thrives in challenging markets, then builds on those habit-changing periods with accelerated business growth when the sun shines again. The company's growth prospects are particularly impressive right now, as the world is swinging back into ad-buying after a long downturn, and UID2 is ready to take over as leading browsers turn off the old tracking solution known as third-party cookies.\n\nYet The Trade Desk's stock caught a milder version of SoundHound AI's market risk fever last year. The stock currently trades 25% below the 12-month high it reached last summer.\n\nThe time to buy The Trade Desk stock is now, in my humble opinion. I can't promise that the fourth-quarter report it's delivering in two weeks will show a complete return to free-spending form by ad buyers, but another robust report with good-looking guidance for the next period could be enough to relieve the price pressure that has been holding this stock down recently.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and The Trade Desk wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investors can accumulate stocks and generate long-term returns with a buy-and-hold strategy. While growth stocks can deliver exceptional gains over vast time horizons, some investors want gains sooner.\n\nHence, seeing a positive return within a few weeks can fuel motivation and result in higher portfolio contributions in the future. However, returns became less certain as the time horizon got shorter. Long-term investors stretch their time horizons across multiple years so a company\u2019s growth initiatives can play out.\n\nTherefore, while each of these stocks offers compelling long-term potential, it\u2019s possible that these stocks will deliver solid returns before Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been rallying in recent months. Shares are up by 20% over the past six months, and that rally is part of a 59% surge over the past year.\n\nFurther, AMZN enjoys several high-growth business segments. Cloud computing, e-commerce, and online advertising are some of the company\u2019s top revenue streams. Also, the company is jumping into artificial intelligence (AI) and working on its own AI chips to generate additional revenue. Already, Amazon has several large corporations as customers for its chips. Amazon refers to these chips as Amazon Bedrock.\n\nAMZN\u2019s efforts paid off in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023\u00a0as net sales increased by 13% year over year (YOY). Additionally, advertising revenue grew robustly in that quarter. The advertising industry exhibits high profit margins which can strengthen Amazon\u2019s margins in the future.\n\nFinally, Amazon\u2019s Prime Day was once again its largest ever. Demand for the company\u2019s online marketplace remains strong and can help the company invest in other ventures. While the company looks promising in the long run, the firm reports earnings on February 1st. Good earnings can drive the stock price higher before Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nStory continues\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (DRCT) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:DRCT) is a micro-cap advertising company valued at under $200 million. The company has a 15-forward P/E ratio and is growing its revenue and earnings at exceptional rates.\n\nAlso, Direct Digital Holdings achieved 129% YOY revenue growth in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023. Revenue growth throughout the year will double if the company achieves the midpoint of its Full-Year 2023 Revenue Guidance.\n\nMost of DRCT\u2019s revenue and high growth comes from its sell-side platform, Colossus. The segment\u2019s revenue grew by 174% YOY. And, net income surged from $0.8 million in the same period of 2022 to $3.4 million. Higher net income growth will result in a lower P/E ratio that can help the stock march higher.\n\nThe company finds itself at the center of a shift in ad spend as more businesses look toward digital media for visibility. While the sell-side advertising segment is the main revenue driver, DRCT\u2019s buy-side advertising also achieved double-digit YOY revenue growth.\n\nAdditionally, Direct Digital Holdings achieved triple-digit YOY revenue growth in\u00a0Q3 2022\u00a0compared to 2021. High growth seems like it will stick around for a few years.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Direct Digital Holdings is a small player in programmatic advertising,\u00a0The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) is the leader. Shares have gained 38% over the past year and are up by 368% over the past five years.\n\nTTD has been a consistent winner due to its revenue and earnings growth. Both numbers remain high and indicate The Trade Desk is gaining market share among the advertising giants.\n\nRevenue increased by 25% YOY in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023. The company\u2019s net income more than doubled, going up from $16 million in Q3 2022 to $39 million in Q3 2023. Expanding profit margins and solid top-line growth suggest The Trade Desk can continue to rally.\n\nCustomers have been enjoying the company\u2019s results. The firm has a 95% retention rate in the third quarter, maintaining that same rate for the past nine consecutive years.\n\nThe Trade Desk reports earnings on February 15th. Although that\u2019s after Valentine\u2019s Day, a rally leading into earnings can produce a solid gain. TTD looks like an enticing long-term stock that can benefit from some momentum leading up to Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in DRCT.

        "title": "12 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of AI, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, the rapid rise in prominence of the technology is quite striking. If we rewind the hands of time to mid 2022, then few people would be regularly talking about the technology, and media coverage would be limited to a handful of players such as the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. Yet, in just a year, AI is at the forefront of the media, investor, and even government attention as the advances in decision making offered by data science enable organizations to upscale their operations.\n\nSince it led the stock market to rise in 2023, AI is naturally at the front of attention in 2024 as well. The first two months of a year are particularly important for markets as they provide them with the perfect data to set the tone for the rest of the year. These come in the form of earnings reports, and for the Q1 2024 earnings season, all that anyone can talk about is AI. The year started off with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) assuring investors during its earnings call that it was in a stable position to capture any growth in the demand for AI chips. Its CEO C.C.\u00a0 Wei shared that TSMC is working with all the major players in the global A.I. industry, as he shared:\n\nThe surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and influence is increasing. As a result, AI model need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI.\n\nTo address unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. There is almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter TSMC, it was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s turn. The world's largest chip designer and manufacturer, Intel has struggled to keep up the pace with the industry's upgrade cycles and is now aggressively targeting rapid iteration and mass production of advanced semiconductor fabrication process node technologies. Leading the charge is Intel's CEO Patrick Gelsinger, who highlighted that not only can AI become an industry that drives a \"$1 trillion semiconductor TAM [TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET] by 2030,\" but also confidently asserted that \"given our foundry and product offerings, we're the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.\"\n\nShifting from the hardware side of the AI industry to the software, the next duo up on the earnings stage came in the form of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). As rapidly changing as AI is, if there's one thing that can be said with certainty about the software segment of artificial intelligence companies and stocks, it's that Alphabet and Microsoft sit right at the top of the global AI food chain that some estimates say has as many as 57,000 companies. Of course, the definition of an 'AI company' depends on whether you also include companies that use AI for their business processes as well as counting others who make the hardware and software. Yet, even if we include the former bunch, Alphabet and Microsoft are still likely to come out on top since their deep expertise in all things data science naturally provides them with a competitive advantage.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai led with AI and aimed right for the money when he explained during the firm's earnings call for the fourth quarter that it is heavily invested in improving Search results with AI. These announcements came even as Google's advertisement revenue failed to impress investors and led to a post earnings share price drop. Like Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella also talked about AI as he shared that the company had evolved from \"talking about AI\" to \"applying AI to scale.\"\n\nSo, as AI continues to remain the topic in technology and finance, we decided to see what AI stocks analysts believe are worth watching out for. Some top picks are The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD), Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), and Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP). 12 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nalex-knight-2EJCSULRwC8-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best artificial intelligence or AI stocks to buy according to analysts, we used the holdings of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF and ranked the firms by their average analyst share price target upside.

        "title": "The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 70% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Trade Desk's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Ownership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Trade Desk, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Trade Desk  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Trade Desk?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nTrade Desk already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Trade Desk's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Trade Desk. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Baillie Gifford & Co. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.3% and 4.8% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Jeffrey Green directly holds 3.0% of the total shares outstanding.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Trade Desk\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nShareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in The Trade Desk, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$1.2b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Trade Desk. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.
