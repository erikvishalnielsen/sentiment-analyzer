That narrowly surpassed Morgan Stanley\u2019s market value of $168.6 billion after four years of lagging the competitor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Could Be a Great Choice",
        "content": "Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 11.73% since the start of the year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.85 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.26%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.83% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.58%.\n\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 28.06%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Morgan Stanley's payout ratio is 54%, which means it paid out 54% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nMS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $7 per share, with earnings expected to increase 28.21% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's what top leaders are telling us about the state of the world and stocks",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nBeing a top-tier journalist isn't for everyone.\n\nI was reminded of this while chatting with seven-time Gerald Loeb award winner (the highest honor bestowed upon a business journalist), Allan Sloan, on my Opening Bid podcast this week. Sloan \u2014 who has been doing this crazy gig for more than 50 years \u2014 was recalling intense phone chats he had with then-NYC real estate developer Donald J. Trump.\n\nOther tales he spun include tough questions he posed to bombastic CEOs, and digging into companies to reveal a true picture for investors.\n\nListening to Sloan reaffirmed to me why (or partly why) I approach everything I do in this field with a sense it may all be taken away tomorrow. At the same time, the conversation was another proof point that if you want to excel, you have to do it way better than your competitor sitting at a similar desk across town or across the country.\n\nAnd if you can make that extra phone call at midnight to a source, send that one key email at 3 a.m., or take one more meeting at a bar after a long day, it can pay dividends in big ways.\n\nThese behind-the-scenes efforts tend to pay off in key moments in the business cycle or markets. Take, for example, this earnings season, where I've been chatting with leaders of public companies and top investing minds at the big banks.\n\nThe chats this go around have a different vibe to them, months removed from Election Day.\n\nIn the case of some, we are discussing the state of a consumer that has been less confident. In others, we are getting right into concerns about the run-up to the election and what policies may shape profits in 2025 and beyond.\n\nHere's what I am hearing, obtained simply by talking to a lot of people \u2014 just like an OG journalist such as Mr. Sloan has done for years.\n\nOtis CEO Judy Marks\n\nElevator maker Otis (OTIS) didn't have a blowout quarter this week. Instead, the company issued a warning on China demand.\n\nMarks \u2014 who also sits on the board of dump truck maker Caterpillar (CAT) \u2014 offered up observations on potential new tariffs, which Trump has floated. Our full interview can be seen in the above video.\n\n\"I think tariffs impact the American economy. They impact the American citizen no matter what they buy. We've seen that since tariffs have continued to go up regardless of which party wins. We need a pro-growth environment that allows us businesses that are multinational businesses to operate in a high-quality trade environment that everyone understands.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo that we can compete and when we can compete overseas, it drives additional economic growth and jobs here in the US, and that goes across all industries. A trade war, a tariff war, is not in the American economy's best interests, nor in our citizens' best interest.\"\n\nWhirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer\n\nAppliance giant Whirlpool (WHR) also had a tough quarter, fueled by softness in the US housing market. In talking to Bitzer, I didn't get the sense the company's US business would inflect this year even if the Fed cuts interest rates in the fall.\n\nNote that Bitzer declined to comment on whether European industrial behemoth Bosch has expressed interest in buying the company, as has been recently reported.\n\n\"As we internally talk about, interest rates don't change demographic trends or the age of the housing stock. The age of the housing stock is the highest it's been in my history.\n\nDemographic trends are strong. It's the interest rates, mortgage rates, and this famous lock in effect which many consumers experience, which holds everything back. I would, however, be cautious. One interest rate reduction won't unfreeze the market. I think it will take several moves. I would expect that probably you need mortgage rates to be in the five-something range to really see some momentum building.\"\n\nGeneral Motors CFO Paul Jacobson\n\nUnlike the two names mentioned above, General Motors (GM) did have a very solid quarter \u2014 markedly better, I would argue, than Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA).\n\nNo doubt EVs have become politicized this presidential election cycle. Jacobson told me the company is trying to \"rise above\" the political theater.\n\nHe did acknowledge, though, that GM has benefited from the Biden administration's efforts to promote EVs in the country, from building out the charging network to offering a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers. How that shifts under a potential Trump-led White House is unknown.\n\n\"I think we've obviously benefited from some of the jobs incentives and industry creation, but we've created thousands of jobs at our battery cell plants, module assembly, etc. And these are good, strong union jobs by American workers. So we're going to continue to invest. We're in this for the long term because, as we see it, it's about consumer choice.\"\n\nAmerican Express CEO Stephen Squeri\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) continues to feel the tailwind of younger consumers paying up to be cardholders, in part as it adds more perks (such as these new ones, reported by Yahoo Finance's personal finance team).\n\nThat appeared to be enough for Amex to hike its full-year guidance, despite signs of a more cautious consumer. The company is also lifting its full-year marketing budget by a whopping $800 million.\n\nI asked Squeri if he was more cautious on the second half of the year:\n\n\"If I was baking in more caution I wouldn't have raised the guidance. I wouldn't be increasing the marketing and so forth. I think that the key point here is the Fed will do what the Fed is going to do probably in September. They are certainly not going to raise rates, they'll probably be cut, they'll probably be another cut before the end of the year. I think that'll help consumer confidence. I think we'll see whatever happens in the election in November, which I don't think anybody has any idea and the reality is, this company has been around 174 years with 30 presidents \u2014 we'll get through whatever is we need to get through.\"\n\nChipotle CFO Jack Hartung\n\nHartung will be retiring soon from Chipotle (CMG) after a successful 23-year run as CFO. Very few have done it better.\n\nBut before he exits, Hartung did highlight a few challenges on his earnings call this week. One that stood out to me was resistance to higher prices in California after the state raised its minimum wage for food workers.\n\nI'm not used to Chipotle calling out price resistance.\n\nHere's what Hartung told me:\n\n\"We did have to increase prices between 6.5% to 7% when we raised wages almost 20%. And what we've seen is not so much resistance. So it's not because the Chipotle burrito costs a little more. There's really reduced spending across the restaurant industry. And when we've looked at it, restaurant companies that took a very high increase [in California] had an impact on sales, about the same as what we've seen. Restaurants that have taken no increase had the same kind of reduction in sales.\n\nSo it's really because everything is more expensive. The customer has pulled back on dining out pretty much across the board.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson\n\nWilson lead a large team at Morgan Stanley (MS), and speaks to some of the most influential investors in the world. He's one of the most widely followed strategists on Wall Street, amid years of on-the-mark calls (such as his 2022 bear market prediction).\n\nWith tech stocks coming under fresh pressure this week, what Wilson told me on Opening Bid regarding AI stock valuations was intriguing:\n\n\"AI is sucking all of the oxygen out of the room. But now I think we are entering that dangerous part of the story where we need to see it in the numbers. I see AI everywhere, except in the numbers. Outside of a few companies where it's obviously been dramatic, it hasn't really driven revenues and earnings anywhere.\"\n\nMore on the AI trade here.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. are turning rate-cut fever to their advantage by selling investors preferred shares with the heaviest dose of rate risk in years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on Harris Paris Sticks to Olympics Opening Event Plans After Rail Sabotage Fed\u2019s Favored Price Gauge Rises at Mild Pace, Spending Holds Up Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her Great Rotation Trade Sees Investors Dump AI Giants for Less Obvious Stocks\n\nThe Wall Street banks are reviving dormant formats to raise capital with a lot more duration than usual, playing into bets that the Federal Reserve is on the cusp of an easing cycle.\n\nIn one of the most striking examples, Morgan Stanley this week sold preferred shares with a fixed-for-life rate rare for a major bank, a feature that makes the security vulnerable to rate gyrations indefinitely. The same day a deal from Citigroup foisted rate risk on investors for a decade.\n\nSpeculation that the Fed may end up cutting interest rates faster or deeper than planned has led investors to bet on duration-heavy assets that typically notch price gains when rates are falling, and it\u2019s paving the way for deals that all but vanished in recent years.\n\n\u201cIssuers are taking advantage of the demand,\u201d said Mark Lieb, founder and CEO of Spectrum Asset Management.\n\nFor investors, the bet has delivered early gains. Morgan Stanley\u2019s issue is trading at an indicated price of 103% of face value; Citigroup\u2019s is close to 101%. Both were issued at par on Tuesday.\n\nBut down the road, investors accepting extra duration risk could face losses under US policies that may fan inflation. Preferred shares are subordinated securities that count toward a bank\u2019s regulatory capital.\n\nBloomberg contacted Morgan Stanley for comment, while a representative for Citigroup declined to comment.\n\nBanks are bringing back duration risk to preferred shares as conviction runs high the Fed will unleash its first quarter-point cut in September. A second cut is expected by the end of the year, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Two months ago, money-market odds pointed to single cut this year.\n\nEven though they are perpetual, issues from big banks nowadays tend to reset to a floating rate after their first optional repayment date, making their prices much less sensitive to moving interest rates. And the time to the first call date is usually only five years, limiting volatility.\n\nWhile short term rates are set to be pushed down by Fed cuts, long term rates aren\u2019t expected to follow suit. Traders betting on the return of Donald Trump as US president next year expect his policies to drive up inflation, which would force up yields on longer-dated instruments. This widening gap between short and long-term rates, a key part of the so-called \u201cTrump trade,\u201d is called steepening.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cA Trump election win may steepen the yield curve which may lead to higher long-term rates,\u201d said Arnold Kakuda, senior financials credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIf more banks believe that happens, they may want to issue more longer duration fixed for life.\u201d\n\nA chaotic US election, including the assassination attempt on Trump, and potential for more market volatility is one reason why Spectrum\u2019s Lieb said he passed on both the Morgan Stanley and Citigroup sales.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much uncertainly,\u201d said Lieb. \u201cWe still think it\u2019s safer to have shorter duration.\u201d\n\nBrian McArdle, portfolio analyst at GW&K Investment Management, is also leery of using preferred shares to make rate bets. \u201cWe always believe interest rates are very difficult to forecast,\u201d he said.\n\nCitigroup went for a 10-year fixed-rate period until the first call, a type of preferred stock that had become almost obsolete in recent years as five-year fixed-rate period dominated.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley sold a series packaged in a way that could be sold to retail clients, the first time this was done in almost two years by a Big Six lender. This is referred to as the $25 par market to differentiate it from the institutional investor-focused $1,000 segment.\n\nThe fixed-for-life rate has been deployed previously this year only by regional banks.\n\nMorgan Stanley originally guided for $250 million before setting the final size to $1 billion. That kind of demand may spur copycat deals.\n\n\u201cMost will probably stick to NC5, but to diversify, they may look at other ways,\u201d Kakuda said. \u201cThe door has been cracked open so why not?\u201d\n\n(Adds line in 7th paragraph to describe US policy risk)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners Joe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker The $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Disney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel The US Economy Is Slowing, Which Is Just Fine With the Fed\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

In addition, the financing also includes a $225 million revolving credit facility, which the company can choose to tap at will.\n\nMorgan Stanley, KKR\u2019s capital markets arm, and UBS Group AG are providing the bulk of the financing, the people added. Jefferies and Royal Bank of Canada are also participating.

Instructure had been working with an adviser after receiving takeover interest, Bloomberg News reported previously.\n\nLeveraged buyout activity is beginning to pick up, and the Instructure debt package is another win for the banks who regularly compete with private credit lenders to provide this type of financing.

        "content": "After Wednesday\u2019s painful market sell-off, investors seeking value and bountiful dividend stocks may have more of a chance to pounce. Indeed, the broader market indices are fresh off their worst day since 2022. At this juncture, it\u2019s okay to be slightly rattled as you look to reposition ahead of a choppy move into mid- and late-summer.\n\nUndoubtedly, some of the \u201csafest\u201d dividend value plays could not avoid damage from the violent mid-week reversal. And come to the next market-wide correction (the Nasdaq 100 is another ugly down day after one), investors should expect that only a few names will be spared from the carnage.\n\nThe following three dividend stocks may take less of a hit than the high-tech names, falling faster than the broader markets. Look at a trio of low-cost dividend stocks that finished Wednesday in the green.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) was up in the green by more than 5% as the rest of the market fell into a sea of red, thanks to a solid quarter that saw net phone subscribers rise ahead of expectations.\n\nUndoubtedly, T stock has been a long-time underperformer in the past decade, so any sudden bursts of brilliance will be a breath of fresh air for T shareholders. Investors should expect more market days like Wednesday, a day that saw the biggest winners become the losers and vice versa.\n\nIn any case, AT&T stock hasn\u2019t been a complete laggard, especially of late. Year to date, T stock is up more than 11%. That\u2019s still less than the S&P 500, even after the latest sell-off, but still remarkable for AT&T\u2019s standards, especially given how long it\u2019s been a perennial underperformer.\n\nWith a 10.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, a whopping 6.1% dividend yield and a 0.72 beta, AT&T could be a great hideout for investors who fear the market is turning.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) also had the rest of the market green with envy on Wednesday, as shares rose 4.6%. A solid second-quarter showing helped NEE stock buck the trend. As one of the most intriguing dividend-paying (2.9% yield at writing) green energy plays in the market, perhaps investors seeking relative stability should look to the name as it looks to sustain gains in the face of an ugly turn for markets.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Andrew Percoco pounded the table on NextEra stock and other renewable firms, noting that a \u201cfull-scale\u201d repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act was not likely even if Republicans were to win the White House and that \u201cdemand for renewables\u201d was likely to stay robust, regardless of who wins the election and what\u2019s to happen with renewable tax credits.\n\nStory continues\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. NextEra has what it takes to keep powering ahead over time, even if the next president isn\u2019t nearly as kind to the clean energy firms. Further, NextEra CEO John Ketchum sees renewable energy demand tripling in the next seven years as more data centers come online.\n\nSeagate Technology (STX) A Seagate Technology (STX) sign hanging above an office in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike the other two outperformers on this list, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) clocked in a solid quarter that helped it rise on one of the biggest down days for markets in recent memory. Undoubtedly, the data storage firm is a great value-conscious way to bet on the AI boom, which likely still has legs despite having the AI trade run into a brick wall on Wednesday.\n\nHats off to Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson, who hiked his STX stock price target to $130 from $100 ahead of the number. Bryson noted a \u201csignificant fundamental shift\u201d in the last quarter. Indeed, the shift carried over into Q2 in a big way, as Seagate\u2019s sales and margins improved on the back of recovering demand for storage products.\n\nAs the cyclical upswing continues, it\u2019s hard to justify taking profits in STX, especially as its HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) drive looks to pick up momentum in the second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Things are getting extremely volatile in the market. After big tech earnings disappointed, the Nasdaq index plunged more than 600 points (3.5%) in a single trading session as the rotation out of technology securities gathers steam. At the same time, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell more than 2% and posted its worst one-day performance since the 2022 bear market.\n\nWhile the current situation is worrisome, it could also create opportunities for investors to buy some great stocks on the cheap. Many value stocks that were out of favor with investors this year look even more attractively priced and valued amid the market selloff. Astute investors with long-time horizons can swoop in and buy great stocks while the share price is beaten down and eventually ride them higher once the market recovers.\n\nHere are three value stocks to buy on the dip: July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nSoft drink maker PepsiCo\u2019s (NASDAQ:PEP) stock is down 12% over the last year compared to a near 20% gain for the benchmark S&P 500 index. The company behind Pepsi and Mountain Dew has struggled with inflation, forcing it to raise prices and drive price-conscious consumers towards generic alternatives of its products, which also include Gatorade and Lay\u2019s potato chips.\n\nPepsiCo recently reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with its profit beating Wall Street forecasts but its revenue coming up short. The sales miss was reportedly because of the declining demand in North America. PepsiCo\u2019s prices rose an average of 5% during this year\u2019s second quarter. The company also continues to deal with fallout from product recalls at its Quaker Foods division, which makes oatmeal.\n\nDespite these near-term headwinds, PEP stock looks positioned for long-term success, especially with interest rates expected to decline this autumn and the Quaker Foods recall sliding into the rearview mirror.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) United Health Stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the biggest health insurer in the U.S., has seen its stock short-circuited by a cyberattack on its technology unit called \u201cChange Healthcare\u201d that occurred in February of this year. The attack on Change Healthcare disrupted UnitedHealth\u2019s payment system and forced it to provide $9 billion of loans to partners. It\u2019s also expected to cost the company $1.90 to $2.05 in earnings per share this year.\n\nOwing largely to the cyberattack, UNH stock is up 6% this year. While disappointing, there are signs that UnitedHealth Group is turning a corner. The company just reported Q2 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts. UnitedHealth reported EPS of $6.80, topping analyst estimates of $6.67. Revenue during the quarter totaled $98.86 billion, which was slightly ahead of forecasts that called for $98.72 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement said the worst is likely over for the company concerning the cyberattack earlier this year. That makes UnitedHealth Group a value stock worth buying on the dip.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong banks, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) looks like a good buy-the-dip candidate. The Wall Street investment firm has been the laggard among major financial institutions over the last 12 months. Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock is up only 10% during the past year, while archrival Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock has gained 36% in the same period of time. Several other banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), were also up more than 30% since this time last year.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s stock also looks fairly valued trading at 15 times future earnings estimates and offering a quarterly dividend payment of 92 cents a share, giving it a yield of 3.63%. Now would be an opportune time to take a position, with Morgan Stanley\u2019s business firing on all cylinders. With its Q2 print, the investment bank reported a big rebound in its deal-making activity, stock trading and in its lucrative wealth management unit. Its investment banking revenues surged 51% year-over-year, crushing estimates.\n\nMorgan Stanley also has a new CEO in Ted Pick, who took the helm of the bank at the start of this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Overlooked Bank Stocks to Buy With Lower Interest Rates in 2025",
        "content": "As we speed through the second half of 2024, bank stocks remain an attractive opportunity for discerning investors. The banking industry is one of the more appealing sectors, given that tech stock valuations are at unsustainable levels.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is largely anticipated to cut interest rates going into 2025, which could be a positive backdrop for some of the companies listed below. Cheaper borrowing costs can fuel growth and investments for businesses, which can stimulate economic growth. Additionally, this could resolve issues with the tight labor market and the current supply and demand imbalances.\n\nAlthough this might translate to lower net interest income on deposits, the bank\u2019s liquidity is extremely strong. Other divisions, including wealth and asset management, also appear to be taking off. These developments will ensure that banks are well-diversified and ready to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top three bank stocks to buy with lower interest rates in 2025!\n\nM&T Bank (MTB) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for M&T Bank Corp (MTB).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nM&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is among the top overlooked bank stocks to buy in July 2024. It primarily operates across the eastern United States and possesses strong fundamentals and robust growth potential.\n\nSome of the key strengths of M&T, as compared to its peers, are the company\u2019s strong credit quality and healthy balance sheet. Its growing revenue, earnings and EBITDA also continue to show notable improvements. Luckily, it was able to avoid the pitfalls of the regional banking crisis in 2023 and continued to thrive. Moreover, it has embraced digital transformation, leading to extremely high customer satisfaction in the mobile banking arena. In FY23, the company reported record net interest income of $7.11 billion. Its full-year earnings per share increased 37% year-over-year (YOY) to $15.79 per share, with average commercial loans, consumer loans and deposits up substantially. With M&T entering 2024 with stronger credit quality, capital and reserves, it will thrive regardless of the interest rate environment.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another banking giant that investors should keep a close eye on in the second half of 2024. While it is primarily known for its investment banking prowess, it continues to diversify its areas like consumer banking, which could prove to be a great long-term bet.\n\nGoldman Sach is ultimately known for its investment banking division. However, the company recently made strategic moves to bolster its consumer banking and wealth management divisions. Its Marcus Brand, which offers high-yield savings, high-yield CDs and credit cards, continues to gain traction. The segment is extremely promising, given the strong growth of the retail banking sector. Additionally, its investment banking division is booming, driven by the rebound in equity and debt underwriting.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q2 FY24, revenue increased 17% YOY to $12.73 billion. Net earnings skyrocketed 150% to $3.04 billion, with investment banking fees up 21% from the year prior. This performance after a strong first quarter makes GS stock one of the best overlooked bank stocks to buy going into 2025.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is the final overlooked bank stock on the list to snap up with interest rates on track to move lower. As a rival to investment banking giant, Goldman Sachs, the company has also enjoyed a favorable rebound in deal flow in 2024.\n\nMorgan Stanley is undergoing a turnaround in its business. After going through a slump for the past two years, things are finally starting to look positive. The broader business community is becoming more optimistic, translating to robust growth in its investment banking and investment management divisions. In addition, lower interest rates could also be a strong signal that this growth is just beginning. After topping its financial expectations in the first quarter, the firm delivered notable strength in investment banking, fixed-income securities and investment management.\n\nIn the second quarter, revenue increased 12% YOY to $15 billion. Net earnings rose 41% YOY to $3.08 billion, with investment banking revenues up 50% from the year prior. As capital market conditions improve, MS remains well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Predicts Triple-Digit Rally for These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Wall Street likes to peer into the fog of the future and guess where a stock is headed. While these stock price predictions are based on educated estimates, often based on information and models unavailable to regular investors, they are nonetheless guesses.\n\nAnalyst price targets are short-term in nature. They tend to look out for 12 months or so. Investors shouldn\u2019t weigh too much on these opinions as stock prices can be volatile over such short periods. An investor should seek to own a stock for at least three to five years, preferably a decade or longer.\n\nStill, when analysts peg high-growth stocks to double or more in a year, it is worth noting. After all, even if they are wrong by half, it could amount to some serious gains. But that also means if you have chosen a stock because you think it has long-term potential, I wouldn\u2019t sell it just because it reached an analyst\u2019s arbitrary price target. Letting your winners run is solid investment advice that has proven its worth over time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three high-growth stocks Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts see growing by 100% over the next year. Let\u2019s see if these are grounded expectations or just wishcasting.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese electric vehicle manufacturer Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is the first high-growth stock that more than one analyst sees doubling in value. Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao has a market-high target price of $53 per share despite his lower outlook of $65 per share.\n\nLI stock is down 47% in 2024 as the slowing EV market even hit China\u2019s automakers. Yet June deliveries across the industry surprised the market with its strength. Second quarter numbers were much more robust than anticipated.\n\nThe EV maker delivered 47,774 vehicles in June, up 47% from last year and slightly ahead of expectations for 47,000. Li also reported selling 108,600 EVs in the second quarter, better than the midpoint of the range it provided in May of 105,000 to 110,000 vehicles. With Li expected to report its financials in late August, Hsiao said he cut his price target to reflect \u201cLi Auto\u2019s strategic product pipeline changes.\u201d\n\nThat is based on Li\u2019s decision to delay releasing a pure electric SUV this year. The automaker has pushed back the timeline to the first half of 2025.\n\nStill, Hsiao believes the selloff in LI stock was overdone. So, although he lowered his price target, it still implies a 168% upside potential in the stock.\n\nSilence Therapeutics (SLN) Hand pointing up and to the right with blue arrow, symbolizes growth stocks. hypergrowth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nStory continues\n\nBritish biotech Silence Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SLN) is the second high-growth stock with triple-digit percentage return potential. Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Ulz has an overweight rating on the stock and raised his price target last month from $45 per share to $49, implying a 129% upside. Yet that is somewhat below the consensus outlook on the stock, with a price target of $61.50 per share or 186% above current levels.\n\nSilence wants to use precision-engineered medicines using RNA interference (RNAi). It is the body\u2019s natural mechanism of \u201csilencing\u201d the expression of genes that cause disease. Its lead drug candidate is zerlasiran (SLN360), currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. Silence recently reported positive results from a 48-week study of 178 patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), which indicates a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It said Zerlasiran was well tolerated and had no serious safety concerns.\n\nBiotech\u2019s stock has been up 23% this year but has tripled over the last 12 months. In February, it received a $10 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), which is collaborating on various cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases. As part of the collaboration, it can pursue 10 targets. Silence is eligible for up to $140 million in development milestones and up to $250 million in commercialization milestones. It will also receive tiered royalties on net sales when they occur.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around it\n\nSource: ra2 studio/Shutterstock\n\nAnother biotech with high-growth potential is Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX). It is making a name for itself in the obesity drug market, which was popularized by Ozempic and Wegovy from Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Monjouro and Zepbound from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).\n\nViking seeks to stake out a new path by making a therapy in pill form. Because the competition requires regular injections, pills are a less optimal treatment for diabetes and obesity. Weight loss in a pill is something of the Holy Grail in public acceptance, and Viking\u2019s GLP-1 treat called VK2735 could open it to a massive opportunity.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Ulz also covers Viking, and he set a $105 per share price target for biotech. That suggests a 121% upside for VKTX stock.\n\nShares are down 47% from the highs they hit on early positive results from VK2735, but they remain 182% higher in 2024 and are more than 240% above where the stock stood a year ago.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "America\u2019s big banks have reported their second-quarter financial results, and, with a few exceptions, they were extremely strong. Both commercial lenders and investment banks on Wall Street saw their revenues and profits get a lift in Q2 due to a resumption of deal making that includes initial public offerings as well as mergers and acquisitions. Trading activity also surged on Wall Street with markets near record highs.\n\nThe strong Q2 results cap recent good news for the banks. In June, the major lenders successfully passed the annual stress test administered by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Passing that test cleared the way for the banks to raise their dividend payments to shareholders and announce new stock buyback programs, which nearly all of them have done.\n\nWith their share prices marching higher, we look at three bank stocks to buy after earnings in the second quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reported a 41% surge in its Q2 profit due to a rebound in investment banking activity. The Wall Street firm reported earnings per share of $1.82, compared to $1.65, which had been the consensus forecast of analysts. Revenue in the April through June quarter totaled $15.02 billion, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $14.3 billion. Revenue was up 12% from a year earlier.\n\nBeyond investment banking, Morgan Stanley announced strong trading activity and growth in its wealth management unit during the quarter. The bank said its stock trading revenue grew 18% while sales from fixed-income trading increased 16%. Still, investment banking was real standout, where revenues surged 51% to $1.62 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $220 million. MS stock has gained 10% over the last 12 months and looks to have momentum.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) remains the largest bank in the world with $3.4 trillion of assets under management. The lender also reported stellar Q2 financial results driven by a 50% increase in fees earned from its investment banking activities. JPMorgan reported EPS of $4.40, which was ahead of the $4.19 expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $50.99 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.87 billion.\n\nLike Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase attributed the strong results to a rebound in investment banking activity. JPMorgan also benefited from strong stock trading activity during the quarter, with markets at a record high. Other reasons to like JPMorgan stock are its quarterly dividend payment, which the bank just raised to $1.25 a share from $1.15, along with a new $30 billion share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPM stock is up 34% over the last 12 months and trading near an all-time high.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another leading investment bank that reported strong Q2 results that beat Wall Street estimates across the board. The firm announced EPS of $8.62 compared to $8.34 forecast among analysts. The company\u2019s profit was up an impressive 150% from a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter totaled $12.73 billion, beating consensus expectations of $12.46. Sales rose 17% from a year ago.\n\nManagement said the better-than-expected results were due to a rebound in fixed-income trading and strong results in its deal advisory and wealth management operations. Revenue from Goldman\u2019s fixed-income trading rose 17% from a year ago to $3.18 billion. Other highlights included equity trading, which gained 7%, and wealth management, which saw a 27% increase in revenue during the period.\n\nThe latest results mark a turnaround for Goldman Sachs following a dismal 2022 and 2023 when a bear market in stocks and deals dried up on Wall Street. GS stock has risen 36% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Dell Stock Buy Alert: A Double Play on AI and PC Market Recovery",
        "content": "There are many great reasons to buy Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) stock, especially with the share price having pulled back in recent months.\n\nDell stock has fallen nearly 30% since it hit a 52-week high at the end of May this year. The share price declined after the company\u2019s first-quarter financial results raised concerns about the profitability of Dell\u2019s servers that are used to run artificial intelligence (AI) applications and models. Those concerns overshadowed what was otherwise a strong print from the company, which is benefitting not only from strong demand for its AI servers but also a global refresh cycle for its core personal computer (PC) business.\n\nDespite the pullback since May, Dell stock is still up 140% over the last 12 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPC Market Rebound\n\nIn June, market research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) forecast a rebound for the personal computer (PC) market excluding China. Worldwide sales this year are likely to number more than 260 million units, according to the forecast. The rebound in PC sales is being driven by a new crop of computers that can run AI software., as well as the replacement of hardware and equipment purchased at the outset of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nIDC said that AI-enabled PC\u2019s share of the overall market will grow from about 20% this year to more than two-thirds (67%) in 2028. The firm added that it expects AI PCs will boost average selling prices and give a financial lift to computer manufacturers such as Dell. Excluding China, IDC said that PC shipments this year should increase 2.6% from 2023 levels. The firm sees a further tailwind in the second half of 2025 as demand in China recovers.\n\nAI Demand\n\nThe rebound in global PC sales can only help give Dell Technologies\u2019 stock a boost, especially as the company has announced that it is going all-in on AI-enabled computers. While Dell\u2019s PC sales saw flat year-over-year growth in Q1 of this year, the company is forecasting a rebound in the second half. The company reports its Q2 earnings on August 29.\n\nThe company is also seeing huge demand for its AI servers. Dell said shipments of it\u2019s AI-optimized servers rose more than 100% sequentially to $1.70 billion in this year\u2019s first quarter. The company\u2019s backlog of orders for it\u2019s AI servers rose 30% during Q1 of this year to $3.80 billion. Dell has emerged as a leading vendor for AI servers, which are in high demand as companies invest in infrastructure to support generative AI applications. The company said AI server sales rose 42% to $5.50 billion in Q1 and that demand is strengthening.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpgrades and S&P 500 Inclusion\n\nIn late June, investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) named Dell stock a \u201ctop pick\u201d and said the company\u2019s share price could rise 40% from current levels. Morgan Stanley is pounding the table on Dell stock and encouraging investors to take advantage of the share\u2019s recent decline. Other analysts are also bullish on the stock and its prospects moving forward.\n\nCurrently, DELL stock has a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating among 12 Wall Street analysts, along with a median price target that is 23% higher than where the shares currently trade. Analysts see plenty of tailwinds gathering for the company and its stock. Another catalyst for Dell stock could come from it possibly being added to the S&P 500index later this year. Dell is currently the largest stock (with a market cap of $90 billion) that is not included in the benchmark index, and there are rumors it could be added in an upcoming rebalancing.\n\nBeing added to the S&P 500 would give Dell stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index would be required to buy shares.\n\nBuy Dell Stock\n\nThere are so many things working in Dell\u2019s favor right now, it seems like a no-brainer for investors to take a position. Moving forward, the company should benefit from both surging demand for its AI servers and a global PC refresh cycle. Analysts are extremely bullish on the stock. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index would give the share price a further boost. With so much momentum behind it, investors shouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy Dell stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Uses Capital Format Big Lenders Avoided for Years",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley is offering to sell a type of bank capital security that the country\u2019s biggest lenders neglected for almost two years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup A Six-Second Decision Shows How Harris Snapped Up Delegates Harris Has Enough Delegates to Clinch Nomination for President Wiz Rejects Google\u2019s $23 Billion Offer, Seeks IPO Instead Trump Floated Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary, Then Denies It\n\nThe bank is looking to raise $250 million through a perpetual preferred share issue on Tuesday that pays a fixed rate for life, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The prospective issue, which targets retail investors with its $25 dollar chunks, is callable after five years.\n\nThis type of note has been a rarity among the so-called Big Six in recent years, as big lenders focused more on preferred issues sold to institutional clients with more complicated pay structures. Retail investor-friendly preferreds gained prominence this year among regional lenders as a way to raise capital while giving small investors a way to profit when interest rates drop.\n\n\u201cThe fixed-for-life structure will benefit retail investors because they have no ability to hedge rates,\u201d said Spencer Phua, senior desk analyst at Piper Sandler Credit Trading, who flagged the potential for good price performance if rates come down.\n\nMorgan Stanley and other banks involved in the deal can rely on their strong retail networks, Phua said.\n\nMorgan Stanley didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nPreferreds with smaller denominations are traded on exchanges and often pay a fixed coupon until the bank decides to redeem it. Those with larger denominations change hands over-the-counter and pay an initial fixed rate until the first early redemption option, after which they switch to a floating rate, similar to the Additional Tier 1 bonds used to raise capital by banks in many other countries.\n\nJust over two months ago, Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank Corp. managed to score the same cost of capital as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. with a retail preferred issue. Back then, some investors raised questions about the amount of capital that could be raised with a $25-par preferred.\n\nPrior to Morgan Stanley\u2019s offering Tuesday, no bank among the Big Six \u2014 a group comprising Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. \u2014 had sold preferred stock in $25 increments in almost two years.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Citigroup tapped the market in an effort to raise at least $500 million with an institutional investor-focused note callable after 10 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Morgan Stanley (MS): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +5.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 1.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +18.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +28.2%. This estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.9%. The $58.62 billion and $61.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.3% and +4.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $15.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. EPS of $1.82 for the same period compares with $1.24 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.95%. The EPS surprise was +10.3%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.925 on 15th of August. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.6%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings\n\nWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Morgan Stanley's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. Since a dividend means the company is paying out cash to investors, this could prove to be a problem in the future.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 32.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 52% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward. historic-dividend\n\nMorgan Stanley Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.20 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.70. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 34% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.\n\nWe Could See Morgan Stanley's Dividend Growing\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Morgan Stanley has impressed us by growing EPS at 5.5% per year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Morgan Stanley will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Morgan Stanley that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

Per PR Newswire, Robert Half generated a net income of $64 million, or $0.61 per share, on revenues of $1.476 billion.\n\n\u201cFirst quarter results were largely in line with expectations, and we are encouraged that second-quarter earnings guidance, led by Protiviti, anticipates higher sequential earnings for the first time in seven quarters,\" said Keith Waddell, president and chief executive officer at Robert Half.\n\nTo summarize, Morgan Stanley, Trinity Industries, and Robert Half represent perfect choices for investors seeking reliable income and long-term stability.

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One Meme Stock in July, It Better Be One of These 3 Names",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has been making new all-time highs on seemingly a weekly basis. And while recent price action in the market has been relatively weak, optimism appears to remain plentiful. Various meme stocks have ridden this sentiment higher during certain bouts of euphoria this year. Yet, many of the top names in the more speculative corners of the market are down considerably from this year\u2019s peak.\n\nThe question is whether meme stocks as a whole can regain their luster, or if a select few will see the majority of the upside if this bull market continues. I think the latter scenario is much more likely, with most meme stocks not worth your time of day.\n\nFor investors looking for some high-profile meme stocks with an actual shot at providing meaningful gains, explore my top three picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has surged 69% so far in 2024 due to surging artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. Indeed, the public ultimately recognized that Palantir is a big data and AI company that\u2019s worth its high valuation.\n\nThe company has seen impressive growth in its commercial segment, which drove the majority of the company\u2019s revenue and earnings beat. Adoption for the company\u2019s AI products is picking up from various blue-chip clients, who appear to be well-positioned to remain customers for the long-term.\n\nAlso, the firm\u2019s core government business saw revenue grow 16%, with notable contracts like a $178 million deal secured with the U.S. Army. International government revenue increased by 33%, highlighting the company\u2019s global expansion, despite European challenges. Palantir Technologies is poised for market dominance by 2030.\n\nThe company\u2019s versatility, from optimizing hospital systems to developing Army technology, presents a vast market opportunity. This bodes well for long-term investors, suggesting substantial opportunities for long-term growth.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nAs the King of the AI chip sector, semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has surged more than 150% in 2024 alone. That return isn\u2019t surprising, considering Nvidia\u2019s GPUs power almost the entire AI ecosystem right now.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q2 earnings are going to be significant for investors in determining whether the recent high demand for its chips is sustainable. Market optimism about a Fed pivot could benefit Nvidia if businesses align with this view.\n\nDespite concerns about potential overvaluation and a correction, the company remains optimistic about its long-term performance. A key factor is its accelerated chip development, with Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang announcing annual AI chip launches instead of every two years. In the last quarter, Nvidia reported $26 billion in revenue, a 262% increase year-over-year (YOY), with a projected 2% rise next quarter. While trading at a premium, its growth potential justifies the current multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies across sectors are racing to develop AI applications, relying on Nvidia\u2019s hardware. Although valuations were high, Nvidia has consistently aced its revenue and earnings estimates, making the upcoming report crucial for analysts.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLastly, despite its tremendous downside seen over the past couple of months, EV king Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still a prominent artificial intelligence (AI) stock to consider. As of this writing, Tesla has revealed its Tesla bot, which they debuted in the 2024 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai. Analysts suggest this prototype could soon replace human labor in various industries.\n\nI\u2019ve been bearish on Tesla in the past, and am still broadly bearish on this company over the long-term. But I\u2019m not going to deny the fact that this is a company with a meme or cult following. CEO Elon Musk is among the most divisive figures in big tech, but he\u2019s someone investors continue to follow. So long as that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s hard to bet against this name if meme mania returns.\n\nDespite reporting an 8.7% revenue decline and a 55.1% drop in earnings, Tesla maintained a profit margin of 14.37% and an operating margin of 5.50%. Investors remained bullish, with TSLA stock now up over 50% in a month, driven by excitement over Robotaxi concepts. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised its price target on TSLA stock in part due to growth in the company\u2019s energy segment. It noted a record 9.4 GWh of energy storage deployed in Q2 of 2024, despite Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries miss.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

Remember, hydrogen \u2014 which only produces water vapor and warm air \u2014 is key to helping the U.S. achieve its net-zero emission goals.\n\nWhile we wait to see what happens, some CEOs, like Plug Power\u2019s (NASDAQ:PLUG) Andy Marsh, are confident the rules will be relaxed. And if that\u2019s the case, investors should start accumulating hydrogen stocks today to get a jump on a future rush.\n\nBloom Energy (BE)  BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE), I said, \u201cInvestors should use the latest pullback in BE shares as a buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nThat was on June 27, as Bloom Energy traded at about $13. Today, it\u2019s up to $15.28 and is still one of the top hydrogen stocks to buy and hold.\n\nHelping,\u00a0the company will deploy its fuel cells to generate on-site power for a high-performance artificial intelligence data center with CoreWeave.\n\nAs noted in the press release, \u201cThe modern data center will allow for high-density deployments with advanced cooling systems, allowing CoreWeave to offer performant and efficient cloud solutions for AI.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital also reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm highlighted the\u00a0potential for Bloom\u2019s fuel cell technology to meet the increasing energy demands of data center customers.\u00a0Analysts at BTIG also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $21.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn May 20, I mentioned Linde (NASDAQ:LIN), noting that at $432.42, it was a bargain.\n\nAt the time, LIN had fallen on earnings. Nowadays, it\u2019s up to $449.29, where it\u2019s still a strong buy. From here, I\u2019d like to see LIN initially retest prior resistance at $476.18. Plus, while we wait for that to happen, we can collect its current yield of about 1.24%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHelping, analysts at Citi (NYSE:C) just boosted their price target on Linde to $480 and Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) raised its price target on LIN to $512, with a Buy rating.\n\nIn addition,\u00a0as noted by\u00a0InvestorPlace contributor Terel Miles, \u201cLinde\u2019s established presence and technological capabilities will drive approximately 8-10% EPS growth in FY24. This makes LIN stock one of the top renewable energy stocks to snap up before the next leg higher.\u201d\n\nAir Products and Chemicals (APD) Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PA\n\nSource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com\n\nI also said weakness was an opportunity in Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) on July 3.

Bank of America also topped estimates with second-quarter revenue and profit that were fueled by rising investment banking and asset management fees.\n\nGoldman Sachs Justified The High Expectations\n\nOut of the six biggest banks, \u00a0Goldman is the most reliant on investment banking and trading to generate revenue and therefore, expectations were high with the rebound in Wall Street activity.\u00a0\u00a0For the quarter ended on June 30th,\u00a0revenue grew 17% to $12.73 billion on the back of core trading, advisory, as well as asset and wealth management operations, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s $12.46 billion estimate.\u00a0Prrofit surged 150%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$3.04 billion, or $8.62 per share; but last year\u2019s financials were dragged down by hamstrung by write-downs from commercial real estate and the sale of a consumer business.\n\nFixed income was one of the highlights with revenue jumping 17% to $3.18 billion, surassping StreetAccount\u2019s estimate by $220 million, along with the bank\u2019s shrinking exposure to consumer loans as provision for credit losses went down 54% to $282 million, which is quite below StreetAccount\u2019s estimate of $435.4 million.\u00a0On other fronts, Goldman Sachs was mainly in line with estimates. Equities trading rose 7% to $3.17 billion based on strong activity in derivatives.\n\nAsset and wealth management division reported growth of 27% as revenue amounted to $3.88 billion.\u00a0Platform solutions division reported revenue grew 2% to $669 million on the back of rising credit card balances and deposits.\n\nBut the well-known investment banking business disappointed compared to rivals as investment banking fees rose only 21% to $1.73 billion, slightly brlow StreetAccount\u2019s $1.8 billion estimate, with growth behind far behind rivals JPMOrgan Chase and Citigroup who have reported rises exceeding 50%. Goldman Sachs attributed the miss to\u00a0weaker-than-expected advisory fees of $688 million.\n\nMorgan Stanley Benefited From Rebounding Wall Street Activity\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, Morgan Stanley reported revenue grew\u00a012%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$15.02 billion, topping Wall Street\u2019s $14.3 billion estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nWealth management revenue grew 2% to $6.79 billion, which was short of $6.88 billion estimate. Equity trading reported growth of 18% as revenue amounted to $3.02 billion, surpassing the StreetAccount estimate by about $330 million. Fixed income trading revenue grew by 16% to $1.99 billion, topping the Wall Street estimate by $130 million.\u00a0Fueled by rising fixed income underwriting activity, investment banking revenue surged 51% to $1.62 billion, exceeding the estimate by $220 million.\n\nThe bottom line surged 41% YoY as profit amounted to $3.08 billion, or $1.82 per share, helped by a rebound in Wall Street activity..\n\nInterest income plunged 17% YoY to $1.79 billion as the rate environment pushed rich clients to continue shifting cash into higher-yielding assets, resulting in lower deposit levels.\u00a0Earnings amounted to $1.82 a share, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $1.65 a share.\n\nMorgan Stanley investors value the more steady nature of the wealth management business due to its more predictable nature compared to investment banking and trading. However, its usual dynamic got flupped as institutional securities division earn more revenue compared to its wealth management division.\n\nBank Of America Promised A\u00a0NII Rebound\n\nFor the June quarter, Bank of America reported revenue grew less than 1% to $25.54 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $25.22 billion.\u00a0Profit slipped 6.9% YoY to $6.9 billion, or 83 cents a share,\u00a0also topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of 80 cents.\n\nInvestment banking fees rose 29% to $1.56 billion while asset management fees grew 14% to $3.37 billion, and wealth management division reported a 6.3% revenue growth of $5.57 billion.\u00a0Net interest income contracted 3% to $13.86 billion.\n\nBut net interest income fourth quarter guidance of $14.5 billion gave hope of a turnaround this year. Aided by this guidance, shares grew 5.4%.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "7 Long-Term Tech Stocks for Extending Investment Horizons",
        "content": "Is the tech trade really over? Much is being written about investors rotating capital out of high-flying technology names and into value and small-cap stocks. While the rotation is seen as healthy and likely to prolong the current market rally that began in late 2022, it seems doubtful that technology stocks will trail for long.\n\nFirst of all, tech firms tend to be the engines of innovation and growth in the economy. That fact has only accelerated with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Second, the quarterly financial results of technology companies justify their stock\u2019s performance and lofty valuations. With the economy and consumer spending remaining resilient, there\u2019s no reason to assume that there will be an earnings downturn.\n\nLastly, technology companies, particularly the mega-cap variety, have a dominant position in the markets in which they compete. Some, it can be argued, have near-monopoly positions. That also looks unlikely to change or be seriously challenged in the near future. Here are seven longevity tech stocks extending investment horizons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe good news keeps on coming for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The latest tailwind for the stock is that it\u2019s being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing\r\npharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). SMCI stock will officially start trading on the Nasdaq 100 July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest non-financial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should give its stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will now be required to buy its shares. Super Micro Computer makes servers that run AI microchips and processors and its products are in high demand worldwide. SMCI stock has more than tripled so far in 2024. Earlier this year, the company\u2019s stock was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index where it remains the top performing security.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of winning tech stocks, how about software firm turned Bitcoin (BTC-USD) powerhouse MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)? The company\u2019s stock has performed nearly as well this year as Super Micro Computer. Since January, MSTR stock has gained 141%, driving its share price up to $1,654.18 and leading the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split that goes into effect on August 8.\n\nWhile technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. Michael Saylor, the company\u2019s executive chairman, has said that MicroStrategy is now primarily focused on Bitcoin development and blockchain technologies. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $14.59 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Bernstein recently said that MicroStrategy is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin company\u201d and that the stock has a further 80% upside.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-known as a leader in AI. However, Alphabet is still a diversified technology company that has its tentacles in many other areas of technology, from smartphones to cybersecurity. The company\u2019s role in cybersecurity looks likely to expand with the expected acquisition of Wiz, a privately held firm that specializes in cybersecurity for cloud computing.\n\nMultiple media reports say Alphabet is planning to spend $23 billion to purchase Wiz, in what would be its biggest acquisition ever. Wiz was founded in 2020 and had been planning an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. However, it now looks as though Wiz will be content to sell itself to Alphabet instead. The purchase comes as Alphabet makes growing its cybersecurity offerings a key priority.\n\nIn 2022, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen 33% so far this year and the consensus rating among 38 analysts who cover the company is that the shares are a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also holds one, along with a median price target that is 17% above where the stock currently trades. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently named Dell a \u201ctop pick\u201d and said the company\u2019s share price could rise as much as 40% over the next 12 months. At the start of July, Dell stock was added to Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) coveted \u201cU.S. 1 List\u201d of top investment ideas.\n\nThe bullish sentiment is due to the opportunity Dell has in front of it with AI, notably the servers that run AI applications and models. That business is expected to accelerate and become more profitable in coming quarters. At the same time, Dell\u2019s core personal computer (PC) business is expected to outperform in coming quarters as a global refresh leads to accelerating PC sales this year and throughout 2025.\n\nDELL stock has increased 80% so far this year, with more gains likely, according to analysts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs far as bullish sentiment goes, few stocks have experienced as big a turnaround in recent weeks as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). At the start of the year, Apple couldn\u2019t do anything right. The media was awash with headlines about slumping iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and a new augmented reality headset that, at more than $3,000, was too expensive for most consumers. But ever since Apple unveiled its AI strategy in June, its been blue skies for the company\u2019s stock.\n\nAAPL stock has risen 40% from a 52-week low reached in April. The shares are now up 25% on the year and trading near an all-time high on a split adjusted basis. The rebound comes after Apple announced plans to add advanced AI technology to future versions of the iPhone. Analysts say the addition of AI should spur global sales of the smartphone in coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has just expanded sales of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, rolling it out in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and U.K. Suddenly, Apple stock looks unstoppable once again.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nAs mentioned with Alphabet, cybersecurity remains a hot corner of technology right now. And among cybersecurity stocks, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the king. Over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has increased 143%, including a 50% gain so far this year. Analysts and investors stood up and cheered after the company\u2019s last financial results, which beat Wall Street estimates across the board.\n\nCrowdStrike reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue for the year\u2019s first three months totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales. CrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from a year ago. If there\u2019s a knock on CRWD stock it is the valuation.\n\nShares currently trade at nearly 700x future earnings estimates. While pricey, many analysts continue to see CrowdStrike as the de facto leader among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll end with a dark horse candidate: design software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company behind products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF has seen its share price driven 3% lower this year over concerns that AI is going to effectively put it out of business. However, reports of Adobe\u2019s demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated based on the company\u2019s most recent quarterly print.\n\nADBE stock rose 17% after the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year guidance. Adobe announced Q1 EPS of $4.48 compared to $4.39 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $5.31 billion versus $5.29 billion that had been estimated. Sales rose 10% from a year earlier. Rather than be replaced by AI, management said on an earnings call that they are using the technology to their advantage.\n\nSpecifically, Adobe is adding AI across its suite of creative products, including Firefly and Illustrator, and charging a premium for it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Pulse Survey Reveals Mixed Sentiment Amid Hot Market and Cool Inflation",
        "content": "Credit: Morgan Stanley\n\nNEW YORK, July 17, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley Wealth Management today announced results from its quarterly individual investor pulse survey:\n\nAmid record market highs, bullishness remains elevated. 61% of investors are bullish this quarter\u2013in line with last quarter (60%). And higher prices continue to be a concern. Inflation remains the top concern for investors (54%), followed by the 2024 election (34%), market volatility (22%), and a recession (20%). Investors are skeptical on rate cuts. Less than half (48%) believe the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to cut rates this quarter, down from 51% last quarter. Though the majority believe cuts are on the horizon. 54% believe the Fed will cut rates in the second half of the year. And many believe the market will continue to rise before Q4. Over half of investors (59%) predict the market will rise by the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"It\u2019s understandable to see bullishness remaining steady this quarter as the market pushed higher driven by mega-caps,\" said Chris Larkin, Managing Director, Head of Trading and Investing, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. \"On the flipside, the narrow market could make some traders jittery especially when compounded by a higher for longer rate stance from the Fed. So, it\u2019s easy to see how investors can have mixed emotions about where we stand when it comes to the market and the economy.\"\n\nThe survey explored investor views on sector opportunities for the third quarter of 2024:\n\nIT \u2013 Tech continues to take the leading spot for investor interest, as mega-cap tech names dominate, with the chips and AI space holding its ground. Energy \u2013 As oil prices trended higher, positive views of energy stocks mounted this quarter. Health care \u2013 Amid political and economic uncertainty, investors continue to look at health care\u2014a traditionally defensive sector, although interest dipped from the previous quarter by 2 percentage points as the market moved higher.\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThis wave of the survey was conducted from July 1 to July 16 of 2024 among an online US sample of 891 self-directed investors, investors who fully delegate investment account management to financial professionals, and investors who utilize both. The survey has a margin of error of \u00b13.20 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. It was fielded and administered by Dynata. The panel is broken into three investable assets: less than $500k, between $500k to $1 million, and over $1 million. The panel is 60% male and 40% female and self-select as having moderate+ investing experience, with an even distribution across geographic regions, and age bands.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley Wealth Management\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, a global leader, provides access to a wide range of products and services to individuals, businesses and institutions, including brokerage and investment advisory services, financial and wealth planning, cash management and lending products and services, annuities and insurance, retirement and trust services.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley became the latest big Wall Street bank to tap the US investment-grade market Wednesday after reporting earnings, as strong investor demand helps lenders borrow at lower yields than would have been possible at the start of the month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown on China BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting HSBC Names Elhedery CEO, Picking Insider for Top Job Amazon Sold a Used Diaper.

The longest portion of the offering, an 11-year security, may yield around 1.4 percentage point above Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\n\nProceeds from the offering will be used for general purposes and Morgan Stanley is the sole underwriter of the deal, added the person.

Morgan Stanley, like its rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., beat expectations, solidifying the markets business as a hot spot across the industry.\n\nJPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman have raised a combined $16.5 billion after reporting second-quarter earnings. Wednesday\u2019s deal by Morgan Stanley is expected to turbocharge volume from the six biggest banks past the 10-year July average of roughly $17 billion.\n\nBlue-chip bond yields have fallen to the lowest in five months as Federal Reserve officials step up signals that they are moving closer to cutting interest rates. The average US high-grade yield-to-worst, a measure of borrowing costs, hit 5.21% on Tuesday, the lowest since Feb. 6.\n\nFalling yields and strong investor demand have created an attractive playing field for the big banks. Goldman\u2019s $5.5 billion, two-tranche deal on Tuesday garnered $23 billion in peak investor demand, wrote Bloomberg\u2019s Brian Smith.\n\nThat enabled Goldman to tighten pricing 28 basis points on both tranches, offering investors just 2 basis points to 3 basis point in new issue premium, or the extra yield that high-grade borrowers have to offer to sell new investment-grade debt, wrote Smith.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s $2 billion perpetual securities offering, the first preferred stock series by one of the so-called Big Six lenders in the US in almost two months, received more than $8 billion in orders, according to Smith. That enabled the bank to tighten pricing an eye-popping 52.5 basis points from the initial price talk.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more in the IG ANALYSIS: Goldman, Wells Achieve Attractive Funding Levels\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.\n\nAnd unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.\n\nYour parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.\n\nYears ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.\n\nThat means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.\n\nAnd lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?\n\nInvest in Dividend Stocks\n\nWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).\n\nLook for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.\n\nOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.\n\nHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.93 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.2%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.19% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.53%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 9.68%. Check Morgan Stanley dividend history here>>>\n\nStory continues\n\nTanger (SKT) is paying out a dividend of $0.28 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.93% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.17% and the S&P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 12.24% over the past year. Check Tanger dividend history here>>>\n\nCurrently paying a dividend of $1.9 per share, Virtus Investment Partners (VRTS) has a dividend yield of 3.12%. This is compared to the Financial - Investment Management industry's yield of 2.42% and the S&P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 15.15%. Check Virtus Investment Partners dividend history here>>>\n\nBut aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?\n\nIt is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.\n\nAn upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.\n\nThinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.\n\nIf you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks That Just Raised Their Payouts: July 2024",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are a powerful multiplier. Not only do investors benefit from capital appreciation from the stock but their portfolios are supercharged by the dividend payments increasing total returns.\n\nThe best dividend stocks to buy are those that consistently grow the payout. It\u2019s not a one-and-done situation. They raise their payout year after year, compounding and amplifying the effects. It\u2019s like turbo boosting your portfolio\u2019s growth engine.\n\nIt is why investors love Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings. These are companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years and 50 years, respectively.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, there are other stocks that have solid track records of raising their payouts though just not as long \u2014 yet. These dividend growth stocks reward investors through share price increases and rising dividend payouts. Many bolster shareholder returns further by buying back stock.\n\nThe following dividend stocks just hiked their payouts and represent some of the best dividend stocks to buy today.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrocery store giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) recently announced it was raising its payout by 10%. The dividend will grow to $1.28 per share from $1.16 per share. It marks the 18th consecutive annual increase in the payout, which has grown by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5% since the dividend was reinstated in 2006.\n\nKroger is the largest pure-play supermarket stock with over 2,700 stores. It is in the middle of trying to acquire the Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) chain of supermarkets, though it is being opposed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on antitrust concerns. The regulatory agency is suing the companies to block the merger. Together, the two supermarkets would have around 5,000 stores.\n\nTo get around the objections, Kroger and Albertsons have agreed to boost the number of stores they will divest to 579, up from 413. They will sell the locations to C&S Wholesale Grocers, the largest wholesale grocery supply company in the U.S. and the owner of grocery store chains including Piggly Wiggly and Grand Union.\n\nEven if the acquisition fails, Kroger represents a good dividend stock to buy. The stock trades at 11 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales. Wall Street expects earnings to triple over the next five years, from a 2.4% CAGR over the last half decade to 8%.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou can tell it was a good year for financial stocks as numerous banks and investment banking firms were hiking their dividends. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was one of the best, hiking its payout by 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther big banking concerns like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all followed suit with increases around 8% or so. One of the disappointments, though, was U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), which only raised its dividend 2%. As that is less than inflation, investors are actually receiving less money than they previously did.\n\nGoldman Sachs is trying to correct the errors of its past ways. Having expanded into consumer-facing finance, it found the business yielded poor returns. The investment banking giant ended up closing down and selling off many of those business. It wants to now just focus on its investment banking, trading and investment management operations.\n\nWith analysts forecasting long-term earnings growth of twice the rate it previously did, Goldman Sachs stock is trading at a significant discount. With a 12-year history of raising its payout and a 7.8% CAGR for the past year, the reformed investment bank is a dividend stock worth buying.\n\nJefferies Financial Group (JEF) A photo of a hand holding a smartphone showing the Jefferies logo while in the background, a monitor shows the Jefferies website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/ShutterStock.com\n\nIn that same financial services vein is Jefferies Financial Group (NYSE:JEF). But it hiked its dividend by a rather large 16.7%. That should be no surprise to investors. The investment banking firm has increased the payout at a 19% CAGR while over the last five years raised it 22% annually.\n\nJEF earns significant fees from capital markets activities, underwriting, financial advisory and asset management services. It generated $1.7 billion in second-quarter revenues, up 60% year-over-year (YOY). Over the first half of 2024, they are up 46%, indicating just how active the deal-making market has been.\n\nInvestment bank and capital markets in particular have seen robust growth with revenue 29% higher this year. Its asset management business had de minimis revenues last year but it generated $430 million from it through the first two quarters of this year.\n\nWith corporate merger and acquisition activity set to grow 20% in 2024, according to EY-Parthenon, look for Jefferies Financial Group to gain a good portion of that work that will flow to its bottom line.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) olive garden (dri) sign on front of building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse is the next dividend stock that generously raised its dividend. Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) increased the payout 6.9% to $1.40 per share from $1.31 per share.\n\nFiscal 2024 revenue grew 3.5% to almost $3 billion with Olive Garden rising less than 1%, LongHorn Steakhouse up over 7% and its fine dining chains like Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse, Eddie V\u2019s, Seasons 52 and Capital Grille was up 55%. That is distorted a bit because Darden acquired Ruth\u2019s Chris in June 2023. Absent the chain\u2019s inclusion, DRI\u2019s total sales increased 8.6% on a 1.6% rise in same store sales.\n\nDarden Restaurants has paid a dividend every year since 1995 and has steadily increased it every year since 2015. However, during the pandemic when restaurants were forced to close, it did cut the payout. But beginning in 2021 it resumed its regular payments and continued its policy of raising the dividend.\n\nAssuming no global health calamity strikes again, Darden Restaurants is a dividend stock worth buying.\n\nCitigroup (C) A Citibank (C) sign hangs on a Citibank office in Hong Kong. Citigroup layoffs\n\nSource: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com\n\nYet another financial stock was rushing to boost its payout. This time Citigroup (NYSE:C) raised its dividend by 5.7%. The bank is another turnaround play in the financial sector. So far it is successfully exceeding its targets.\n\nJust-reported second-quarter results beat analyst revenue and earnings expectations. Revenue of $20.14 billion was ahead of Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $20.07 billion while earnings of $1.52 per share easily topped estimates of $1.39 per share. Citigroup also benefited strongly from the rebound in Wall Street activity. The bank\u2019s investment banking revenue rocketed 60% higher to $853 million.\n\nYet, Citigroup is still\u00a0a work in progress. Only last week, The Federal Reserve rebuked the bank for making insufficient progress on data and risk management. It was fined $60 million. But, it did pass the Fed\u2019s annual stress test, and its required capital buffer was lowered to 4.1% from 4.3%. Citigroup\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, capital ratio is 12.1%, which is 13.5% above the regulatory minimums.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s improved financial picture allowed the bank to raise its dividend from 53 cents to 56 cents per share.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeavy equipment maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a rock-solid dividend stock that just increased its payout by 11 cents to $1.41 per share, which is an 8% hike. Also, the company added $20 billion to its stock buyback program, giving it a total of $21.8 billion to repurchase shares. And, CAT said it continues to use virtually all the free cash flow produced by its primary operations for dividends and buybacks.\n\nCaterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its payout for 30 consecutive years. Impressively, it\u2019s made a payment every year since going public in 1933.\n\nShares are up 13% in 2024 and 32% over the past year, yet the stock has historically been cyclical. You don\u2019t want to buy a cyclical stock at peak earnings because a downturn will inevitably follow. But that could be changing for Caterpillar.\n\nBecause its heavy equipment is increasingly used to build alternative energy infrastructure, mine metals needed for electric vehicles and provide equipment for generating electricity used by EVs, Caterpillar\u2019s cyclicality may diminish over time. However, it currently still relies upon more traditional mining and construction activity so it should greatly benefit from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill passed in 2021. There remains a long tailwind of growth that will push Caterpillar higher.\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) graphic of the phrase ETF sitting on a computer in front of an increasing line graph on top of a bar graph. Best Funds for Aggressive Investors. Best Growth ETFs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock that hiked its dividend recently is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds about 100 dividend-paying stocks and yields 3.6% annually. Its dividend was raised by a whopping 35%, from 61 cents per share to 82 cents per share. However, some caveats come with that.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s dividends aren\u2019t static but change every quarter. They can also decline, though such instances are rare.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF was created in 2011 with the purpose of tracking the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. As a result, it has a strong record of dividend growth with payouts expanding by a compound annual rate of 10.5% for the past decade.\n\nAs the premiere dividend growth stock to own, its top three holdings are Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Despite the latest report showing an easing of inflation, home prices continue to rise due to a lack of supply and high interest rates. Price increases have accelerated since February after a brief slowdown late last year.\n\nWith two Fed rate cuts expected by December, mortgage rates should decrease. This may bring more buyers to the market, making now a good time to consider which stocks to buy.\n\nFannie Mae\u2019s survey found 81% of prospective buyers think now is a bad time to buy a house. The housing market index has steadily improved over two years, suggesting conditions may support increased demand driving prices. Although the market should stabilize by year-end, prices are forecast to rise above inflation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the latest CoreLogic report, home prices rose 5.3% annually and will likely continue rising, though the increase rate may ease later this year. High prices have reduced buyer demand, however, demand is improving. The rise in housing demand could benefit certain companies, offering investment opportunities.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) provide less risky exposure to market trends.

(CSGP) logo\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) provides data and analytics services to hospitality and real estate firms through services such as CoStar Market Analytics and CoStar Property.\n\nWhile the company does not sell property directly, it could benefit substantially from an increase in transaction fees if the housing market improves. Higher home prices imply higher commissions, making CSGP one of the stocks to buy.\n\nDespite challenges in the overall real estate market, the company grew sales 12% over the last 12 months. Following improved first-quarter performance, management increased full-year guidance.\r\n\r\nWith real estate market pressures, the CSGP stock price has declined this year, down 13% as expected. However, the company invested over $100 million in marketing over the last year, negatively impacting profits. This should now help generate returns.\n\nAnalysts unanimously recommend buying CSGP stock, giving it an average price target 37% above the current price. Higher interest rates are anticipated to ease in the second half of the year, aiding the investment thesis.\n\n\u200bToll Brothers (TOL) Toll Brothers Home construction company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nToll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) is the second pick of stocks to buy on this list. The homebuilding company not only designs and constructs homes but also arranges financing.\n\nStory continues\n\nToll Brothers divided its operations into traditional home building, targeting suburbs, and city living, which unsurprisingly targets urban areas with apartment complexes. It also serves second-home buyers.\n\nThe firm has the highest average selling price of homes, so it could benefit more from a decompression of the housing industry, with lower mortgage rates allowing buyers to opt for more expensive homes.\r\n\r\nThe company has been holding back on paying dividends to its shareholders to conserve capital, reduce debt and build inventory in anticipation of growing sales. It says it sees strong demand and raised its guidance with its last earnings release.\n\nTOL stock exchanges hands at a +20% so far this year, yet it still offers a very cheap buy-in. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.4x, which compares low to the average of the real estate sector of 34.8x.\n\n\u200bCRH (CRH) homebuilders\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/Sashick\n\nThe Dublin-based building materials company CRH (NYSE:CRH) produces and supplies concrete, aggregates, precast modules and asphalt products. These materials are commonly used for new home developments, roads, driveways and building foundations.\n\nNotably, CRH generates over 64% of its revenue from U.S. operations. It recently completed a $2.1 billion acquisition in the U.S. while still increasing its dividend by 5%.\n\nAnalysts have a generally positive view of CRH stock, with a median price target of 23.1% upside potential. This is despite trading 15% higher in 2024, which makes CHR a solid pick in this list of stocks to buy. Notably, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently upgraded its rating from equal-weight to overweight.\n\nThe company also fits the definition of a value stock, trading at a P/E ratio of 17.5x while offering a dividend yield of 2.6%. This dividend yield bodes well with its 5-year average.\n\nLast year, EPS grew 22%, and the company forecasts similar growth for 2024. Growth estimates are at 24.90%, which is five-fold above the estimates for the S&P 500.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "An investment banking surge at Morgan Stanley (MS) solidified a dealmaking revival across Wall Street, but the company\u2019s wealth management unit fell short of analyst expectations.\n\nFees from investment banking jumped 51% from a year ago, the second-largest leap among big banks after Citigroup (C).\n\nInvestment banking fees also jumped at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) as dealmaking showed new signs of life following a two-year drought.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday about the investment banking rebound, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told analysts \"a number of folks have been calling for this.\"\n\nHe referenced earlier industry talk of so-called \"green shoots\" that failed to show up after some false starts in 2023.\n\n\"It has been sort of a delayed shoots, if you will,\" he said.\n\nThe pick up in investment banking and an increase in trading helped Morgan Stanley push its net profit up by 41% from a year earlier, to $3.07 billion. Its total net revenue of $15.02 rose 12%.\n\nBoth figures exceeded what analysts expected. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe stock was up more than 2% in Tuesday morning trading. As of late Monday, the stock was up nearly 13% since the beginning of January, trailing some of its other big-bank rivals.\n\nOne challenge that emerged Tuesday was Morgan Stanley\u2019s recent performance in wealth management, the business of providing financial advice to higher net-worth individuals.\n\nNet new assets in that division fell 59% from a year ago and 62% from the last quarter, to $36.4 billion. Revenues were $6.79 billion, which was a 2% increase from a year ago but a 1.28% decrease from the last quarter.\n\nBoth measures were weaker than analysts expected.\n\n\"The firm delivered another strong quarter in an improving capital markets environment,\" Pick said in a press release.\n\n\"We continue to execute on our strategy and remain well positioned to deliver growth and long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Q2 Earnings Beat on Robust IB &amp; Trading",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS second-quarter 2024 earnings of $1.82 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. The bottom line also compared favorably with $1.24 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nShares of the company plunged more than 3% in the pre-market trading on subdued wealth management performance.\r\n\r\nLike Wall Street peers, Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment banking (IB) business rebounded. Advisory fees surged 30% year over year. Further, underwriting fees witnessed solid momentum in the quarter. Specifically, equity underwriting income jumped 56% and fixed income underwriting income was up 71%. So, total IB fees (in the Institutional Securities division) grew 51% to $1.62 billion. We had projected it to be $1.24 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company also posted a solid trading performance. Equity trading revenues increased 18% year over year and fixed-income trading income was up 16%.\r\n\r\nLower provisions were another tailwind for Morgan Stanley.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite a 24% increase in interest income, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) witnessed modest growth due to higher interest expenses. Also, an increase in total non-interest expenses was a headwind.\r\n\r\nFurther, weakness in the wealth management business was a drag.\r\n\r\nNet income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP) was $2.94 billion, up 44% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $2.26 billion.\n\nRevenues Up, Expenses Rise\n\nQuarterly net revenues were $15.02 billion, up 12% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.18 billion.\r\n\r\nNII was $2.07 billion, up 3%. We had projected NII of $1.83 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest revenues of $12.95 billion increased 13%. Our estimate for the metric was $12.11 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest expenses were $10.87 billion, up 4%. Our estimate for the metric was $10.34 billion.\r\n\r\nProvision for credit losses was $76 million, down 53% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nQuarterly Segment Performance\n\nInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income was $2.05 billion, jumping 109% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same was $1.5 billion.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $6.98 billion, up 23% year over year. The upside resulted from increased advisory fees, underwriting income and trading revenues. We had projected revenues of $6 billion.\r\n\r\nWealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $1.82 billion, up 8% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.89 billion.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $6.79 billion, up 2%, driven by higher asset management revenues and transactional revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.78 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal client assets were $5.69 trillion as of Jun 30, 2024, up 16% year over year. We had projected the metric to be $5.41 trillion.\r\n\r\nInvestment Management: Pre-tax income was $222 million, jumping 31% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $276. million.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $1.39 billion, up 8%. The improvement was largely attributable to a rise in asset management and related fees. We had projected revenues the same as the reported number.\r\n\r\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, total assets under management or supervision were $1.52 trillion, up 8% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.5 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Position Solid\n\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, the book value per share was $56.80, up from $55.24 in the corresponding period of 2023. The tangible book value per share was $42.30, up from $40.79 as of Jun 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 17.1% compared with 17.8% in the year-ago quarter. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.3%, down from 15.8% a year ago.\n\nShare Repurchase Update\n\nIn the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley repurchased 8 million shares for $750 million.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company reauthorized a multi-year repurchase program of up to $20 billion of shares without any expiration date.\n\nDividend Hike\n\nConcurrently, Morgan Stanley announced a quarterly cash dividend of 92.5 cents per share, marking an 8.8% hike from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid out on Aug 15 to shareholders on record as of Jul 31.\n\nOur View\n\nElevated expenses due to investments in franchises will likely continue to hurt Morgan Stanley\u2019s profits.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.24 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $1.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.02, delivering a surprise of 19.53%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMorgan Stanley , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $15.02 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.95%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.46 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMorgan Stanley shares have added about 12.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 18.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Morgan Stanley?\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Morgan Stanley: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.61 on $14.15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.75 on $57.77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Investment Bank is currently in the top 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBGC Group (BGC), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on July 30.\n\nThis brokerage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nBGC Group's revenues are expected to be $545 million, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Second-quarter profits at Bank of America (BAC) fell 7% from a year ago as its consumer operations wrestled with higher interest rates, but it was able to churn out more investment banking fees and trading revenue.\n\nThe divergence between the businesses at Bank of America that serve Main Street and Wall Street reinforced a dominant trend this earnings season for the nation\u2019s biggest financial institutions.\n\nHigher interest rates and elevated deposit costs are eating away at more traditional consumer banking margins, forcing giant banks to lean more heavily on their trading and investment banking as dealmaking shows new signs of life.\n\n\"The strength and earnings power of our leading consumer banking business is complemented by the growth and profitability of our global Markets, global banking, and wealth management businesses,\" said Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBank of America\u2019s net income fell to $6.89 billion, which was slightly better than expectations, while rising 3% from the first quarter. Its total revenue of $25.37 billion rose slightly from a year ago.\n\nA key measure of lending revenue known as net interest income fell more than 3% from a year ago and more than 2% from the previous quarter, to $13.70 billion.\n\nThis margin \u2014 which measures the difference a bank earns by making loans and paying out depositors \u2014 has been tightening at many big banks due to higher rates and elevated funding costs.\n\nThis same measure also fell sequentially at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) as their customers continued migrating to higher-yielding deposit products like CDs.\n\nThere were other signs of challenges for Bank of America and its consumer borrowers. It set aside more money for future loan losses when compared with a year ago, a sign that it expects credit conditions to worsen.\n\nIts credit-card charge offs more than doubled from a year earlier and more than 6% from the last quarter, another signal that more of its customers are having trouble paying down their bills.\n\nBut there were some bright spots. Bank of America expects net interest income to rise later this year as the Federal Reserve starts to lower interest rates and the bank replaces under-earning bonds and fixed rate loans with higher-yielding assets.\n\nIt said it expected fourth quarter net interest income to be $600 million higher than its second quarter figure.\n\nAnd its Wall Street operations really stood out. Investment banking fees jumped 28% from a year ago while its equities trading rose nearly 20%.\n\n\"The fundamental trends have been strong capital markets and weak net interest income,\" Portales Partners founder Charlie Peabody told Yahoo Finance Monday, referring to the trends of bank earnings season thus far.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The question is if that spread income is going to reflect positively in the second half of the year.\"\n\nInvestment banking fees and trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.\n\nBank of America's stock rose more than 2% in pre-market trading Tuesday. As of Monday night it was up 20% so far this year.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Powell's speech, Bitcoin, retail sales - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell have cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in September. Investors will look to retail sales data for confirmation of a slowing economy, while there are more bank earnings to digest during the session. Meanwhile bitcoin has gained as traders see a Trump presidential victory as more likely after the assassination attempt.\n\n1. Cementing a September rate cut\n\nConfidence is growing that the Federal Reserve will agree to an interest rate cut in September, after Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s reasonably dovish comments on Monday.\n\nIn what could be his last public comments before the Fed goes into a blackout ahead of its July 30-31 policy meeting, Powell remained cautious but suggested that recent inflation data have been in the right direction for the inflation rate to return to the Fed's target of 2%.\n\n\"In the second quarter, actually, we did make some more progress\" on taming inflation, Powell said at an event at the Economic Club of Washington. \"We've had three better readings, and if you average them, that's a pretty good place.\"\n\nPowell also said he does not see the U.S. economy hitting major economic turbulence or an outright recession.\n\nThe comments were enough for markets to once again shift rate expectations, with traders anticipating 68 basis points of easing this year. A rate cut in September is now fully priced in, the CME FedWatch tool showed.\n\n2. Futures slip ahead of retail sales data\n\nU.S. stock futures slipped back Tuesday from record levels, as investors look for more clues about the health of the U.S. economy in the form of retail sales and bank earnings.\n\nBy 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow Jones Futures contract was 40 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 Futures dropped 9 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell by 22 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe main indices closed higher on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a new record high, as investors were buoyed by the perceived increased likelihood of a Republican president, which could pave the way for favorable tax and fiscal policies for investors.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Tuesday, mainly from the banking sector, but a lot of focus will also be on the release of the U.S. retail sales data for June.\n\nThis is expected to show a fall of 0.3% on a monthly basis, as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices.\n\n3. Trump selects Vance as running mate\n\nDonald Trump reentered the spotlight on Monday, receiving a rapturous welcome on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, just a few days after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump was officially nominated to be the party's 2024 presidential candidate, and announced U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate.\n\nThe four-day convention will culminate with Trump's prime-time address on Thursday, when he formally accepts the party's nomination to face President Joe Biden in a rematch of their 2020 race.\n\nThe attack has bolstered expectations of a Trump victory in the November election, particularly in the wake of Biden\u2019s weak performance in the first debate between the two players last month.\n\nPresident Biden gave an interview to NBC on Monday, dismissing concerns about his mental health and indicated that he had no intention of dropping his bid for reelection.\n\nThe race between Trump and Biden remains close, according to public opinion polls, though Trump leads in several swing states likely to decide the election.\n\n4. More bank earnings\n\nThe banking sector will remain in focus Tuesday, with the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the open.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stated, on Monday, that its profit more than doubled in the second quarter on strong debt underwriting and fixed-income trading, but slipped from a bumper first quarter when earnings were the highest since 2021.\n\nThe resilience of the U.S. economy has given corporate executives the confidence to pursue acquisitions, debt sales and stock offerings.\n\n\u201cWe expect that stock investors will be focusing on Q2's earnings reporting season over the rest of this month through early August,\u201d said analysts at Yardeni Research, in a note.\n\n\u201cIf earnings turn out to be better than expected (as we project), then the bull market should broaden as investors continue to discount cuts in the federal funds rate later this year, as they did on Thursday and Friday. The breadth of positive three-month forward earnings growth rates among the S&P 500 companies continues to widen.\u201d\n\n5. Bitcoin in demand\n\nBitcoin price rose on Tuesday, adding to the previous session\u2019s gains, buoyed by the prospect of friendlier crypto regulations in the U.S. if Donald Trump was to win a second term in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAt 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), Bitcoin rose 0.3% to $63,115, gaining almost 9% this week, and almost 50% year to date.\n\nSpeculation over Trump helped the token rise past concerns over selling pressure from distributions by defunct crypto exchange Mt Gox, which had seen Bitcoin crash to as low as $54,000 earlier in July.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound came after a failed assassination attempt on Trump, over the weekend, was seen as greatly boosting the former president\u2019s popularity.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely supportive stance towards the crypto industry, recently stating that the future of Bitcoin should be built in the U.S. and not overseas.\n\nThis contrasts with a slew of crackdowns against the industry by the SEC and the Department of Justice in recent years.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell's speech, Bitcoin, retail sales - what's moving markets\n\nThailand approves $2.8 billion soft loan scheme for commercial banks\n\nInvestors are optimistic but wary of geopolitics, BofA says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "IB, Trading to Support Morgan Stanley's (MS) Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "The performance of Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS trading business (constituting a significant portion of its top line) is expected to have been decent in the second quarter of 2024, supported by increased client activity. Thus, the company\u2019s trading numbers are likely to have provided some support to its quarterly results, slated to be announced before the opening bell on Jul 16.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, the likelihood of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, gradually cooling inflation and clarity on the interest rate path drove client activity. While volatility was low in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange, Morgan Stanley is likely to have recorded growth in trading revenues, supported by increased client activity.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.61 billion, suggesting a rise of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $2 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 16.6%.\r\n\r\nOur estimates for second-quarter equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $2.60 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively.\n\nOther Key Factors at Play\n\nInvestment Banking (IB) Income: Following the weakness in 2022 and 2023, global mergers and acquisitions witnessed a rebound in the second quarter of 2024. Both deal value and volume witnessed a remarkable comeback, driven by solid financial performance, fading recession risks, buoyant markets and expected rate cuts this year. Yet, tough scrutiny by antitrust regulators and lingering geopolitical tensions were headwinds.\r\n\r\nThus, Morgan Stanley\u2019s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have offered support to advisory fees in the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $498 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 9.5%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $488.7 million, indicating a 7.4% rise.\r\n\r\nThe IPO market activity was decent in the second quarter, given the impressive equity market performance. This also drove solid activity in follow-up equity issuances. Further, bond issuance volumes were boosted by lower yields, a better operating backdrop than last year, election-related uncertainty and a resurgence in M&As. Hence, Morgan Stanley\u2019s underwriting fees are expected to have improved in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $490 million, suggesting a rise of 24.1% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $363 million indicates an increase of 61.3%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $853 million implies a rise of 37.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $451.7 million, whereas the same for equity underwriting fees is $296.1 million.\r\n\r\nThus, growth in total IB income is likely to have been impressive, driven by the expected rise in underwriting revenues, as well as advisory fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.43 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 32.8%. Our estimate for IB income is pegged at $1.24 billion.\r\n\r\nNet Interest Income (NII): Given the clarity on the Fed\u2019s interest rate path for the year and the likelihood of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, the lending scenario improved in the second quarter. Per the Fed\u2019s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans was decent in the quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady in the quarter (at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%), Morgan Stanley is less likely to have recorded significant improvement in NII. Also, the inverted yield curve in the June-ended quarter and high funding costs are expected to have weighed on NII growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $1.91 billion, suggesting a decline of 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $1.83 billion, implying a dip of 9.2%.\r\n\r\nExpenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the June-ended quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have been elevated.\r\n\r\nWe expect second-quarter total non-interest expenses of $10.34 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts\n\nAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients \u2014 a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better \u2014 to increase the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is -0.83%.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings has been unchanged at $1.66 per share over the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a 33.9% rise from the year-ago reported number.\n\nMorgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMorgan Stanley price-eps-surprise | Morgan Stanley Quote\n\nThe consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $14.22 billion, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 5.7%.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nA couple of finance stocks, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases per our model, are Capital One Financial Corporation COF and Moody's Corporation MCO.\r\n\r\nThe Earnings ESP for COF is +1.52% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The company is slated to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 23.\r\n\r\nMCO is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 earnings on Jul 23.

        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Morgan Stanley Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) will release its financial results for the second quarter, before the opening bell on Tuesday, July 16.\n\nAnalysts expect the New York-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.65 per share, up from $1.24 per share in the year-ago period. Morgan Stanley expects to post revenue of $14.3 billion. It posted $13.08 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn July 9, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken maintained Morgan Stanley with a Neutral rating. Hawken also increased the price target from $100 to $105.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Morgan Stanley, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Morgan Stanley has a dividend yield of 3.27%. That\u2019s a quarterly dividend of 85 cents a share ($3.40 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Morgan Stanley, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Morgan Stanley's $3.40 dividend: $6,000 / $3.40 \u00a0= 1,765 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $183,719 worth of Morgan Stanley, or 1,765 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $3.40 = 353 shares, or $36,744 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on MS\n\nAlso Read: Top 4 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Rocket Higher In July\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nMS Price Action: Shares of Morgan Stanley fell 0.5% to close at $104.09 on Friday.\n\nRead More:\n\nAround $10M Bet On This Tech & Telecom Stock?

Trump set to receive Republican nomination this week\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention starts later Monday in Milwaukee, with former President Donald Trump set to receive his party's official nomination just a few days after narrowly escaping an attempted assassination.\n\nTrump is likely to be nominated as the party\u2019s frontrunner for the presidential race, with many analysts speculating that the shooting has actually increased his chances of a victory over President Joe Biden.\n\nThe assassination attempt has also appeared to have lowered the pressure from congressional Democrats for Biden to step aside in the race amid concerns about his fitness for office, as the party pulls together.\n\nSome Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate have publicly called upon Biden to drop out in the aftermath of his shaky performance in a June debate against Trump.\n\nBoth leaders counseled calm over the weekend, aiming to lower temperatures in a country whose deep political divide has grown even more pronounced during the presidential race.\n\n2. Futures rise with earnings, Powell in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures rose Monday as investors await a big week of corporate earnings as well as comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 135 points, or 0.3%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 17 points, or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 88 points, or 0.4%.\n\nThe second-quarter earnings season [see below] will be in focus this week\u2013more than 40 S&P 500 companies are reporting\u2013with investors wondering if the results will be strong enough to push the indices higher, given they are already at record levels.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a fresh all-time high above 40,000 on Friday, adding to the record highs the broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered last week.\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell will also be in the spotlight, as he is set to be interviewed by David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington DC.\n\nIn his recent testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell highlighted the central bank's ongoing efforts to tackle inflation and its commitment to a dual mandate, and investors will be looking for more clues over a potential cut in interest rates in September.\n\n3. Goldman leads off earnings week\n\nThe U.S. quarterly earnings season continues this week, with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) set to release its numbers later in the session after a number of its rivals started the ball rolling late last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expectations will be high after Citigroup (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported huge growth in investment banking revenues, even if Wells Fargo 's (NYSE:WFC) decline in net interest income disappointed investors.\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are expected to follow as the week progresses, as well as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the first of the tech giants that have driven much of the equity gains this year.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have jumped 10.1% year-over-year, based on LSEG data as of Friday, accelerating from 8.2% growth in the first quarter.\n\nS&P 500 earnings growth has been improving since a year-over-year decline in the second quarter of 2023, largely because of growth in tech-focused companies and optimism over artificial intelligence.\n\n4. China\u2019s economic growth showed in Q2\n\nChina's economic growth slowed in the second quarter, data showed on Monday, as a protracted property downturn weighed heavily on domestic demand.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy grew 4.7% in April-June, its weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023, and down from the 5.3% expansion in the previous quarter.\n\nSeparate data showed that China's industrial output rose 5.3% in June from a year earlier, slowing from 5.6% in May, while retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.0% in June, slowing significantly from a 3.7% increase in May.\n\nThis weakness places the focus on China's third plenum, a seminal event typically held every five years which starts on Monday, amid expectations Beijing will need to unleash more stimulus to support the economy.\n\n5. Crude stable despite weak Chinese economic data\n\nCrude prices stabilized Monday, with weak Chinese data balanced by raised political uncertainty.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.1% to $80.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $84.95 a barrel.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy registered its weakest growth since the first quarter of 2023,\n\nAdditionally, China's crude oil imports fell 2.3% in the first half of this year to 11.05 million barrels a day, amid disappointing fuel demand.\n\nThis data indicates the country is facing increased economic headwinds, and this is likely to bode poorly for crude demand in this vitally important market.\n\nThat said, losses have been limited with political uncertainty in the U.S. and the Middle East supporting prices.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTrump, Powell's speech, Goldman earnings - what's moving markets\n\nBurberry axes CEO and dividend, warns on profit\n\nFrance 'dangerously exposed' in case of economic shock, national audit office says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If you don\u2019t own at least one of the Magnificent Seven technology titans, odds are you\u2019re probably trailing the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Indeed, beating the market is tough without some help from the technology sector\u2019s biggest, brightest stars. After explosive rallies enjoyed in recent months, though, some may view the Magnificent Seven as less of a great deal. After all, we\u2019ve known about their AI potential for quite a while now. Yet, some new potential magnificent 7 stocks may be more deserving of the title.\n\nThough the AI boom still has room to run for many quarters or maybe even years, I don\u2019t blame you if you\u2019re in no rush to pick up shares of your favorite Magnificent Seven companies. Valuations are starting to get on the high side. And while some premium is deserved, it\u2019s all right to feel more cautious about the names while some trade at multiples not seen in decades.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t see a Magnificent Seven bubble forming, I find more value in alternative names, some of which may be worthy of similar status. Here are three:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a biotech innovator that\u2019s tapping into two of the hottest technologies around these days: GLP-1s and AI.\n\nOn the AI front, the company has teamed up with various AI firms, including OpenAI, to help find new medicines in a new, exciting, and hopefully faster and more effective way. As Eli Lilly deepens its relationship with some of the biggest names in AI, perhaps the nearly $850 billion biotech heavyweight is the way to play AI-assisted drug discovery.\n\nOn the front of GLP-1 (weight-loss) drugs, Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro landed a nice win this week. A recent study showed that Mounjaro outdoes Novo Nordisk\u2018s (NASDAQ:NVO) Ozempic when it comes to weight loss. That\u2019s a huge win that may crown Mounjaro the current king of weight-loss drugs.\n\nEverything Eli Lilly touches seems to turn into gold. Though expensive, LLY stock is still worthy of a look as it attempts to reach the $1 trillion market cap milestone.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen discussing potential magnificent 7 stocks, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is among one of the recently discovered AI winners. Its stock is now up 95% year to date, an impressive rally that may still have room to run in the second half. As AI servers look to gain traction, perhaps more than the GPU makers themselves, Dell stands out as a firm equipped that may just outshine the Magnificent Seven going into year\u2019s end.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 18.7 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), DELL stock still seems like more of a value play than a firm with a good footing and a steady pace to one of the biggest races in decades. Several big-name analysts are praising the firm as a Buy, including Morgan Stanley\u2018s (NYSE:MS) Erik Woodring, who has the name as a top pick over the potential for accelerating AI server momentum.\n\nWoodring will probably be right. As the AI boom rolls on, we\u2019re probably underestimating demand for Dell\u2019s offerings. Perhaps recent jitters over server margins are overdone.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) may not be the exciting AI stock to back up the truck this summer. However, it is a firm that\u2019s continued releasing a steady and stacked slate of streaming content. At the end of the day, Netflix is the streaming platform that has swum, as most other industry competitors have sunk.\n\nPrices have been steadily going higher, but for the most part, consumers are fine as long as there\u2019s still plenty to watch on the streaming service. If there\u2019s more value provided, many consumers are fine paying another two bucks or so. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters noted that price hikes will help the firm offer a \u201chigher diversity of shows\u201d and more \u201cquality.\u201d\n\nAs long as Netflix keeps giving customers what they want\u2014more binge-worthy content\u2014they\u2019ll probably be fine with even more price hikes as the inflationary era closes. That\u2019s strong pricing power, in a nutshell. It\u2019s also the kind of pricing that makes NFLX one of the potential magnificent 7 stocks,\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Morgan Stanley (MS) reached $104.09, with a -0.53% movement compared to the previous day. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.55%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.63%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the investment bank had gained 9.9% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector lost 2.67%, while the S&P 500 gained 4.28%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Morgan Stanley in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 16, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.66, indicating a 33.87% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.23 billion, up 5.74% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.81 per share and a revenue of $57.77 billion, representing changes of +24.73% and +6.69%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.23.\n\nOne should further note that MS currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.28. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Investment Bank industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.06 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector.

        "content": "BOSTON, July 12, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eaton Vance Municipal Bond Fund (NYSE American: EIM) (the \"Fund\") announced that, in connection with the recent close of the Fund\u2019s cash tender offer on July 9, 2024, the Fund has commenced a four-month measurement period, beginning July 9, 2024 through November 8, 2024, whereby if, during such period, the Fund\u2019s common shares trade at an average discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") of more than 7.5% (based upon the average of the difference between its volume-weighted average market price and NAV each business day during the period) (the \"First Trigger Event\"), the Fund will conduct a tender offer (the \"Initial Conditional Tender Offer\") within 20 business days of the date on which the First Trigger Event occurs. The Initial Conditional Tender Offer will be for up to 5% of the Fund\u2019s then-outstanding common shares at 98% of NAV per share as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the date the tender offer expires.\n\nIf the conditions of the First Trigger Event are met, then additional terms and conditions of the Initial Conditional Tender Offer will be set forth in the Fund\u2019s offering materials filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which will be distributed to the Fund\u2019s common shareholders, and in additional press releases, as applicable.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Based on Mary Meeker\u2019s AI Report",
        "content": "Mary Meeker, a prominent figure in the tech investment landscape, released a report last week urging a collaborative effort among the tech industry, government, and higher education institutions to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) advancement, highlighting potential stocks to buy in the EdTech sector.\n\nThe report emphasized the significance of the current moment, which Meeker describes as an \u201cinflection point of epic proportions,\u201d for the future of democracy and power dynamics globally. Meeker, known for her influential tenure as a Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst and her impactful \u201cInternet Trends\u201d report, which ceased publication after 2019, has been a vocal advocate for the tech sector.\n\nSince transitioning to venture capital in 2010 and founding Bond Capital, her insights have continued to shape industry perspectives. The latest report, titled \u201cAI & Universities,\u201d highlights the importance of partnerships between tech companies and academic institutions in maintaining a competitive edge in AI development.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeeker suggests that AI could revolutionize education by providing personalized lesson plans to address student learning gaps and by enhancing the role of teachers in the classroom. She envisions a future where educators can focus more on motivation and personalized technology-supported coaching.\n\nTo facilitate this vision, Meeker calls on tech companies to make their technologies more accessible to educational institutions. She underscores the importance of supplying schools with essential resources like GPUs, which are critical for running advanced AI applications.\n\nThe report also addresses the broader implications of AI on society, stressing the urgency for universities and regulators to grasp the potential of AI to influence both positive and negative outcomes.\n\nAlong these lines, here are 3 EdTech stocks to buy.\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) offers a vast library of online courses catering to a diverse range of subjects and skill levels. Its flexible learning platform and strong global reach make it a popular choice for both individuals and enterprises. It promises significant growth potential as the demand for online education continues to rise, making it one of the stocks to buy.\n\nIn May, this EdTech company saw its shares jump sharply after it topped market expectations for the second quarter and raised its earnings guidance. In response to this report, Citi (NYSE:C) analysts said there is still upside potential for the improved earnings guidance, which bodes well given the pressure seen in the broader sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Needham & Company analysts said the online education stock boasts an attractive valuation given its growth profile. For the first quarter, Udemy posted a 12% increase in total revenue year-over-year.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue (ARR) jumped 21%, while a net dollar retention rate surged 104%. This helped Udemy lift its full-year sales guidance to $800 million, up or down $5 million.\n\nStride (LRN) a clipboard with the words \"k-12 education\" written on a yellow piece of paper and in red marker\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStride (NYSE:LRN), formerly known as K12 Inc., focuses on providing online K-12 education and career learning programs. It benefits from the increasing acceptance of remote learning, driven by its comprehensive curriculum and personalized education models, appealing to families seeking alternative schooling options and vocational training.\n\nAs one of the stocks to buy, the company saw its stock target lifted at Citi from $75 to $77. The investment firm has also reiterated its Buy rating on its shares in response to third-quarter results and an increase in the full-year guidance.\n\nStride\u2019s Adjusted Operating Income forecast, expected to rise by roughly 4.1% in fiscal year 2024, has contributed to Citi\u2019s positive stance. Moreover, the EPS forecast has been bumped by 9.4%, with an average uptick of about 2.4% projected for the subsequent years. This enhanced EPS outlook has played an important role in Citi\u2019s decision to revise the price target upward.\n\nLaureate Education (LAUR) Metal die that says \"buy\" and \"yes\" on it with stock chart in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Sergei Elagin\n\nLaureate Education (NASDAQ:LAUR) operates a network of higher education institutions globally, primarily in emerging markets. Its focus on expanding access to quality education and strong presence in Latin America and other developing regions positions it well to capitalize on the growing demand for higher education in these markets.\n\nAs one of the notable stocks to buy, Laureate Education reported its first-quarter results for the calendar year 2024. Revenue increased over the year to $275.4 million. The com, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations\u2019s adjusted EBITDA, also exceeded forecasts, coming in at $30.6 million against the anticipated $25.0 million, marking a 22.4% beat.\n\nDespite the positive revenue and EBITDA performance, Laureate Education posted a GAAP loss of 7 cents per share, which did not meet analyst expectations of a 3 cent loss per share. However, this still represents an improvement from the 17 cent per share loss reported in the same quarter of the previous year. The company anticipates its full-year revenue to be around $1.57 billion, aligning with analysts\u2019 projections.\n\nPresident and CEO Eilif Serck-Hanssen highlighted the company\u2019s 25th anniversary and its commitment to expanding access to higher education, particularly in Mexico and Peru.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chip Stock Face-Off: A 10-Year Forecast for NVDA, MU and AMD",
        "content": "The semiconductor industry has been soaring, with chip stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soaring to nosebleed valuations amid the surging hype around artificial intelligence technology.\n\nSome people have seen this story play out before. Remember the dot-com bubble? While I\u2019m as excited as anyone about AI\u2019s transformative potential, I can\u2019t help but wonder if we\u2019re due for a reality check.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I still believe in these companies\u2019 long-term prospects. But it\u2019s hard not to feel a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The chip market has always been cyclical, and predicting its future means betting on the staying power of the AI revolution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWill the current AI frenzy fizzle out like the early internet did, leaving overeager investors holding the bag? Or will this prove to be a true paradigm shift with room for multiple winners? It\u2019s hard to tell unless we dig deeper. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nThe AI boom has propelled Nvidia to stratospheric heights, with the stock recently hitting an all-time high of $135 (post-split). Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm is palpable. Analysts are falling over themselves to raise price targets, with some projecting NVDA stock could go as high as $200 per share.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results were jaw-dropping, with revenue up 262% year-over-year to $26 billion. The company is riding massive tailwinds in AI, data centers, and gaming. Its GPUs are the gold standard for training large language models. And with the company\u2019s new Blackwell architecture on the horizon, Nvidia seems poised to maintain its technological edge. Its Compute & Networking segment has been booming. Chip stocks comparison: NVDA Compute & Networking segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nEven then, I can\u2019t help feeling a bit queasy about the stock\u2019s nosebleed valuation. At over 49-times forward earnings, Nvidia is priced for perfection. The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, and we\u2019re likely in the late innings of this economic cycle.\n\nThat said, the AI revolution shows no signs of slowing down. Companies are racing to build out AI infrastructure, and Nvidia remains the premier picks-and-shovels play in this sector. To justify its lofty multiple, Nvidia will need to keep delivering massive earnings beats. Anything less than stellar results could trigger a sharp pullback in this name.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ve been proven wrong whenever I\u2019ve doubted Nvidia. The company continues to deliver massive beats quarter after quarter. If this AI wave is truly as transformative as it seems, today\u2019s lofty valuation may end up looking cheap in hindsight. In the near-term, Nvidia looks risky at these levels. But zooming out over a five to 10 year time horizon, I still see tremendous potential. If the AI boom continues, $500+ per share doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Of course, that\u2019s a big if.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU)\n\nMicron\u2019s stock price has surged over 65% year-to-date on the back of the strong demand for its memory chips from data center and AI customers. The company recently reported solid Q3 fiscal 2024 results, beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue jumped 81% year-over-year to $6.81 billion, while 30 cents of earnings per share handily beat estimates.\n\nMicron is benefiting from some powerful megatrends right now, especially the rapid growth of artificial intelligence applications that require enormous amounts of memory and storage. The company is a key supplier to AI leaders like Nvidia, with its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips integrated into Nvidia\u2019s latest AI accelerators. Micron expects record revenue in fiscal 2024 and 2025 driven by these AI tailwinds.\n\nAnalysts are largely bullish on the stock, with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently upgrading Micron to \u201cequal-weight\u201d and hiking its price target. The firm cited better-than-expected AI chip demand as a key reason for its more positive stance. Of the 27 analysts covering Micron, 25 have buy ratings.\n\nHowever, I have some reservations about Micron\u2019s longer-term prospects. The memory chip industry is highly cyclical, and Micron\u2019s growth is expected to slow dramatically after fiscal 2025, unless AI demand significantly exceeds expectations. Micron financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock also doesn\u2019t look particularly cheap at around 14-times forward earnings, given the boom-bust nature of its business.\n\nSo while I believe Micron will continue to ride high in the near-term on the AI wave, investors should be aware of the risks further out on the horizon. I believe the stock could trade less than $300 a decade from now. I\u2019d love to be proven wrong, though.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAMD\u2019s strategy seems to be taking a page out of its playbook against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market \u2013 targeting budget-conscious companies and developers with its lower-cost AI offerings. The company\u2019s MI300 series GPUs are reportedly delivering strong performance for AI workloads at a better value than Nvidia\u2019s pricey H100 chips. This approach could be especially appealing to cash-strapped AI startups looking to keep costs in check.\n\nFinancially, AMD is already seeing a big AI boost, with data center revenue up 80% year-over-year in Q1 to $2.3 billion. Management now expects data center GPU sales to top $4 billion this year, up from a prior $3.5 billion forecast. Analysts are taking notice, with Piper Sandler naming AMD its top large-cap pick and New Street Research setting a bullish $345 price target for 2026.\n\nHowever, AMD still has a steep hill to climb to catch Nvidia, which controls around 70-95% of the AI chip market. And while AMD stock trades at a premium, its growth and margins pale in comparison to Nvidia\u2019s jaw-dropping numbers. Growth in the company\u2019s Data Center segment also hasn\u2019t been as eye-popping. AMD Data Center segment growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nSo, can AMD pull off in AI what it did against Intel in CPUs? Only time will tell. But if AMD can capture even a fraction of Nvidia\u2019s AI market share, the stock could have a long runway ahead, likely sending this stock above the $500 level in a decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "A Wall Street revival is carrying big banks as Main Street struggles",
        "content": "A Wall Street revival provided a second-quarter boost to big banks at a time of rising challenges for their Main Street consumer operations.\n\nInvestment banking fees jumped at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) from a year ago as dealmaking showed more signs of life following a two-year-long slump. Trading revenue was also up for all three institutions.\n\n\"We are happy to see the progress,\" JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.\n\nStocks of all three banks fell, however, as higher interest states and elevated deposit costs ate away at more traditional consumer banking margins. The banks also set aside more money for future loan losses when compared with a year ago, a sign that they expect credit conditions to worsen.\n\nWhat attracted the most attention from investors Friday was that a key measure of lending profit known as net interest income fell at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup from the previous quarter as customers continue to migrate to higher-yielding deposit products like CDs.\n\nNet interest income accounts for the difference between what banks earn from their loans and pay out on their deposits.\n\nThis measure at JPMorgan declined 1% from the prior quarter. If not for a $8 billion one-time accounting gain tied to an exchange of shares in credit card giant Visa (V), JPMorgan\u2019s overall net profit would have declined 9% from a year ago.\n\nIts stock was roughly flat in midday trading.\n\nThe decline in lending income at Wells Fargo was deeper than analysts anticipated, helping to push its stock down more than 7%.\n\nSeveral analysts hoped Wells Fargo might offer a higher revision to its net interest income guidance for the full year. Instead, the bank seemed more comfortable in a lower range, predicting it would fall between 8% and 9%.\n\nBut even Wells Fargo benefited from more Wall Street activity. Its investment banking revenues surged 38% to $430 million.\n\nAt JPMorgan, investment banking rose 50% from last year, to $2.35 billion. At Citigroup, those fees jumped 60% in the second quarter to $853 million.\n\n'Green shoots'\n\nWall Street has been waiting two years for this moment, enduring repeated false starts.\n\nLast year was supposed to be the year things turned around as executives touted a string of IPOs and merger announcements. Instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade, as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far this year, things are looking up despite lingering concerns about the inflation, geopolitical tensions and an uncertain presidential election outcome.\n\nThe second-quarter Wall Street results from JPMorgan and Citigroup were also a good sign for other Wall Street heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) that are due to report earnings next week.\n\nDespite the improvement, Barnum of JPMorgan was careful Friday not to get too excited about the investment banking performance as he cited potential headwinds. One potential problem is an intense focus from federal regulators on antitrust concerns, which some market observers say is depressing deal activity.\n\n\"The dialogue on M&A is robust, I would say, a little bit more elevated,\u201d Barnum said. But \u201cthere's a little bit of a chilling effect on M&A because of the regulatory environment, and that remains the case.\u201d Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. (Photo by Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also offered some general caution in a press release, saying that \"while market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks.\"\n\nHe referenced geopolitical tensions and persistent inflationary forces, adding that \"inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects.\"\n\nDimon did not attend JPMorgan\u2019s second-quarter earnings conference calls with reporters or analysts Friday.\n\nThe reason given by bank executives: a travel conflict.\n\nThe bank\u2019s spokesman told reporters Dimon was flying back from Germany after helping to celebrate the bank\u2019s 100th anniversary in that country.\n\nThe bank CFO, Barnum, told reporters \"it's a travel conflict, that's it. There's literally nothing more to it.\u201d\n\nBarnum said Dimon almost always attends the calls and \u201cthat should continue to be the expectation.\u201d\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?",
        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nBased in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 12.21%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.85 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.25% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.81% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.57%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 28.06%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nLooking at this fiscal year, MS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.81 per share, with earnings expected to increase 24.73% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Quarterly earnings season is about to quick start again, with key companies across the globe providing insights into how certain sectors are performing.\n\nInvestors next week will see updates from the mining world, with our focus staying on Anglo American, while Burberry will provide a gauge on the luxury goods industry after a slowdown in demand from China hit sales.\n\nIn Asia, semiconductor colossus TSMC is expected to come in above expectations, amid the artificial intelligence craze and ongoing demand for chips.\n\nAcross the pond, Netflix will try to convince investors it is as popular as ever, with revenue and earnings increases in the cards.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L) \u2013 Reports trading update on Thursday, 18 July\n\nAnglo-American was the target of a takeover bid by rival BHP (BHP.L) and it has announced its own restructuring plans in the aftermath of the failed mining mega-merger. So, investors will be sure to put the company\u2019s first-half figures under the microscope.\n\nAnglo is aiming to sell or separate its coal, platinum, nickel and diamond mining operations. What\u2019s left will be a streamlined business that contains the company\u2019s prized copper mines (BHP\u2019s main target), its premium iron ore business and the Woodsmith fertiliser project in North Yorkshire.\n\nAnglo is heavily exposed to copper and the industrial metal\u2019s price is just starting to pull back after a strong run.\n\nFor the actual earnings report, AJ Bell tells investors to look for any hints on production costs.\n\n\u201cThe details on the balance sheet, cash flow and profit and loss account will come with the actual first-half numbers, although do watch out for any changes in output forecasts and targets, as well as comments on cost of production and capital investment, since all of those will directly influence profits and cash flow,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How FTSE All-Share index listings are changing\n\n\u201cIn the unlikely event that [CEO Duncan] Wanblad discusses annual profits or the dividend ahead of the first-half results in the following week, the current consensus forecast is for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to come in broadly flat in 2024, at $9.7bn, while a cut in the dividend to $0.83 per share from $0.96 is expected.\u201d\n\nThe share price is still around 20% higher than it was before BHP\u2019s interest became public on 25 April.\n\nBurberry (BRBY.L) - Reports trading update on Friday, 19 July\n\nTrenchcoat-maker Burberry is not expected to impress investors next week, with retail same-store sales estimated to come in 16% lower in its fiscal first quarter, a slump made even starker by 18% growth in the same period last year.\n\nUBS expects the focus to be on Chinese sales \u201cas well as any signs of stabilisation/improvement among other consumer groups (i.e. Americans and Europeans)\u201d.\n\nJP Morgan has warned that the \u2018re-acceleration\u2019 of the luxury sector could be slower than anticipated, leading to downside risk for luxury stocks.\n\n\u201cThe troubled times continue for Burberry, which has engaged in a round of sweeping job cuts in order to reduce costs. Sales fell 4% for the year to the end of March, and it looks like demand in the key market of China will continue to weaken,\u201d IG said.\n\nShares in Burberry are down by more than half over the past year, to take them back to levels last seen in 2010.\n\nCompared to its five-year average PE of 17 times earnings, Burberry now looks cheap at 11 times earnings. IG analysts warned that while the dividend yield is a solid 7%, investors should be aware that the payout may be cut should the group\u2019s sales outlook continue to worsen.\n\nFor the year to March 2025, analysts currently expect sales to drop 6% to \u00a32.8bn.\n\nTSMC (TSM) \u2013 Reports quarterly update on Thursday, 18 July\n\nThe AI craze has pushed Nvidia as other Magnificent 7 stocks to new heights but there is no AI without chips. And they are (almost) all being manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s key tech giant clients such as Nvidia and Apple have almost nowhere else to turn for next-gen chip manufacturing.\n\nTSMC\u2019s anticipated order for next-generation two-nanometer technology will be a key catalyst in the second half, according to Citi analysts, who see AI and sovereign investment adding upside to the company\u2019s 2030 revenue target of \u20ac44bn to \u20ac60bn, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe Taiwan-based silicon giant disclosed in its latest monthly revenue report that net income for June was NT$207.87bn billion ($6.4bn), an increase of 32.9% compared with a year ago.\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFigures for May and April were NT$229.62bn ($7.04bn/) and NT$236.02bnn (\u00a35.41bn/$7.24bn), both up on the same period last year. TSMC is projected to grow sales by roughly 21% in FY24 and FY25.\n\n\u201cTaiwan Semiconductor is one of the most straightforward buy-and-hold options in all of technology alongside the likes of Nvidia and others because chips are the lifeblood of the economy and TSM is the semiconductor manufacturer,\u201d according to Zachs Research.\n\n\u201cAny near-term pullback down to some of Taiwan Semiconductor stock\u2019s key shorter-dated or longer-dated moving averages could mark a screaming buy signal for long-term investors,\u201d Zachs\u2019 analysts added.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) \u2013 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday, 18 July\n\nSynonymous with streaming services, Netflix will show investors how it is fighting to stay on top and prove it can keep attracting new subscribers amid fierce competition.\n\nNetflix expects its revenue to increase 16% year-over-year (YoY) to $9.49bn (\u00a37.3bn) in the second quarter of 2024 but analysts predict Netflix's Q2 revenue will be slightly higher at $9.53bn. In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix's revenue was $9.37bn, up 15% from the prior year.\n\nMorningstar equity analyst Matthew Dolphin provides a guide to what investors should focus on. \u201cWe're most interested in details on Netflix's ad-supported service, especially regarding how the firm is coming along in monetising it, as well as an update on the size of the ad-supported user base,\" he said.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we'll be looking to see if subscriber growth is slowing substantially after Netflix passed the tailwind from its password-sharing crackdown, and whether it will stop regularly disclosing this metric in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe will also be interested in international sales and subscriber growth. This will be a key driver for the company when/if domestic growth slows,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs AJ Bell writes, Netflix no longer gives specific guidance for quarterly net subscriber additions, although co-chief executive officers Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos did suggest at the first-quarter stage that net adds would come in below the first quarter\u2019s bumper 9.3 million (the best first quarter since the pandemic and lockdowns in Q1 2020). That took the total subscriber base to a fraction under 270 million, up from 233 million in Q1 2023 and 167 million before the pandemic swept the globe.\n\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, is also keen to look at subscribers: \u201cOne thing to watch for is the number of new paid subscribers in the second quarter. Management has already warned it\u2019ll be lower quarter-on-quarter due to the normal seasonal demand patterns. These have been a little skewed in recent years, but looking at 2018/19 numbers, net new subscribers were down 34% and 70% respectively across the first and second quarters \u2013 so don\u2019t be surprised to see something in that range.\n\n\u201cBest in class content is one of the reasons Netflix has been able to consistently deliver sector leading churn rates. It\u2019s expensive, but Netflix remains the only company set to increase content spend, giving a comparative advantage versus legacy media and its challengers.\u201d\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday, 15 July\n\nRobert Walters (RWA.L)\n\nOrkla (ORK.OL)\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS)\n\nBlackRock (BLK)\n\nTuesday, 16 July\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nIntermediate Capital (ICG.L)\n\nB&M European Value Retail (BME.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nMcBride (MCB.L)\n\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\n\nNCC (NCC.L)\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH)\n\nBank of America (BAC)\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS)\n\nOmnicom (OMC)\n\nWednesday, 17 July\n\nRenold (RNO.L)\n\nHVIVO (HVO.L)\n\nBHP (BHP.L)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nAssa Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\n\nSvenska Handelsbanken (SHB-B.ST)\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nCSX (CSX)\n\nUS Bancorp (USBC.VI)\n\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS)\n\nCitizens Financial (CZFS)\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL)\n\nAlcoa (AA)\n\nBank OZK (OZK)\n\nThursday, 18 July\n\nSSE (SSE.L)\n\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\n\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\n\nKier (KIE.L)\n\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\n\nABB (ABBNY)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATCO-A.ST)\n\nVolvo (VOLV-A.ST)\n\nEQT (EQT)\n\nPublicis (PUB.PA)\n\nNokia (NOK)\n\nVolvo Car (VOLCAR-B.ST)\n\nSKF (SKF-B.ST)\n\nAbbott Labs (ABL.MU)\n\nBlackstone (BX)\n\nDR Horton (DHI)\n\nTractor Supply (TSCO)\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)\n\nInterpublic (IPG)\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL)\n\nAlaska Airlines (ALK)\n\nFriday, 19 July\n\nBridgepoint (BPT.L)\n\nSchindler (SHLRF)\n\nKone (KNEBV.HE)\n\nSandvik (SAND.ST)\n\nSaab (SAABBS.XC)\n\nElectrolux (ELUXY)\n\nAmerican Express (AXP)\n\nSchlumberger (SLB)\n\nHalliburton (HAL)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "US Consumer Sentiment Falls to Eight-Month Low on High Prices",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US consumer sentiment unexpectedly declined to the lowest level in eight months in early July as high prices continued to weigh on Americans' views of their finances and the economy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Vows to Stay in 2024 Race Even as NATO Gaffes Risk His Campaign Biden\u2019s Putin-Zelenskiy Gaffe Deals Fresh Blow to Campaign Tesla Delays Robotaxi Event in Blow to Musk\u2019s Autonomy Drive US and Germany Foiled Russian Plot to Kill CEO of Arms Manufacturer Rheinmetall Jill Biden Has Some Explaining To Do\n\nThe sentiment index fell to 66 in July from 68.2, according to the preliminary reading from the University of Michigan. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight increase to 68.5.\n\nConsumers' expectations for inflation over the next year fell for a second month, to 2.9%, data Friday showed. They saw costs rising at an annual rate of 2.9% over the next 5 to 10 years, also edging down from the prior month.\n\nThe University of Michigan also released a special report on inflation expectations, a point of recent concern among economists. It found the divergence between average and median long-run expectations was driven by a small number of consumers and \u201cunlikely to reflect a fundamental deterioration in consumers\u2019 inflation expectations.\u201d\n\nData earlier this week showed inflation cooled broadly in June, with a key gauge posting its smallest advance since 2021. That bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interests rates in coming months.\n\nThat\u2019s also provided some welcome relief to consumers who felt squeezed by the post-Covid spike in inflation. Goods prices have led the way, actually declining over most of the past year.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market, which has powered consumer spending, has showed signs of cooling, a trend that could help dampen sentiment if it continues. Unemployment rose to 4.1% in June, its highest mark since late 2021.\n\n\u201cDespite expecting inflation to ease, consumers remain vociferously frustrated at the persistence of high prices,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement. \u201cAlmost half of consumers spontaneously expressed complaints that high prices are eroding their living standards, matching the all-time high reached two years ago.\u201d\n\nThe current conditions gauge fell to 64.1 from 65.9, its lowest since December 2022. A measure of expectations also declined to 67.2, an eight-month low, from 69.6 in June.\n\nBuying conditions for durable goods dropped to 85, the lowest in just over a year. Consumers\u2019 perception of their financial situation now and in the future deteriorated in July, with each falling to the lowest level since October.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe report noted the November presidential election may be weighing on consumers' expectations for the economy.\n\n\u201cWith the upcoming election, consumers perceived substantial uncertainty in the trajectory of the economy, though there is little evidence that the first presidential debate altered their economic views,\u201d Hsu said.\n\n--With assistance from Chris Middleton.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel At SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US producer prices climbed in June by slightly more than forecast on a pickup in margins at service providers, offsetting a second month of declines in the cost of goods.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Vows to Stay in 2024 Race Even as NATO Gaffes Risk His Campaign Biden\u2019s Putin-Zelenskiy Gaffe Deals Fresh Blow to Campaign JPMorgan Notches Record Profit on Visa Gain, Dealmaking Jump AT&T Data Hack Prompts FCC Probe, Raises Broad Security Concerns Tesla Delays Robotaxi Event in Blow to Musk\u2019s Autonomy Drive\n\nThe producer price index for final demand rose 0.2% from a month earlier, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data published Friday. Compared with a year ago, the PPI rose 2.6%.\n\nThe report on wholesale inflation follows the more closely watched consumer price index, which showed the first decline since the onset of the pandemic and put the Federal Reserve on track to start lowering interest rates as soon as September.\n\nThe PPI report showed services costs increased 0.6%, with nearly all of the advance tied to a 1.9% jump in margins at wholesalers and retailers. Goods prices fell 0.5%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade, a less-volatile measure favored by many economists, prices were unchanged. Compared with a year ago, the gauge moderated to a 3.1% rate.\n\nCategories in the PPI report that are used to calculate the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 were mixed. Still, analysts at Morgan Stanley and Capital Economics shaved their core PCE price estimates after the PPI release.\n\nAmong those categories, physician care costs edged up 0.2%, the cost of hospital outpatient care rose 0.1% and inpatient care climbed 0.5% \u2014 all more modest advances than in May. At the same time, airfares increased 1.1% and prices for portfolio management services climbed 1%. The June PCE price gauge is due later this month.\n\n\u201cThe PPI components that feed into the Fed\u2019s preferred PCE deflator inflation measure were significantly lower than expected for June and it looks like May\u2019s PCE gain could be revised down too, albeit only slightly,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.\n\nCosts of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, fell 0.2% \u2014 the third decline in the last four months.\n\n(Adds graphic)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel He\u2019s Starting an Olympics Rival Where the Athletes Are on Steroids\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, indicating a change of +33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.81 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +24.7%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.54 indicates a change of +10.7% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.23 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $57.77 billion and $60.76 billion estimates indicate +6.7% and +5.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $15.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. EPS of $2.02 for the same period compares with $1.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.6%. The EPS surprise was +19.53%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Thursday as Wall Street was slapped with profit-taking even as inflation showed signs of cooling, with focus now turning to the second quarter earnings season.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,641.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat at 20,444.25 points by 19:03 ET (23:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,123.0 points.\n\nSoft CPI data ramps up Sept rate cut bets\n\nConsumer price index inflation read softer than expected for June, which saw investors ramp up bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates from September.\n\nHeadline CPI grew a slower-than-expected 3% year-on-year in June, while core CPI grew 3.3%, also less than expected.\n\nThe reading saw traders pricing in an over 85% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, a sharp jump from the 65% chance seen a day ago, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nBut the softer inflation, coupled with other middling readings on the U.S. economy in recent weeks sparked some concerns that growth was cooling.\n\nWall St sinks as tech faces profit-taking\n\nBut despite increased optimism over interest rate cuts, Wall Street indexes retreated from record highs on Thursday, hit chiefly by outsized losses in technology shares.\n\nThe losses came as investors collected a measure of recent profits in the sector, which had steadily risen in recent weeks on hype over artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 0.8% in aftermarket trade following a 5.6% slump on Thursday.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2% after tumbling 8.5% after a report said the firm\u2019s unveiling of autonomous taxis will be delayed to October from August.\n\nTech was the biggest weight on Wall Street on Thursday, after driving a stellar stock rally over the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% to finish at 5,584.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite slid 1.9% to 18,288.62 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% 39,753.75 points.\n\nQ2 earnings season begins with banks\n\nMarket focus was now squarely on the second-quarter earnings season, which is set to begin in earnest with a slew of key bank earnings on Friday.\n\nJPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo &Company (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) are set to report earnings through the day. Next week, majors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are set to report earnings on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFocus will largely be on whether corporate earnings were impacted by high interest rates and sticky inflation, which were seen causing some cooling in the U.S. economy in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady as Wall St falls after CPI data; Q2 earnings awaited\n\nBoeing nearing deal to sell 777X jets to Korean Air, sources say\n\nGlobal EV sales up 13% in June, down 7% in Europe, Rho Motion says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks Poised for a Dramatic Plunge",
        "content": "What goes up must come down, and there are a lot of stocks that look vulnerable to a plunge right now. With the market at an all-time high, many stocks have seen their share price double or even triple in the last 12 months. Yet more than a few of these high-fliers look as if they\u2019re teetering on the precipice and could topple over on the slightest bad news.\n\nInvestors need to be careful as we enter the year\u2019s second half. Many analysts are warning of choppy waters ahead for the market. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) just warned of a stock market correction, forecasting a decline of 10% or more in the current third quarter. Should the predictions prove true with a market pullback, certain stocks look more vulnerable than others to a fall.\n\nSo, let\u2019s examine three such stocks poised for a dramatic plunge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) A Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs Bitcoin (BTC-USD) goes, so too goes cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Its earnings and stock rose in this year\u2019s Q1 as the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time high in March. But, it\u2019s likely to be a different story when Coinbase Global reports its Q2 results on August 1. While COIN stock is up 39% on the year, cracks are starting to emerge.\n\nIn the last month, COIN stock has declined 13%. The drop in the company\u2019s share price has come as the entire cryptocurrency sector has sunk. Ever since the Bitcoin halving event occurred in April, it reduced the available supply of the largest digital token by 50%. In one recent day of trading, the entire cryptocurrency market plunged in a 24-hour period, erasing $170 billion in market value.\n\nTherefore, the current environment does not bode well for Coinbase Global, which relies on cryptocurrency trading and deposits. The upcoming Q2 print could be an ugly one.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe current rally that has sent Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock up 45% since the end of June has been impressive. But it\u2019s not likely to last.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) maker is due to issue its Q2 print on July 23. And, it is likely to disappoint. Recent data concerning the company shows some worrisome trends. First, Tesla\u2019s Q2 deliveries were 5% lower than a year earlier. The stock has largely rallied because the latest delivery figures weren\u2019t worse than expected.\n\nSecond, it has just been reported that, for the first time, Tesla\u2019s share of the U.S. EV market has fallen below 50%. Data from Cox Automotive, a leading auto industry researcher, shows that Tesla now accounts for 49.7% of EV sales in the U.S., down from 59.3% a year ago. While Tesla is still the largest EV seller in the U.S., the company is losing ground to competitors such as Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F).\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the Q2 results show a continued erosion of Tesla\u2019s finances and market position, then the stock is likely to fall back into the red.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) have enjoyed a blistering run over the last year. But that run might be coming to an end. CVNA stock has gained 275% in the past 12 months, including a 163% year-to-date (YTD) gain.\n\nThe stock really took off after the used car retailer reported record financial results and turned a profit during this year\u2019s first quarter. The company announced EPS of 23 cents when Wall Street had been expecting a loss of 74 cents.\n\nThe strong print was attributed to efficiency gains in its operations and the reconditioning of second-hand vehicles. While the Q1 print and the stock\u2019s run over the last year have been exceptional, it\u2019s unlikely to last. This is because the shortage of new vehicles that occurred post-pandemic is now largely complete, and sales of used vehicles are declining while inventories grow on dealer lots.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to remember that Carvana has been here before. Despite the huge rally over the last year, CVNA stock is currently trading 64% below its all-time high reached in 2021. The decline occurred after bankruptcy concerns emerged at the company in 2022, decimating the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Morgan Stanley (MS) ending at $103.46, denoting a +0.83% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.02%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.09%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.18%.\n\nThe investment bank's shares have seen an increase of 7.52% over the last month, surpassing the Finance sector's loss of 5.14% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.44%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Morgan Stanley will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on July 16, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.66, showcasing a 33.87% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $14.23 billion, indicating a 5.74% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.83 per share and revenue of $57.84 billion. These totals would mark changes of +25.09% and +6.83%, respectively, from last year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Morgan Stanley. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.1% lower. Morgan Stanley is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nLooking at valuation, Morgan Stanley is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 15.03. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.96.\n\nWe can also see that MS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.25. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Financial - Investment Bank industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.16.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 70, which puts it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "BlackRock Counts on Jocular Ex-Trader to Boost Muni Business",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Not long after Pat Haskell took over Morgan Stanley\u2019s municipal-bond department in 2013, he handed out rubber bracelets with the letters \u201cEFD.\u201d He wanted his team to bring their best every f---ing day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android Asia\u2019s Richest Banker Gets Caught in Adani-Hindenburg Crossfire\n\nAnd it worked \u2014 during his tenure, the business rose in client rankings and found new ways to deliver revenue.\n\nToday, Haskell is trying to fire up another group, this time as BlackRock Inc.\u2019s head of municipal bonds. A key challenge facing the 52-year-old executive is how to reverse severe outflows from actively managed mutual funds after bouts of underperformance.\n\nInvestors have pulled roughly $13.7 billion from those BlackRock muni funds on a net basis since 2020 and its market share has dropped, according to Morningstar Direct data. Although performance has improved in recent months, the outflows have continued.\n\n\u201cBlackRock as an investment complex has come under fire this year from fund flows, competition and even outside activists,\u201d said Eric Kazatsky, senior US Municipals Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cHaskell has his work cut out for him to reinvigorate investor confidence on the open-end fund side, which continues to lose assets to alternatives.\u201d\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock is an investing behemoth with a suite of products ranging from traditional mutual funds to low-cost, exchange-traded options. The firm had $185 billion in municipal-bond assets under management as of the first quarter, up from $163 billion at the end of 2019. Much of that growth has come from funds that track indexes, known as ETFs, including MUB \u2014 the largest in the muni market.\n\nHaskell\u2019s appointment parallels a bigger push at BlackRock to encourage investors to rely more heavily on actively managed funds that account for 26% of its $10.5 trillion in assets under management. Unlike funds that simply track the market, actively managed funds have professionals combing through thousands of securities to identify opportunities and manage risks. They also charge higher fees, which means customers have little patience for poor results.\n\nHaskell declined to comment. Spokesperson Christa Zipf said the firm has made changes to improve performance over the past five years and pointed to its history and scale in muni bonds.\n\nStory continues\n\nBagpipes and Beers\n\nHaskell took the reins earlier this year from Peter Hayes, who retired after nearly four decades managing US state and local government debt. In his role, Haskell oversees active muni strategies for retail investors and institutions as well as a group that handles portfolios for insurers. It is still early in his tenure, but he has revamped a business before.\n\nWhen he became head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s muni-bond operation, it was trailing Wall Street rivals and needed to work better with Smith Barney, the wealth management business Morgan Stanley had just finished buying.\n\nHaskell integrated the retail and institutional desks to create a more effective team, said Nigel Key, who ran muni sales at the time. Within five years, Morgan Stanley was tied for first place alongside Citigroup Inc. in a Greenwich Associates client survey, and the wealth business had become one of the muni department\u2019s biggest customers.\n\n\u201cHe was able to forge an incredibly tight relationship with management on the Morgan Stanley wealth platform,\u201d said Key, who hired Haskell out of college for a job selling munis at Credit Suisse First Boston.\n\nRaised outside of St. Louis, Haskell was a defensive lineman at Union College before entering Wall Street. Associates describe him as gregarious with a strong personality \u2014 someone who could command a room and is good at motivating employees, but demands accountability.\n\nHe often roamed the trading floor, standing behind staff during big muni-bond auctions and economic data releases. On St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Haskell hired bagpipers to play in the office and after a long week he was known to bring staff to Hurley\u2019s, a saloon next to Morgan Stanley\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan\u2019s theater district.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to dangle that carrot,\u201d said Bernie Costello, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head muni trader from 2015 to 2023, who is now at FMSbonds Inc. \u201cSometimes you need the stick and he can definitely wield it. He\u2019s not a wilting violet, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nHaskell is also known for pranks.\n\nIn one instance, he spied a co-worker sitting on a balance ball at his desk instead of chair. He snuck up behind the employee with a pair of scissors and popped the ball, sending his friend tumbling, people familiar with the incident said.\n\nBlackRock hired Haskell for his \u201cproven qualities as a client-centric leader, team builder and as an innovator who embraces the power of technology to create value for teams and clients,\u201d said Zipf.\n\nActive Outflows\n\nHaskell is savvy about markets and ways to crank out fresh revenue, according to people who have worked with him. For example, he launched a trading algorithm for munis at Morgan Stanley. In another instance, he convinced management to make a risky-but-profitable bet on Puerto Rico bonds in 2019.\n\nHe will now have to use those skills to get BlackRock\u2019s actively managed muni mutual funds business growing again.\n\nAfter spells of weak returns, all but one of BlackRock\u2019s nine actively managed muni mutual funds outperformed their peer group median this year through June, with four in the top decile, according to Morningstar. Nonetheless, investors pulled $1.7 billion from those funds this year through May, even as muni mutual funds overall took in more than $11 billion.\n\nMost of the outflows have come from the two largest funds in Haskell\u2019s group, Strategic Municipal Opportunities and National Municipal, which both had trouble managing interest rate volatility during the pandemic and after.\n\nStrategic Municipal Opportunities had a $3 billion short position against Treasuries going into the pandemic as a hedge against rising interest rates, which backfired when investors piled into the safety of government debt. It suffered again in 2023 due to investments in Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority bonds.\n\nIn the five years through June 30, Strategic Municipal Opportunities\u2019s performance was worse than most of its peers within its class of municipal funds, according to Morningstar. It has lost about two-thirds of its assets since late-2019.\n\nNational Municipal was hurt by holdings in bonds that had long maturities and low coupons once the Federal Reserve started boosting rates to tame inflation. Those positions caused the fund to lose 10.2% in 2022, a more severe loss than most category rivals, according to Morningstar. The fund ranks below most intermediate duration funds over five years.\n\nIn aggregate, investors have pulled money from BlackRock\u2019s active open-end muni funds every year but one since 2020. Active muni funds overall have lost assets in just two years 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn May, BlackRock dismissed nine of the 55 employees on the muni team, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. Zipf, the BlackRock spokesperson, said BlackRock is always organizing its teams to better serve the market and improve performance.\n\nSome former colleagues say they are sure Haskell will prove himself at BlackRock, given his track record.\n\nHe will \u201cbring something fresh and different,\u201d said Costello. \u201cHe\u2019ll be grabbing the wheel in short order and doing the things he needs to do to to win.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The debt has 10-, 30- and 40-year maturities, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified. Initial pricing thoughts, announced after calls with investors, are at about 140, 180 and 195 basis points over treasuries for the three tranches respectively.\n\nAramco is seeking to raise at least $3 billion, and may increase the size depending on investor demand, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s government and affiliated companies have borrowed vast amounts this year, topping China as the biggest issuer of international debt among emerging markets. The government, which needs funds to help cover an expected budget shortfall resulting from an ambitious economic diversification plan, has accounted for more than half of the total debt sold by Saudi entities this year.\n\nAramco sold its first dollar bond in 2019 and followed with 50-year debt in 2020. It issued dollar-denominated Islamic notes in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company hired banks including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and SNB Capital to manage the latest bond sale, which may price later on Wednesday.\n\nThe oil producer is a big part of the kingdom\u2019s cash flow plans. In June, the Saudi government offloaded an $11.2 billion stake in the company and Aramco\u2019s massive dividend payouts \u2014 the biggest in the world \u2014 also help fill state coffers.\n\nIn May, the company maintained its $31 billion quarterly dividend payout to the Saudi government and other investors despite lower profit. Its free cash flow \u2014 funds from operations minus capital expenditure \u2014 of $22.8 billion in the period was less than the total payout.\n\nAramco is likely to use the funds to refinance existing borrowings and contribute to its investment program. The company is expanding natural gas production at home including $25 billion of contracts for the Jafurah project. It\u2019s spending billions to maintain oil output and pursuing acquisitions overseas, including tapping into LNG supply in the US and agreeing to take a share in an automotive joint venture.\n\nStory continues\n\nChief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed said in February that the company would sell long-dated debt this year as financial markets improve and the company looks to leverage its massive balance sheet. The plan to issue long-maturity bonds shows Aramco is confident it can remain relevant well past the middle of the century even as the energy transition raises questions over future oil demand.\n\n--With assistance from Hannah Benjamin-Cook.\n\n(Adds details on pricing in second paragraph, background throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects Morgan Stanley (MS) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 16, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $14.23 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.31% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Morgan Stanley?\n\nFor Morgan Stanley, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.39%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Morgan Stanley will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Morgan Stanley would post earnings of $1.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.02, delivering a surprise of +19.53%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMorgan Stanley doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Hot Stocks: 3 Contrarian Upgrades Signaling Major Trend Reversals",
        "content": "Contrarian stock upgrades might help you capitalize on this year\u2019s AI-inspired market rise.\n\nRegarding the prospects of a Federal Reserve rate reduction, the S&P 500rose 14.5% in the first half of the year, driven by technology and communication, which gained 28.2% and 26.7%, respectively. Big-cap growth stocks did well, at 20.7%, while smaller-cap stocks rose slightly.\n\nValue-conscious investors may uncover contrarian stock upgrades that surge against market sentiment, presenting possibilities that have not taken advantage of the 2024 market rally. These upgrades are cheaper than industry titans like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which gained 155% in the first half of 2024 because of rising demand for GPUs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPlus, contrarian stock recommendations against market sentiment are worth considering since experts aren\u2019t always right. Experts anticipated a flat or slightly positive S&P 500 return in 2024. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts a 6% rise to 4,700. With the S&P 500 at 4,500, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) also expected a flat return.\n\nHowever, the U.S. economy beat expectations; the S&P 500 exceeded 5,500 without concluding the year.\n\nAmid these market happenings, we\u2019ll look at corporations with mixed outlooks recently receiving contrarian stock upgrades, sparking fresh research for these ailing tech titans to benefit from the market rebound.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR), recognized for its ties to the U.S. military and intelligence, is rated \u2018Hold\u2019 based on 13 ratings. The company\u2019s average price target is $22.55, which suggests a 17% downside potential from the present $27.23.\n\nHowever, Argus Research, which rates the big data business \u201cBuy\u201d and sets a $29 price objective, disagrees.\n\nAnalyst Joseph Bonner pointed out that 55% of Palantir\u2019s 2023 income came from strong government contracts. Its growing business sector brought in 45%, with 38% coming from outside the US. Bonner pointed out that Palantir is focusing on making money in AI and finding business solutions.\n\nPalantir\u2019s triumphs in government and commercial contracts support the bullish argument. For the third phase of the TITAN program, which develops new military technologies, PLTR obtained a large U.S. Army contract. Palantir also secured a major DoD CJADC2 contract to build its Maven Smart System. Palantir powers Open DAGIR\u2019s worldwide network.\n\nIts AI platform expanded with 600 pilots in 2023, and 70% increased U.S. commercial income. Palantir and Voyager Space have also launched a major AI relationship to use AI systems in space research and defensive technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to attract attention through contracts and partnerships shows market potential; Palantir expects a big rise in revenue, with growth of at least 30% per year until 2025.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) used to be in charge of the chip business, but Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) are taking market share away, souring its outlook. INTC is a \u201cHold\u201d according to 31 analyst ratings. Twenty-five say the company should be kept, three say it should be bought, and three say it should be sold. This shows the market\u2019s feelings about Intel, which is falling behind Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThe experts at Wolfe Research upgraded Intel from \u201cUnderperform\u201d to \u201cPeer Perform.\u201d Analysts stressed that growth in server CPUs can\u2019t cover the high costs of Intel\u2019s 5N4Y strategy\u2019s capital and retirement costs by itself. Intel\u2019s manufacturing business won\u2019t break even until 2027, depending on how fast foundries grow. However, Wolfe Research thinks that gross margins will get better in 2025 as Intel buys more tiles and the cost of starting up the business goes down.\n\nAside from the rating, Intel deserves credit for working hard to compete with Nvidia and AMD. The Xeon 6 processors from Intel are the company\u2019s next version of CPUs for data centers. They are fast and made for AI jobs. Intel\u2019s Arc GPU is 50% faster, and its NPU is four times better. It is based on the next-generation Arc Battlemage design. In the AI business, this lets it go up against Nvidia and AMD directly. Also, Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 and 3 AI processors cost less than Nvidia\u2019s H100 and AMD\u2019s MI300X GPUs, which are excellent for helping the business regain some market share.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone.

PYPL now has 13 \u201cBuy\u201d and 16 \u201cHold\u201d recommendations, indicating a mixed outlook.\n\nIt\u2019s part of our contrarian stock upgrade research since Susquehanna upgraded PYPL from \u2018Neutral\u2019 to \u2018Positive\u2019 with a $71 price target.\n\nPayPal hopes to increase market share in small and medium-sized firms making cross-border payments during Christmas shopping via PayPal Checkout with Pay Later and Fastlane. Susquehanna believes PayPal will exceed transaction margin dollars and adjust EBIT dollar predictions in the coming years, and the stock is a suitable entry point.\n\nSimultaneously, PayPal has introduced six AI-powered commerce options to increase revenue: Fastlane\u2019s one-click guest checkout streamlines and boosts shop conversions. PayPal also introduced Smart Receipts, which employ AI to suggest and reward, and Advanced Offers, which target performance-based advertisers.\u200b\n\nPayPal launched the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain stablecoin PayPal USD to boost digital trade. Finally, the new PayPal advertising platform customizes ads using its huge consumer and merchant data.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Tech Stocks Heading for a Fall",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks, valuation matters.\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company\u2019s share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio helps to determine if a stock is expensive, or trading at a high multiple, relative to its peers or the overall market. Currently, the average P/E ratio among stocks listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index is near 25 times future earnings estimates.\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the average P/E ratio among U.S. stocks was closer to 17 times earnings. Stocks trading at extremely high multiples are often doing so because investors are banking on big future growth at the company, or because hype surrounding a stock is leading to a lot of people buying it. Value investors rigorously scrutinize valuations before buying a stock. Warren Buffett famously won\u2019t buy a stock that has a P/E ratio above 15.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three overvalued tech stocks heading for a fall. Don\u2019t slip up on them.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks pricey trading at 727 times future earnings estimates. In the last 12 months, CRWD stock has risen 167%, including a 57% year-to-date (YTD) gain. The sharp move higher has given CrowdStrike stock a lofty valuation. The high P/E multiple was one of the reasons the stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).\n\nPiper Sandler lowered its rating on CRWD stock to a hold equivalent neutral from an overweight buy equivalent rating previously. The analysts maintained their price target on the stock of $400. Also, Piper Sandler noted that CrowdStrike stock has few catalysts working in its favor currently. And, the risk/reward for the shares has become less favorable after the big move higher over the past year.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) looks woefully overpriced right now trading at 443 times future earnings approximations. The company, whose software is used in cloud-computing, has seen its share price rise only about 34% in the last 12 months. However, the move has still pushed shares of the company, which went public in 2019, up to extreme heights relative to its earnings outlook.\n\nInvestors are clearly betting on big future growth at Datadog, which builds cloud monitoring and security products that work with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other cloud platforms. Analysts are less convinced and have also been downgrading this stock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lowered its rating on DDOG stock to neutral from buy, dropping its price target to $105 from $123.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) looks pricey trading at 239 times future earnings estimates. AMD stock, which has risen 43% in the last 12 months, is more expensive than rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The latter\u2019s share price is up 203% over the last year but currently trades at a P/E ratio of 75. Some analysts speculate that the valuation is holding back AMD stock.\n\nSince hitting a 52-week high in March of this year, AMD stock has declined nearly 30%. Lackluster financial results are part of the reason. But so too is the premium at which the stock has been trading based largely on hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). In June, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) downgraded AMD stock to a hold equivalent equal weight rating from a buy equivalent overweight rating. The investment bank held its price target on AMD stock at $176.\n\nIn their downgrade, the analysts cited Nvidia as a superior option in the semiconductor space that\u2019s available at a cheaper multiple than AMD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and MSFT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "No matter your investing style, we all hope to find overlooked stock gems. These are where the biggest gains are made. But finding these stocks can be a challenge. Having access to information investors could only have dreamt of 30 years ago is a double-edged sword. It can be difficult to distinguish between hidden gems and hyped-up junk.\n\nAt times like these, it can be useful to follow analyst sentiment. But, by definition, overlooked stocks are stocks that either analysts ignore, or they\u2019ve turned negative on for the wrong reason(s). For this article, I\u2019m looking at stocks that one or more analysts have downgraded or lowered their price target in the last 60 days.\n\nAnalysts frequently think short-term. Buying the rumor and selling the news is common among this group. However, if you play the long game and you have a suitable risk tolerance, you can find overlooked stock gems like the three listed below.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) The Pure Storage logo at the entrance to its office in Mountain View, California. PSTG stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nPure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) may seem to be an odd choice for a list of overlooked stock gems. The PSTG stock price is up 73% in the last 12 months and 81% in 2024. That would make the stock more likely to be overvalued than undervalued. And that\u2019s what the analysts seem to believe.\n\nThe company reported a solid earnings report with year-over-year gains on the top and bottom lines. But, in a similar vein to Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), some analysts believe the growth is not enough to justify further stock price growth. In the last 30 days, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) have downgraded the stock, with UBS giving the stock a rare Sell rating.\n\nThe belief is that Pure Storage will have a hard time growing at the aggressive pace needed to justify its valuation. Adding to that concern is the growing competition in the data center space that the company occupies.\n\nNevertheless, analysts are generally bullish on the PSTG stock and have a consensus price target of 9% higher than its current price.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) Paramount Global (PARA) - Analyst Downgrades\n\nIt\u2019s always cause for concern when analysts initiate their coverage with a Sell rating. However, that\u2019s exactly what happened to Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). On June 25, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) initiated coverage on PARA stock with a Sell rating and a $9.50 price target. That comes after Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) downgraded PARA stock to Underweight and slapped a $9 price tag on the stock.\n\nThe issues surrounding Paramount are well-known to anyone following the stock. In the game of musical chairs that is happening in the streaming industry, the company is left without a chair. It can\u2019t find a buyer. The most public rebuke came as talks of merging with its majority shareholder, Skydance, fell through.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that may be changing. PARA stock is moving higher on news that the merger is back on. There are still many obstacles to clear, but if Paramount has a viable place in the streaming landscape, it may become one of the overlooked stock gems of 2024.\n\n2seventy bio (TSVT) Scientists in a lab\n\nSource: Matej Kastelic / Shutterstock\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for overlooked stock gems, penny stocks are a good place to start. That\u2019s the case for 2seventy bio (NASDAQ:TSVT). The cell and gene therapy company has just a $206 million market cap, but it has revenue \u2014 which is something many companies its size cannot claim.\n\nIn this case, the company received FDA approval for Abecma. It\u2019s a cellular therapy for advanced-stage multiple myeloma patients. The company developed the therapy as part of its collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). Better still, 2seventy bio recently received an expanded label for Abecma that may increase revenue.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been enough to placate at least one analyst. On June 6, Goldman Sachs downgraded TSVT stock from a Neutral to a Sell with a new price target of $2. And even with Wedbush maintaining its Neutral rating, analysts only give the stock a $5 price target.\n\nThis isn\u2019t unique for a company that is unprofitable at a time when interest rates remain high. But continued progress towards profitability combined with a rate cut may be enough to make these downgrades look overdone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a long position in PLTR.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Economists at Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc are having second thoughts about Turkish interest rates remaining on hold through the rest of the year after a faster-than-forecast start to disinflation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Struggles to Contain Mounting Pressure to Drop Out of Race House Democrats Consider Demanding Biden Withdraw From Race China Can End Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says Kamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels US Allies Say China Is Developing Attack Drones for Russia\n\nThe first slowdown in price growth in eight months has taken the most hawkish forecasters by surprise with a deceleration that was more abrupt than anyone had anticipated. Though it hasn\u2019t prompted an outright revision of calls quite yet, Barclays economist Ercan Erguzel said the central bank may make its first move in the fourth quarter instead of January.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Inflation Cools Faster Than Expected in Turnaround\n\nIt\u2019s a view echoed by Morgan Stanley, who\u2019d similarly penciled in a rate cut at the start of next year. The US bank\u2019s economist Hande Kucuk marked down her 2024 inflation estimate by a full percentage point to 42.4% and said she now sees \u201cdownside risks to our forecast for unchanged rates this year.\u201d\n\nGlobal banks have until now been split over the likely timing of the first rate cut, with a slight majority of respondents in a Bloomberg survey expecting the first move down from 50% before the end of 2024. Data on Wednesday showed Turkey\u2019s inflation slowed below 72% in June from a peak of over 75% the previous month.\n\nWith the outlook now in influx, central bank Governor Fatih Karahan downplayed the likelihood of rate cuts any time soon. In comments to Reuters published on Thursday, he said \u201cit is not healthy to draw conclusions from a single data point in this period of high volatility.\u201d\n\nReiterating his previous hawkish guidance, Karahan said \u201cwe will maintain tightness and wait for data and expectations to get in line with our disinflation path. We think we still have some way to go in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe central bank in June left rates unchanged for a third straight month, warning policy will be restrictive \u201cuntil a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend\u201d of monthly inflation.\n\nWhile the monthly gauge was at 1.6% in June, the lowest in over a year, Morgan Stanley pointed to \u201cstill-high services inflation\u201d and said \u201cadministered price hikes continue to keep upside risks alive.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Kerim Karakaya and Beril Akman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

This article highlights three companies \u2014 Cullen/Frost Bankers, Morgan Stanley, and Federal Agricultural Mortgage \u2014 that exemplify this stability and growth, offering solid yields alongside their long history of dividend increases.\n\nCullen/Frost Bankers\n\nCullen/Frost Bankers (NYSE:CFR) is a financial holding company offering commercial and consumer banking services, trust and investment management, insurance, brokerage, mutual funds, leasing, treasury management, capital markets advisory and item processing services across Texas, including Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Permian Basin, Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio.\n\nThe company has paid consistent dividends for 32 consecutive years and raised them for 31 consecutive years. Cullen/Frost pays a quarterly dividend of $0.92 per share, or $3.68 annualized. The annual yield on the dividend is 3.64%.\n\nOver the last 12 months, the company earned $1.93 billion in revenues and $556 million in net income.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a global investment bank with institutional securities, wealth management, and investment management segments. Approximately 45% of its net revenue comes from its institutional securities business, 45% from wealth management, and 10% from investment management.\n\nThe company has maintained consistent dividend payments for 32 years and raised them for 10 consecutive years.\n\nMorgan Stanley pays a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, or $3.40 annualized. The annual yield on the dividend currently stands at 3.41%.

Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley is to scrap the bonus cap for its London bankers in a post-Brexit shake-up that paves the way for multimillion-pound payouts to top performers.\n\nThe US firm has joined Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in replacing a European Union-mandated restriction \u2013 which limited bonuses for certain employees to two times their fixed pay \u2013 with a new \u201cappropriate internal bonus cap\u201d.\n\nBritain scrapped the cap last year in an attempt to revive the City and draw a distinction with Brussels.\n\nIt paves the way for star bankers to receive US-style payouts. Wall Street rainmakers typically get 10 or more times their salary in bonuses at top firms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s decision emerged in regulatory filings that were first reported by the Financial Times. The US bank said: \u201cWe continue to pay competitively and reward strong performance.\u201d\n\nGoldman is preparing to cut fixed pay in London while allowing bankers to earn up to 25 times their salary in bonuses. JP Morgan is said to allow bankers to make 10 times their salary. Citigroup is reportedly in the process of making similar changes as well.\n\nThe bonus cap was introduced by the EU in 2014 in an attempt to limit risk-taking after the financial crisis. Britain scrapped the banker bonus cap during Kwasi Kwarteng's short-lived tenure as chancellor - Simon Walker/HM Treasury\n\nBritain\u2019s subsequent decision to scrap it \u2013 a divergence only possible after Brexit \u2013 was taken under former prime minister Liz Truss and is one of the few changes to have survived her disastrous mini-Budget in September, which caused a market rout.\n\nAt the time, Ms Truss and her then chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, argued that the cap had become arbitrary, with banks finding other ways to remunerate top performers instead.\n\nThe new pay rules apply to so-called \u201cmaterial risk-takers\u201d, a special classification of bank staff who can pose a risk to the lender\u2019s financial stability.\n\nSalaries had been increased in the past few years to offset the bonus cap. But some bankers have been wary of giving up higher levels of fixed pay in exchange for variable bonus payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is because there is no guarantee they will receive the same amount per year, meaning mortgage agreements can prove harder to obtain and private school fees more difficult to pay.\n\nMr Kwarteng argued that abolishing the cap would make London more attractive to banks, helping the City compete with New York for talent.\n\nWall Street companies have often been wary about moving staff from New York to London, as bankers in the US typically receive less in salary and more in bonuses.\n\nThe bonus shake-up could also give London an edge over EU financial capitals such as Paris and Amsterdam, which are vying to win more financial markets business following Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\nSome European bank bosses have already complained that the rule changes will put them at a disadvantage to the UK.",

        "title": "Why DELL Stock Is One of the Best Ways to Play the AI Boom",
        "content": "With its huge opportunity in artificial intelligence, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is one of the best tech stocks investors can own.\n\nIn late May, DELL stock rallied to an all-time high of just under $180 per share on expectations that the company will see exponential growth from sales of its AI servers.\n\nBetween January and the start of June, the company\u2019s share price doubled. But over the past month, the stock has declined 16% after Dell\u2019s first-quarter earnings raised concerns about the profitability of the AI servers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors shouldn\u2019t fret. The pullback seen in recent weeks is likely to be a temporary reset before DELL stock again runs higher.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re still in the early innings of the AI revolution and that Dell should be a long-term beneficiary of the technology shift.\n\nAI Opportunity\n\nDell is expected to be a huge winner in the AI space. Currently, Dell is building and selling servers that use the newest Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI microchips, including the H100 GPU and the Blackwell-generation of chips.\n\nRecently, Elon Musk announced that Dell servers are being purchased to help run a supercomputer at his xAI startup company.\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has forecast $10 billion of AI server revenue from Dell in the company\u2019s current fiscal year that ends in February 2025.\n\nWith its most recent financial results, Dell reported that shipments of its AI-optimized servers rose more than 100% sequentially to $1.70 billion.\n\nDell said that the backlog of orders for its AI servers increased 30% during Q1 to $3.80 billion, and its AI server sales rose 42% to $5.50 billion as demand is strengthening.\n\nAnalysts believe concerns over Dell\u2019s AI servers selling at low margins are temporary.\n\nBeyond the servers, Dell\u2019s other business building personal computers and laptops is expected to get a boost in the coming years as new AI features lead to a refresh cycle for the entire PC industry.\n\nStock Upgrade\n\nIn mid-June, Morgan Stanley named Dell stock a \u201ctop pick\u201d and said the company\u2019s share price could rise 40% from current levels. The bullish outlook comes after analyst Erik Woodring met with Dell\u2019s management team at the company\u2019s Texas headquarters.\n\nWoodring came away from the meeting believing that Dell\u2019s momentum with AI servers should accelerate in coming quarters.\n\nHe reiterated an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on Dell stock and said the share price could reach $200 in coming months. He added in a note to clients that Dell\u2019s personal computer business is \u201cwell positioned to outperform the market\u201d with accelerating sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nHis note concluded: \u201cWe\u2019d take advantage of recent post-earnings underperformance to \u2018buy the dip\u2019 on a leading AI infrastructure player trading at a relative discount to peers.\u201d\n\nDividend Payments\n\nBeyond its share price appreciation, another reason to like Dell stock is its dividend. Last autumn, management at the company, led by founder Michael Dell, pledged to increase the quarterly distribution to stockholders by 10% a year between now and 2028.\n\nCompany executives added that they expect net income to convert to adjusted free cash flow at a rate of 100% or better moving forward.\n\nFurthermore, the company expects to return at least 80% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends, up from a previous commitment to return 50% to 60% of free cash flow.\n\nDell currently pays a quarterly dividend of 45 cents a share, giving it a yield of 1.28%. Besides steadily increasing its dividend payments, Dell also increased its stock buyback program by $5 billion.\n\nBuy Dell Stock\n\nWhat\u2019s not to like about Dell Technologies? The company has a massive opportunity in front of it with AI. Its core business of personal computers is headed for a global refresh cycle.\n\nAnalysts are pounding the table on the stock. And the company has committed to increasing dividends and share buybacks. With so many catalysts working in its favor, investors should take advantage of the current pullback and buy shares hand over fist. Dell stock is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Will Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH) Recover? My Thoughts as a Soft-Drink Business Owner",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has taken a hammering in recent months after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), quoting the latest Nielsen data, suggested that the growth-focused firm had lost market share. This has been compounded by additional data inferring that further incremental gains in the energy drinks market may be challenging. I\u2019m neutral on Celsius because despite liking the brand, the stock looks a little expensive to me.\n\nIs There a Market for Celsius?\n\nWhile I\u2019m actually a founder of my own health-focused soft drinks business, it\u2019s a million miles away from a company like Celsius. However, it\u2019s certainly interesting to see Celsius develop its niche and gain market share.\n\nCelsius positions itself as a healthier alternative to traditional soft drinks, offering beverages made with natural ingredients and caffeine sourced from nature. Emphasizing its commitment to healthy living, the company produces drinks without added sugars, aligning with current consumer trends.\n\nIn recent years, Celsius has capitalized on the growing demand for healthier beverage options. This is appealing to those seeking a more natural and refreshing way to stay energized and hydrated.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a caveat. Celsius replaces the sugar with things like the artificial sweetener sucralose. For context, when I made my health-focused soft drink \u2014 it\u2019s called Sumacqua \u2014 I decided I\u2019d rather have some sugar from natural sources like grape juice \u2014 which is high in polyphenols \u2014 rather than artificial ingredients.\n\nNonetheless, many people in the industry still see this as an improvement on traditional sugar-heavy canned drinks like cola, which are partially responsible for the widespread nature of diabetes. Celsius also claims to create metabolically positive drinks. These claims are only possible if you have the research to back it up.\n\nIn short, there appears to be great scope for growth. Celsius is operating in growing markets, with the healthy drinks market expected to grow from $344.36 billion in 2023 to $408.8 billion by 2028. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Celsius doesn\u2019t necessarily fall into this category; it is often referred to as an energy+ drink (an energy drink designed to boost metabolism and burn fat).\n\nData Turns on Celsius\n\nOn May 15, Morgan Stanley reported that Celsius saw a minor market share dip from 10.8% to 10.5% based on Nielsen data. In turn, this led to a swift sell-off and arguably one that was justified. At 100x earnings and 20x sales, the stock was priced for perfection. For context, I was told by private equity that if my business hit $1 million in sales in a year, it would be valued on a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of three to five.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Truist analyst Bill Chappell has suggested that while few companies make it above 10% market share, incremental gains from here on will be challenging. Chappell noted that further growth may necessitate converting loyal customers of Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Red Bull.\n\nWhat Do the Forecasts Say About Celsius?\n\nCelsius is expected to register earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 in 2024, and that then rises dramatically to $1.45 in 2025 and $1.99 in 2026. This is impressive growth for a company that\u2019s not operating in a fast-moving sector like technology or biotech. Looking beyond 2026, the number of analysts offering forecasts falls to just one. The singular analysts suggest that Celsius\u2019s EPS will rise to $4.84 by 2033.\n\nSo, what do these earnings projections mean for valuation metrics? Well, Celsius is currently trading at 51.69x non-GAAP forward earnings. This price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio then falls to 38.64x in 2025 and 28.07x in 2026. The TTM P/S ratio has fallen to 9.4x, and the forward ratio sits at 7.9x.\n\nAccording to the forecasts, earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of around 28.8% over the next five years. Given the 51.69x non-GAAP forward P/E, Celsius does look a little expensive. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 1.8x.\n\nIs Celsius Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CELH comes in as a Moderate Buy based on nine Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Celsius Holdings stock price target is $80.33, implying a 40.7% downside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Celsius Stock\n\nI like Celsius\u2019s brand, and I think they\u2019re taking the industry in the right direction. Very few companies have successfully taken on the soft drinks market with a healthier alternative to the legacy brands producing forms of lemonade and cola. However, I do wonder, as noted by Truist analyst Chappell, whether incremental gains will be harder to come by from here on.\n\nEqually, I believe the company is a little on the expensive side, even considering the strong earnings trajectory. This is highlighted by the PEG ratio of 1.8x. Personally, I\u2019m already over-invested in the sector, given my attempts to start my own soft drinks company. But if I weren\u2019t, I probably wouldn\u2019t be investing in Celsius. While it\u2019s a promising company, I\u2019m neutral on the stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The financial services sector in 2024 is poised for growth, driven by robust economic fundamentals and technological advancements. As one of the largest contributors to the U.S. economy, this sector generates significant revenue and employment. Key trends include a resurgence in traditional banking, boosted by rising interest rates and economic recovery, and a notable expansion in fintech. This forms the basis of my article for the best financial services stocks to buy.\n\nDigital innovations, such as blockchain and AI, are transforming financial services, enhancing efficiency and customer experience. Investors are particularly optimistic about companies that leverage these technologies for competitive advantage.\n\nThese are all blue-chip stocks that have great reputations, and I believe that investors will do well by adding them to their portfolios.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ten major US and European banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BNP Paribas SA, plan to pay a combined $46 million to end a lengthy legal battle with pension plans that accused them of conspiring to block competitors in interest-rate swaps trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks Supreme Court Blocks EPA \u2018Good Neighbor\u2019 Ozone Emission Rule\n\nThe payments are part of a deal to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought by investors more than eight years ago, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg. The settlement was filed Thursday in New York federal court, and plaintiffs have asked US District Judge Paul Oetken to preliminarily approve it.\n\nThe banks denied violating any laws and said they sought to avoid the cost of ongoing litigation. Plaintiffs asked the judge to approve the deal. Another bank, Credit Suisse Group AG, settled claims in the case two years ago by agreeing to pay $25 million. Credit Suisse is now owned by UBS Group AG, which was among the 10 involved in the latest settlement.\n\nThe case is part of a wave of litigation brought by public pension plans against big banks accused of colluding across various markets, including interbank rates, currencies and credit default swaps. The financial institutions have faced claims that they kept electronic trading platforms from entering those markets so they could control prices and boost profits.\n\nSome of the cases have led to substantial settlements and reforms. Last year, a platform used by banks in the market for stock lending agreed to make changes to \u201cmaterially decrease the likelihood of future collusion.\u201d Four banks paid almost $500 million to settle that case, but denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe swaps settlement comes after the judge in December denied class-action status to the claims. That essentially gutted the case because investors typically can\u2019t afford bringing lawsuits on their own, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts. Before that ruling, BI had predicted the 10 remaining banks would settle for a combined $170 million to $850 million, based on what Credit Suisse had paid.\n\nThe other defendants in the case are Bank of America Corp., Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and NatWest Group.\n\nPension plans and other investors claimed the banks overcharged for interest-rate swaps because of their tight control over an antiquated over-the-counter market, where dealers priced and traded swaps directly with investors outside of centralized exchanges. According to the suit, Wall Street firms prevented the investors from using electronic platforms, which are more transparent, faster and offer better prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors, including pension plans, university endowments and hedge funds, typically use the swaps to hedge against changes to monetary policy when central banks raise or lower interest rates.\n\nThe banks argued that investors weren\u2019t harmed because data shows that a large number of relevant trades didn\u2019t make any money or resulted in a loss. The plaintiffs disputed that any below-zero trades occurred. But the judge, in refusing to grant class-action status, said the \u201cplaintiffs failed to persuasively rebut defendants\u2019 strong showing that there were numerous at-or-below-zero trades during the class period.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the banks prevented the trading of interest rate swaps on services provided by Bloomberg.\n\nThe case is In re: Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litigation, 1:16-md-02704, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Foley Square)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Stock Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to enjoy a solid run as the improving macro environment, coupled with the AI optimism and recent stock upgrades, provides solid support for risk assets.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600, up from the previous target of 5,200.\n\nThis revision by one of the most important financial institutions is attributed to robust earnings growth from five major U.S. technology companies and a higher projected fair value price-to-earnings ratio multiple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have seen a combined surge of 45%, now representing 25% of the S&P 500\u2019s equity capitalization.\n\nGoldman points to upward adjustments in the 2024 earnings estimates for these tech companies and valuation increases driven by growing investor excitement around artificial intelligence. The broker anticipates that stable real yields by the end of the year and strong earnings performance will justify a 15x P/E ratio for the equal-weight S&P 500 Index.\n\nHowever, the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November poses a significant risk to the S&P 500\u2019s levels, as historically, index volatility has increased leading up to the election. Post-election, the trend typically reverses, with the index recovering to higher levels.\n\nThe news that Goldman lifted its target came as Evercore ISI also revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 on Sunday, setting it to Street-high 6,000, up from 4,750. The firm expects an 8% earnings growth in 2023, bolstered by the potential of the AI \u201crevolution.\u201d\n\nAs valuation models are refreshed to account for higher multiples, we look at 3 hottest stock upgrades from last week.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. Known for its innovative products and strong brand, Nike consistently delivers strong financial performance and growth potential, making it a solid investment choice.\n\nOppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) upgraded its rating for Nike, shifting from a neutral \u201cPerform\u201d stance to a more bullish \u201cOutperform.\u201d Alongside the stock upgrades, the firm also increased its price target for the sportswear giant\u2019s shares from $110.00 to $120.00.\n\nThe stock upgrades come after a period when Nike faced a series of challenges that impacted its sales growth and profit margins. According to Oppenheimer, these difficulties included a mix of external and internal factors that have now been largely accounted for in the company\u2019s current stock price and financial projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the current market valuation of Nike\u2019s shares and the short-term financial expectations have become \u201cderisked.\u201d This term indicates that the risks previously associated with Nike\u2019s performance are now reflected in its stock price, setting a stage for potential recovery.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is a leading retailer of electronics, appliances and tech services. With a broad product range and strong market presence, it attracts investors seeking exposure to consumer electronics and retail sectors.\n\nRecently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) upgraded shares of Best Buy, moving the rating from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cBuy.\u201d Accompanying the stock upgrades, the firm also increased the price target for the retailer\u2019s stock to $106 from the previous $85. The stock upgrades come with a positive outlook from UBS on Best Buy\u2019s potential performance over the next 18 months.\n\nUBS identified several factors that could drive the company\u2019s sales upward. These include an anticipated improvement in housing trends, which typically correlate with appliance sales, and a pending electronics replacement cycle that occurs every four to seven years.\n\nMoreover, the firm expects product innovation, particularly involving artificial intelligence, to boost sales by an average of approximately 200 basis points.\n\nFurthermore, UBS highlighted Best Buy\u2019s expansion into new product categories, such as e-bikes and furniture, as a potential growth avenue. The firm predicts that these elements combined could lead to a robust recovery in Best Buy\u2019s sales in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nAlcoa (AA) alcola stock\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is a major producer of aluminum, known for its mining, refining and smelting operations. Its position in the industrial metals sector and focus on sustainability make it an appealing investment for those interested in materials and infrastructure growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) revisited its recommendations on mining companies, lifting ratings on Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Analysts upgraded Alcoa from \u201cEqual Weight\u201d to \u201cOverweight,\u201d setting a new price target of $50.00, up from the previous $36.50.\n\nThe stock upgrades come against the backdrop of disruptions in the global alumina supply, which are expected to keep prices elevated. The broker pointed out that approximately 5.9 million tonnes of alumina capacity disruptions have occurred, accounting for about 10% of the global supply outside of China.\n\nThese disruptions, coupled with China\u2019s increased need to import alumina, are anticipated to tighten the global supply and sustain higher alumina prices than historical averages, potentially reaching $500 in the second half of 2024 and $385 in 2025.\n\nThe situation is also expected to constrain China\u2019s aluminum production, despite the country\u2019s plans to restart some operations. Morgan Stanley\u2019s projections suggest aluminum prices could be supported at $1.22 in the latter half of 2024 and $1.12 in 2025. This outlook appears to be a driving factor behind the positive sentiment on Alcoa\u2019s stock.\n\nAdditionally, Freeport-McMoRan received an upgrade from \u201cEqual Weight\u201d to \u201cOverweight,\u201d with the price target being lifted to $62.00 from the former $49.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The 31 large US banks that participated in a Federal Reserve stress test would all be able to withstand a severe global recession, a new demonstration of strength as they push back on stricter regulations that would require them to hold more capital.\n\nResults released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending during a two-year scenario where US unemployment climbs to 10%, commercial real estate prices fall 40% and the stock market plunges 55%.\n\nTheir losses in this simulation collectively amounted to $685 billion. That included $175 billion from credit cards, $142 billion from business loans, and nearly $80 billion from commercial real estate.\n\nThe biggest of the group \u2014 JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2014 would all have capital buffers close to double the Fed\u2019s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.\n\nLarger regional banks such as PNC (PNC) and Truist (TFC), Regions (RF), Citizens (CFG) and M&T Bank (MTB) also had relatively higher capital levels than the minimum.\n\nOne regional bank that has struggled this year, New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), was not part of the latest test. It will instead be examined in 2025.\n\n\"The goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario,\" Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr said in a release. \u201cThis test shows that they do.\u201d Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBut there were signs of some new weaknesses despite the passing grade applied to all banks.\n\nThe aggregate decline in capital ratios for the banks during a hypothetical downturn was larger than the decline posted by banks in last year\u2019s test, when fewer lenders were examined.\n\n\"The test resulted in higher losses because bank balance sheets are somewhat riskier and expenses are higher,\" Barr added.\n\nHe cited three main factors driving the capital decline: \"substantial\" increases in bank credit card balances, riskier corporate credit portfolios, and less projected income due to higher expenses and lower fee revenue.\n\nResults varied widely between banks. The bank with the highest rate of loan losses under the Fed\u2019s \"severely adverse scenario\" was Discover (DFS), followed by Capital One (COF).\n\nCapital One agreed earlier this year to purchase Discover in a deal that still needs regulatory approval to close.\n\nThe bank with the lowest rate of loan losses was Charles Schwab (SCHW). Capital One headquarters in McLean, Va. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in the aftermath of the last financial crisis. It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010.\n\nStory continues\n\nA law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks\u2019 size, meaning those in the range of $100 billion-$250 billion would be tested every other year.\n\nSome Democrats and regulators last year were critical of that 2018 adjustment. They argued it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not been subjected to a stress test before it failed in 2023.\n\nBanks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks.\n\nSome banks are expected to make announcements late Friday about how much money they now plan to return to shareholders.\n\nAny moves are \"likely to be modest for many\" until lenders get more clarity from regulators about a new set of capital requirements proposed last year, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy.\n\nThe initial version called for raising capital levels an aggregate 16% and banks have spent the last year pushing back aggressively on the plan.\n\nRegulators have signaled that alterations are coming, with Barr saying in May that he expects \"broad and material changes\" to the proposal.\n\nBloomberg reported this week that a new proposal could drop the capital hikes as low as 5%.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now",
        "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 4.88% so far this year. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.85 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.48% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.91% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.6%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.33%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nLooking at this fiscal year, MS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.82 per share, with earnings expected to increase 24.91% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Machine learning stocks are doing well in 2024, led by the astronomical 145% growth ofNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but there are other opportunities to explore apart from Nvidia in the machine-learning market, with a potential size of $79.3 billion in 2024 and 36% growth between 2024 and 2030, reaching $503.4 billion by 2030.\n\nNorth America is the biggest market for machine learning, thanks in part to the country\u2019s favorable policy trends. The 2023 National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan stresses working together across sectors, and, in the meantime, President Biden is still issuing executive orders about AI and machine learning to maintain America\u2019s lead.\n\nHowever, because the market for machine learning stocks is still fairly new, buyers usually rush to Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), making machine learning stocks trading at a discount more valuable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, inflation numbers consistently above a 2% target show that the economy is still not out of the woods, so the Fed will only cut interest rates once this year.\n\nWhen the economy isuncertain, as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Mogan Stanley (NYSE:MS) insist, it\u2019s best to invest in companies that are getting good reviews from analysts and are selling for less than what they\u2019re worth historically.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) holds a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating, with an average price target of approximately $865, indicating a potential upside of roughly 15% from its current price of $749.\n\nNOW\u2019s new AI tools and strong growth in membership sales show that it strategically focuses on adding machine learning to its services, making NOW one of the best stocks in the space.\n\n\u200bServiceNow used Knowledge 2024 as a launch pad for several new machine-learning products that will integrate corporate processes and enhance user experiences.\n\nEven if you put its machine learning ambitions to one side, you\u2019re dealing with a very strong stock in the shape of NOW; this quality pick among machine learning stocks is on a winning streak, surpassing analyst expectations in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.\n\nServiceNow\u2019s latest first-quarter 2024 results once again affirm its strong standing in the industry. With an EPS figure of $3.41, besting estimates of $3.14 and $2.60 billion in sales outpacing analyst projections with $2.59 billion, analysts expect the ServiceNow growth story to continue, projecting EPS to increase 118% in fiscal 2024 and 28% in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares have dropped 10% in six months because of a bad forecast for fiscal Q2. This is the biggest drop in one day since September 2022.\n\nWith 26 experts giving Adobe a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating and predicting a 16% rise from $533 to $617, the company\u2019s stock price drop presents a unique chance for machine learning companies that aren\u2019t following the crowd.\n\nAs part of its work on machine learning, Adobe is increasingly using creative AI. The AI-powered Adobe Lightroom Generative Elimination feature removes unnecessary elements from photos.\n\nCreative AI in Adobe Premiere Pro also lets users stretch shots, add or remove items, and make films inspired by text. AI models OpenAI and Runway are being added to Adobe to make updating more powerful and open.\n\nAcrobat and Reader also let you connect with the AI Assistant through PDFs. The AI Assistant takes complicated words and turns them into facts and insights.\n\nEven though the outlook isn\u2019t good, Adobe still expects fiscal year 2024 sales to rise 10.4% to $21.42 billion and EPS to rise 11.8% to $17.96 per share.\n\nAdobe doesn\u2019t give out dividends, but the company\u2019s board just passed a plan to buy back $25 billion worth of stock.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAce investor Louis Navellier says Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the most underestimated of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. Despite a 29% rise this year, the stock has over 10% upside and a \u201cstrong buy\u201d consensus rating, making it the safest machine learning investment.\n\nGoogle Research advances NLP, computer vision and reinforcement learning. BERT has raised search query word context understanding standards, improving search accuracy and user experience. TensorFlow and AutoML on the company\u2019s cloud help businesses develop bespoke models.\n\nMachine learning aids Alphabet\u2019s Jigsaw team in internet toxicity prevention. Perspective, trained on hundreds of poisonous comments, discovers and censors dangerous material, strengthening user confidence and saving Alphabet money on legal fees.\n\nDespite its machine learning worries, Alphabet\u2019s outstanding financial performance, including a 15% increase in sales revenue to $80.5 billion, will likely please investors. Investors also favor this IT powerhouse among machine learning stocks due to its first dividend and $70 billion share buyback program.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

Prosecutors had asked that the former hedge fund manager be sentenced to two years behind bars to deter others from similar conduct.\n\nLawyers for Phillips argued that prison was unnecessary because he had been punished enough by the destruction of his career, the downfall of his hedge fund and his stay in a Spanish jail following his arrest.\n\nAddressing the judge before his sentencing, Phillips said the case had been \u201can incredibly difficult experience\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t wish \u201con anyone, even my worst enemy.\u201d\n\nThough he avoided prison, the sentence capped the fall from grace of Phillips, previously celebrated as a canny and aggressive trader.

        "content": "There\u2019s more to the current rally in technology stocks than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidia stock continues to get the lion\u2019s share of attention from the financial press. However, there are a number of other tech stocks to buy that are posting impressive gains and have exciting things happening at their underlying companies.\n\nEqually important, there are a number of tech stocks to buy now to play the booming artificial intelligence (AI) trade. Despite how it might appear reading the news these days, Nvidia is not the only stock to buy to capitalize on the boom in AI and rising demand for the components that power AI applications and models.\n\nInvestors willing to cast a wide net can find plenty of great tech stocks to invest in currently. Here are three tech stock giants to load up on now: June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) looks like a good bet, but don\u2019t take our word for it. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is pounding the table on DELL stock after meeting with management. Morgan Stanley has named Dell a \u201ctop pick\u201d and says the company\u2019s share price could rally as much as 40% from current levels. Morgan Stanley encourages investors to capitalize on Dell stock\u2019s pullback after reporting financial results at the end of May.\n\nThat pullback looks like it might now be over. In the past week, Dell\u2019s shares have gained nearly 10% on reports of not only the Morgan Stanley recommendation but also news that the company is building servers to run AI chips for xAI, the start-up company being run by Elon Musk. DELL stock had fallen throughout June on concerns about the profitability of the company\u2019s emerging AI server business. The company has now alleviated those concerns.\n\nDell stock is up 183% over the past 12 months and there are rumors that it may soon be added to the S&P 500 index. Dell is the biggest stock by market capitalization that\u2019s currently not in the benchmark index.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of stocks being added to new indices, British chipmaker Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing floundering satellite radio provider Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI). The change occurred on June 24 and is part of a quarterly rebalancing, said Nasdaq in a news release. The Nasdaq 100, which is comprised of the 100 largest stocks from the broader Nasdaq Composite index, is rebalanced quarterly and factors in market capitalization and stock performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nArm Holdings currently has a market capitalization of $168 billion and its share price is up 164% since the company went public in September 2023. In comparison, Sirius XM\u2019s market cap stands at $11 billion. Its stock is down nearly 50% so far in 2024 and trading at less than $3 per share, making it a penny stock. ARM stock is expected to benefit from inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will now buy its shares, giving them a boost.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother chipmaker that looks to have wind in its sails is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The company\u2019s stock has been on a tear ever since reporting better-than-expected financial results and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Broadcom\u2019s stock popped 12% after the company said that its shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis July 15. The split will lower the stock price from about $1,660 currently to $166, making them more accessible to retail investors.\n\nNews of the stock split was accompanied by financial results that showed Broadcom is benefitting from red hot demand for AI microchips and processors. The company reported first-quarter EPS of $10.96 versus analysts expectations of $10.84. Revenue totaled $12.49 billion, exceeding the forecasted $12.03 billion. Management said its AI products generated more than $3 billion in Q1 sales. AVGO stock has nearly doubled in the last 12 months.\n\nAnalysts like the stock heading into the split. The consensus view among 23 Wall Street analysts is that AVGO stock is a strong buy, with a median price target that is 15% higher than current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

Investors include endowments, foundations, family offices, bank wealth platforms and sovereign wealth funds.\n\nThe premiere caps a busy year for Jain \u2014 former co-chief investment officer at Millennium Management \u2014 who has traveled the world pitching his fund. He initially aimed to gather as much as $10 billion. But after struggling to hit that goal, he cut client fees to entice investors and reduced his target to between $5 billion and $6 billion.\n\nA representative for the firm declined to comment.\n\nEven with the revised goal, Jain Global is the biggest launch since 2018. Jain topped fellow Millennium alumnus Diego Megia, whose Taula Capital Management began trading this month with $5 billion. Megia spun out his macro pod from Millennium and received $3 billion from his former employer.\n\nJain has been raising money in a challenging environment, as interest rates remain elevated and deals have slowed to a trickle. New hedge funds also face stiff competition from bigger multistrategy funds with established track records.\n\nDespite those obstacles, Jain Global is starting off big \u2014 having hired 215 people, including 42 portfolio managers. The firm has seven businesses that will go live on July 1, including an Asia-Pacific business that will essentially act as a multimanager platform and trade six strategies, with the profits feeding into the Jain fund.\n\nThe firm raised money via a so-called drawdown fund, meaning it will tap the cash as needed over a year.\n\nMichael Gelband\u2019s ExodusPoint still enjoys the distinction of biggest-ever hedge fund debut. Yet another Millennium alumnus, Gelband raised $8 billion for a multistrategy fund that began in 2018 and has fixed-income and equity businesses.\n\nJain launched his own shop after leaving Millennium, where he shared the CIO title with founder Izzy Englander. Over his seven years there, he helped the multistrategy giant push into new strategies, recruit, upgrade technologies and develop its central risk book. Millennium\u2019s assets doubled to about $60 billion during his tenure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrior to Millennium, Jain spent more than two decades at Credit Suisse Group AG, where he held many senior titles including head of global proprietary trading and global head of asset management.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley at Work Insights Spotlight Increasing Focus on Workplace Financial Benefits, With Equity Compensation Key",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley at Work concluded marquee workplace financial benefits industry event, Thrive, with largest attendance numbers to date Key takeaways show organizations placing greater value on comprehensive financial benefits, including equity solutions Voice of the Participant 2024 survey confirms equity compensation remains key driver of loyalty despite knowledge gaps\n\nNEW YORK, June 24, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley at Work today announced takeaways from its annual Thrive conference and Voice of the Participant survey, which together demonstrate increasing demand for and adoption of workplace financial benefits among both companies and their employees. Findings show equity plans in particular continue to gain popularity as a strategic method to attract, retain and motivate top talent.\n\nUnderscoring this trend, the largest-ever 2024 Thrive conference in Phoenix, Arizona, saw record attendance from 1,000+ benefits professionals across public, private, U.S., and Canadian markets. Attendees came from a variety of sectors including Information, Health, Energy, Finance and more. Thought leaders presented topics ranging from financial reporting and automation to non-qualified deferred compensation and donor advised funds, while attendees enjoyed the option to earn continuing education credits at 85% of sessions, witness platform demonstrations, participate in hands-on labs, and access 11 invited industry partner exhibitors.\n\nThe conference also introduced a new charitable giving activity, Thrive Gives Back, where attendees hand-crafted over 200 backpacks and reading supplies for donation to local charity HandsOn Greater Phoenix\u2019s Reading Rocks program, which alongside other initiatives provides assistance to regional children in transitional and foster care.\n\nFor Thrive highlights, watch here.\n\nWithin this widening ecosystem of benefits solutions, research from Morgan Stanley at Work found more companies are offering some form of equity compensation benefits (76%, up 12% since 2021)1 as employee attitudes continue to evolve. Insights from the 2024 Voice of the Participant study, which expanded to a base of 2.3 million global stock plan participants at both private and public companies, reveal:\n\nEquity benefits and education drive employee satisfaction and retention: Stock plan benefits are highly sought-after, with 43% of participants saying equity was a reason they joined their company, and once participating, most (76%) stock plan participants are highly satisfied. What\u2019s more, over half (56%) of stock plan participants cite equity benefits as a reason they continue to work for their company, and seven in 10 say equity benefits are important for recognizing their accomplishments at work\u2014underlining how stock plans can contribute to retention as well as a culture of ownership. Yet U.S. participants seek plan education: 61% of U.S. stock plan participants say they do not understand how to try to maximize the financial benefit from their stock plan, showcasing the need for more comprehensive financial education support. Most U.S. participants say they would be likely to attend sessions on the topics of equity fundamentals (69%), retirement (67%), and advanced investing (64%).2 Taxes remain a bottleneck: While employees highly value their equity compensation, many still do not understand more nuanced aspects such as taxes. In fact, 62% of stock plan participants say they do not understand the impact of taxes on their stock plan benefit\u2014which can erode the net value of their holdings. Companies can close gaps and add value through guidance: Fewer than half of stock plan participants (45%) say they know how to reach someone if they have questions, and less than a third (31%) said they have a personal financial plan in place. This indicates an opportunity to invest in greater employee awareness and expand access to education, support, and guidance to help employees connect their equity to personal financial goals.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen a consistent story in the data over the years: Equity benefits can help drive real outcomes both for companies and their employees, and have taken on a starring role in company culture,\" said Scott Whatley, Head of Morgan Stanley at Work. \"That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to strike the right balance between digital tools and human guidance, and why we have been working hand in hand with our clients to create bespoke solutions that help deliver education and guidance throughout their participant ranks\u2014rising to meet the unique needs of increasingly diverse and global participant populations.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley at Work serves over 24,000 corporate clients and ~12M workplace participants, encompassing over 40% of the S&P 500 and roughly 60% of the Nasdaq 100.3 As announced at Thrive, the Firm delivered over 1,300 education sessions to more than 125,000 benefits participants around the world in 2023, and is continuing to roll out tech enhancements and updates\u2014such as expanding application programming interface (API) integration with leading real-time compensation benchmarking and planning solutions provider Pave to Equity Edge Online\u00ae. The business remains focused on delivering a more unified client experience while also bolstering service levels and staffing for deeper client and participant support.\n\n\"As economic headwinds and tailwinds shift, organizations and their employees continue to tell us that workplace financial benefits are both a strategic priority and an effective tool for pursuing goals, driving results, and remaining competitive,\" said Brian McDonald, Head of Institutional and Direct Businesses, Morgan Stanley. \"Putting clients first is one of Morgan Stanley\u2019s core values, and for us that means an ongoing commitment to invest in and deliver our full ecosystem of solutions for comprehensive support at every stage of our clients\u2019 corporate and individual financial journeys.\"\n\nTo learn more about Thrive go here.\n\nAdditional findings from the Third Annual Morgan Stanley at Work Stock Plan Participant study are available here.\n\nState of the Workplace Study 2024 | Morgan Stanley at Work Non-U.S. participants excluded from participant education plan numbers.

        "title": "Riot Requisitions Special Meeting of Bitfarms Shareholders and Nominates Three Highly Qualified, Independent Directors to Bring Urgently Needed Change to Bitfarms Board",
        "content": "New Independent Directors Are Necessary to Fix Bitfarms\u2019 Broken Corporate Governance and to Oversee a Fair Strategic Alternatives Process\n\nRiot Urges the Bitfarms Board to Ensure Shareholders Are Heard by Holding the Special Meeting Without Delay\n\nRiot Withdraws Previous Proposal to Acquire Bitfarms for US$2.30 Per Share; Stands Ready to Engage with Reconstituted Bitfarms Board Regarding a Potential Transaction\n\nCASTLE ROCK, Colo., June 24, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (\"Riot\") today announced that it has requisitioned a special meeting of Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) (\"Bitfarms\" or the \"Company\") shareholders (the \"Special Meeting\") to reconstitute the Bitfarms Board of Directors (the \"Bitfarms Board\"). Riot currently owns approximately 14.9% of Bitfarms, making it Bitfarms\u2019 largest shareholder.\n\nThe Special Meeting will give Bitfarms shareholders the opportunity to vote on the removal of Bitfarms Chairman and Interim CEO Nicolas Bonta and director Andr\u00e9s Finkielsztain (or their replacements), and any individual who fills the current vacancy created by the resignation of co-founder Emiliano Grodzki, who was voted off the Bitfarms Board at the Company\u2019s most recent Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders. Riot believes that Messrs. Bonta and Finkielsztain bear direct responsibility for the Bitfarms Board\u2019s poor corporate governance practices and consistent inability to realize Bitfarms\u2019 full potential. Riot will also seek to remove any additional director appointed by the Bitfarms Board after the date of this press release.\n\nTo replace these individuals, Riot has nominated three exceptional candidates: John Delaney, Amy Freedman and Ralph Goehring (the \"Nominees\"). Each of the Nominees is independent of Riot and Bitfarms and is ideally qualified to help restore shareholders\u2019 confidence in the Bitfarms Board. Together, the Nominees will bring needed independence and corporate governance credentials to the Bitfarms Board, as well as relevant experience overseeing significant corporate transactions and serving in executive management and public company director roles.\n\nThe bottom line is this: over the course of more than a year of attempting to engage constructively with the Bitfarms Board regarding a potential combination of Bitfarms and Riot, it has become evident to Riot that good faith negotiations simply will not be possible until there is real change in the Bitfarms boardroom. The culture of the current Bitfarms Board is founder-driven, and Riot believes it prioritizes the interests of individual directors over what is best for Bitfarms and its shareholders. The strategic review initiated by the Bitfarms Board was a reaction to the public pressure Riot has placed on the Bitfarms Board and does not address the core issue: until Bitfarms shareholders can truly have their voices heard and fresh perspectives are considered, the fundamental and deep-seated problems that have plagued the Company will continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Board Change Is Needed Now at Bitfarms\n\nShareholders should consider the following:\n\nBitfarms once again botched its CEO succession process \u2013 Bitfarms announced in March that it planned to seek a replacement for its CEO and President at the time, Geoffrey Morphy, but that he would lead Bitfarms until a replacement could be identified. Then, on May 13, Bitfarms abruptly announced Mr. Morphy had been terminated immediately after he filed a $27 million lawsuit against Bitfarms. The sudden termination of the Bitfarms CEO without a transition plan in place at a crucial period of execution for Bitfarms and the industry, as well as the lawsuit allegations \u2013 which, if accurate, raise serious questions about whether certain directors are committed to acting in the best interests of all Bitfarms shareholders \u2013 represent a dangerous failure of leadership by the current Bitfarms Board.\r\n\r\nThis was not an isolated occurrence: Mr. Morphy was the fourth Bitfarms CEO in five years. The ability to effectively identify, recruit and oversee a CEO is a fundamental duty of a board, and is essential to a well-functioning company\u2019s performance. The persistent and inarguable inability of the Bitfarms Board to adequately manage CEO succession is a clear indication that change is needed, and, as longtime directors, Messrs. Bonta and Finkielsztain bear direct responsibility.\n\nBitfarms\u2019 Board has been unwilling to engage constructively with Riot \u2013 Following approximately 13 months of attempting to meaningfully engage with Bitfarms regarding a potential combination of Bitfarms and Riot, Riot delivered a private acquisition proposal to the Bitfarms Board on April 22, 2024. After providing no constructive response, despite repeated follow up by Riot, the Bitfarms Board demanded that Riot sign a confidentiality agreement that included an excessive and off-market standstill of more than three years and, soon after, advised that the offer was too low, without any guidance as to what terms it would consider acceptable, or any other commentary.\r\n\r\nSince then, Riot has made multiple attempts to work constructively with Bitfarms toward a mutually beneficial combination \u2013 including sending several private letters to the Bitfarms Board proposing paths forward. Instead of engaging in good faith, Bitfarms has responded by implementing a shareholder rights plan \u2013 or \"poison pill\" \u2013 with a 15% trigger that is well below the customary 20% threshold. The 15% trigger is in direct conflict with established legal and governance standards, including those published by leading proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co. Bitfarms\u2019 poison pill sets a dangerous precedent for Canadian boards seeking to protect their positions at the expense of shareholders, and Riot will be applying to the Ontario Capital Markets Tribunal to cease-trade the poison pill.\r\n\r\nBitfarms has also made unwarranted and highly negative attacks against Riot and sought to falsely call into question Riot\u2019s intentions and objectives. Even after the adoption of the off-market poison pill, Riot offered the Bitfarms Board an opportunity to avoid the Special Meeting by jointly refreshing the Bitfarms Board. Bitfarms rejected this olive branch. This pattern of behavior reinforces the entrenched mentality of the current Bitfarms Board and its unwillingness to act in the best interests of all Bitfarms shareholders.\n\nBitfarms shareholders have lost confidence in their Board \u2013 At Bitfarms\u2019 Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders held on May 31, 2024, Bitfarms shareholders voted by a significant margin not to re-elect director and co-founder Emiliano Grodzki to the Bitfarms Board. Further, since Riot made its proposal public on May 28, Riot has been contacted by numerous Bitfarms shareholders who have conveyed support for fully exploring a combination between Riot and Bitfarms. These shareholders have also expressed a lack of confidence in the ability of the current Bitfarms Board to properly oversee a strategic alternatives process, successfully set and guide Bitfarms\u2019 priorities moving forward and, ultimately, act in the best interests of Bitfarms and all of its shareholders.\r\n\r\nRiot is asking that Bitfarms let the views of its shareholders be heard. Based on the response to Riot\u2019s public statements on Bitfarms, Riot is confident it is not alone in believing that Bitfarms\u2019 corporate governance is broken, and that the status quo cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nRiot\u2019s Director Nominees Are Independent, Highly Qualified and Ready to Serve\n\nIt is clear that directors with fresh perspectives are needed to address the issues in the Bitfarms boardroom. Riot is proposing three highly qualified individuals, each of whom is completely independent of Riot and Bitfarms. None of these nominees is receiving any compensation or other financial benefit from Riot or any of Riot\u2019s advisors, either directly or indirectly, related to Riot\u2019s requisition of the Special Meeting or in connection with serving as a nominee or director of Bitfarms. Together, they will bring much needed corporate governance oversight, transaction experience and business expertise to the Bitfarms Board:\n\nJohn Delaney, a government and public affairs expert with experience in the public and private sectors who currently serves as President of Flagler College, Of Counsel at government relations firm The Fiorentino Group and Of Counsel at law firm Rogers Towers P.A. Previously, he served in numerous political roles, including as the Mayor of Jacksonville \u2013 the 12th largest city by population in the United States. John currently serves as a director on the board of privately-held Main Street America Insurance (formerly The Main Street America Group), and previously was on the boards of Jacksonville Bancorp, Inc. (formerly Nasdaq: JAXB) and Florida Rock Industries, Inc. (formerly NYSE: FRK) \u2013 both of which were successfully acquired. John will bring decades of public policy and government relations knowledge, which is critical to the Bitcoin mining industry going forward, as well as crucial hands-on experience overseeing successful sale processes as a public company director.\n\nAmy Freedman, a corporate governance and public capital markets expert with over 25 years of experience. She is currently an advisor to Ewing Morris and Co. Investment Partners and to Longacre Square Partners. Prior to serving as an advisor to Ewing Morris, Ms. Freedman was a Partner and Head of Engagement Fund Investing at Ewing Morris. Previously, she was CEO of Kingsdale Advisors, a leading shareholder services and advisory firm, and spent over 15 years in capital markets as an investment banker with global firms including Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE: SF) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS). Ms. Freedman is currently a director on the boards of Mandalay Resources Corporation (TSX: MND, OTCQB: MNDJF), Irish Residential Properties REIT plc (ISE: IRES) and American Hotel Income Properties REIT (TSX: HOT.UN, HOT.U). Ms. Freedman is also currently a director of Canaccord Genuity (TSX: CF), but her tenure on the board of Canaccord Genuity will end on August 9, 2024, as she is not standing for re-election. She formerly served on the board of Park Lawn Corporation (TSX: PLC, PLC.U). Amy will bring decades of experience helping boards improve corporate governance and evaluate complex M&A transactions and possesses a unique perspective from having served as both a public company advisor and director.\n\nRalph Goehring, a financial and energy expert with extensive experience serving as a public company CFO. Ralph is currently a Business Consultant to Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: GCEH), where he previously served as CFO, and is also the founder and CEO of SandDollar Financial, LLC, an accounting firm that provides outsourced accounting and CFO services. Formerly, he was the CFO of both Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. and Berry Petroleum Company. Ralph is currently President and CEO, and a board member, of privately-held Black Horse Resources, and previously served on the board of Strathmore Minerals Corp. (formerly TSX: STM), which was successfully sold. Ralph will bring relevant energy industry and executive leadership experience, as well as extensive public company financial, accounting and tax expertise \u2013 which is integral to any potential M&A process.\n\nTogether, these three individuals possess the right fit-for-purpose skillsets and experience to be able to objectively help oversee the strategic alternatives process at Bitfarms \u2013 as well as to help guide Bitfarms forward if the Bitfarms Board ultimately determines that is the optimal direction for all Bitfarms shareholders.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe Bitfarms Board should demonstrate respect for the rights of its shareholders by holding the Special Meeting without delay. Any gamesmanship or tactics to avoid calling the Special Meeting as soon as possible will only be further evidence of entrenchment and a disregard for the will of Bitfarms\u2019 shareholders.\n\nRiot continues to believe that a combination of Bitfarms and Riot will create the premier and largest publicly listed Bitcoin miner globally, with geographically diversified operations well-positioned for long-term growth. Riot remains completely committed to pursuing a transaction with Bitfarms. However, it is clear that engaging with the incumbent Bitfarms Board on a potential combination is just not possible. As a result, Riot has informed the Bitfarms Board that it has formally withdrawn its previous proposal to acquire all Bitfarms common shares at a price of US$2.30 per share and stands ready to engage and negotiate with a reconstituted Bitfarms Board to pursue a mutually beneficial combination of Bitfarms and Riot.\n\nCanadian Early Warning Disclosure\n\nRiot includes the following disclosure pursuant to Part 3 of Canadian National Instrument 62-103 \u2013 The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues and Part 5 of Canadian National Instrument 62-104 \u2013 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids in respect of Bitfarms.\n\nRiot\u2019s early warning report dated June 13, 2024 disclosed that Riot beneficially owned 57,627,036 common shares in Bitfarms (the \"Common Shares\"), representing approximately 14.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares as of June 13, 2024 (as calculated based on the information most recently provided by Bitfarms in its material change report dated June 10, 2024).

        "content": "Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (MSDL) shares rallied 5.4% in the last trading session to close at $24.13. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 3% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve expected to cut the rate once later this year, the financial services companies are in the spotlight. Hence, Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund is likely to see an increase in demand for loans from its portfolio companies and new entities as they realize higher rates are here to stay for longer. Thus, this drove the MSDL stock higher.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6%. Revenues are expected to be $101.6 million, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on MSDL going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "By Anton Bridge\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's banking regulator on Monday ordered the banking and securities units of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to improve compliance measures after the securities watchdog found multiple breaches of \"firewall\" regulations.\n\nThe penalties come less than two years after the securities arm of rival megabank Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group was indicted on market manipulation charges, for which it was ordered to halt the offending business line and improve compliance.\n\nThe Financial Services Agency, which hands out such penalties, ordered each of the MUFG units to establish the causes of the breaches and submit business improvement plans to prevent recurrences.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission recommended in mid-June that MUFG Bank and the group's two securities tie-ups with Morgan Stanley be penalised for the unauthorised sharing of client information.\n\nIts investigation found at least 26 occasions where confidential information had been shared between MUFG Bank and one of the group's two securities firms - Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.\n\nIt also found that MUFG Bank had offered preferential lending rates to clients that did business with the two securities brokerages.\n\nJapan's \"firewall\" regulations prohibit banks and securities companies in the same group from sharing customer data with one another without the customer's consent.\n\nMUFG said in a statement that it fully accepted the penalties and planned to submit the business improvement plans to the FSA.\n\n(Reporting by Anton Bridge; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Lincoln Feast and Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tesla Stock (NASDAQ:TSLA): 2 Catalysts That Indicate a Turnaround",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has performed poorly over the past 12 months due to several factors, ranging from strong competition in the EV space to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s distractions from the company, all exacerbated by valuation concerns. However, I believe two short-term catalysts could indicate that Tesla has hit bottom, so I am bullish on the company\u2019s turnaround prospects today.\n\nIn this article,\u00a0I will detail these catalysts and explain why they may justify the company\u2019s current premium valuation.\n\nThe Robotaxi Potential\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s shareholder meeting, Elon Musk elaborated on its Robotaxi plans, providing significant insights for Tesla stock investors. Musk explained Tesla\u2019s business model for the Robotaxi service, comparing it to a blend of Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). This model consists of two main components:\n\nTesla will own and operate a fleet of cars. When a user reserves a ride in one of these vehicles, the payment goes directly to Tesla. Additionally, a significant number of robotaxis will\u00a0be owned\u00a0by private individuals. These privately-owned vehicles will also be available for reservation, and the payments for these rides will go to the vehicle owners. This setup allows for flexibility, as owners might offer rides for free to family members or friends.\n\nThis dual-ownership model aims to maximize the availability and utilization of Robotaxis, leveraging both Tesla\u2019s fleet and privately owned vehicles to meet demand.\n\nOne of\u00a0the primary challenges Tesla faces\u00a0is overcoming regulatory hurdles to get its self-driving cars on the roads globally. There are already a few states in the U.S. with autonomous vehicle laws\u00a0and driverless cars operating\u00a0in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas.\u00a0These existing autonomous cars are paving the way for broader regulatory approval in the U.S., which Tesla believes will facilitate its entry into these markets.\n\nElon Musk has noted that it is beneficial for Tesla that other autonomous car companies are cutting through the regulatory jungle. These companies\u2019 operations and data collection in challenging areas help Tesla by providing insights and easing the path for its vehicles. Interestingly, unlike in other\u00a0areas\u00a0where Tesla prefers to lead, Tesla is comfortable not being the first mover in this scenario. Tesla remains confident that its technology will be superior once fully operational.\n\nOn August 8, Tesla will unveil its Robotaxi service. According to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, a long-term Tesla bull, this day will mark a historical event as the company reveals its broader strategy. Ives believes that the market will witness the execution of this strategy alongside the launch of a sub-$30,000 vehicle. He suggests that the bottom for Tesla is in and argues that betting against Elon Musk is the wrong call, considering Tesla\u2019s extensive installed base and deep involvement in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom my perspective,\u00a0valuing Tesla solely as an electric vehicle\u00a0manufacturer\u00a0doesn\u2019t fully capture\u00a0its worth, especially given its valuation, which far surpasses that of traditional car companies.\u00a0The prospect of the Robotaxi service is unprecedented. This disruptive technology, though intangible,\u00a0stands out as a compelling reason for investors to find Tesla\u2019s premium valuation of 74x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio appealing.\n\nTesla\u2019s Leader Is Re-Engaged\n\nIn recent years, concerns have arisen about Elon Musk\u2019s ability to focus on Tesla, given his involvement in multiple ventures such as SpaceX, Neuralink, and others. Critics argue that Tesla requires a dedicated leader, and Musk\u2019s divided attention could potentially harm the company\u2019s success.\n\nHowever, Elon Musk is deeply intertwined with Tesla, embodying its vision and driving innovation. Despite his busy schedule, recent developments indicate a renewed focus on Tesla. This \u201cold school\u201d Musk appears revitalized, especially in light of recent votes of confidence from shareholders.\n\nDuring the recent Tesla shareholder meeting, shareholders re-approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation plan, highlighting their strong support for Musk\u2019s leadership at the company. However, the vote still requires formal legal approval, and its certainty remains uncertain, potentially leading to months of litigation. Earlier this year, the compensation plan encountered challenges in Delaware, where it was described as \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the approval of this plan had a notable impact on Tesla\u2019s stock, reflecting concerns about the company\u2019s leadership. Now, with a clearer indication that Musk will continue to lead Tesla with increased focus and energy, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas believes, and I concur, that there is potential for the company to unify strategies across Elon Musk\u2019s ventures, including xAI and the social media platform X.\n\nIs TSLA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus on Wall Street regarding TSLA reveals analysts are sitting on the fence with a Hold rating. Out of 33 analysts, 10 are Bullish, nine are bearish, and 14 are neutral. The average Tesla stock price target is $176.96, indicating a potential downside of 3.3%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough bearish momentum still prevails over TSLA due to its potentially stretched valuation based on ambitious future projections, I believe that the unveiling of the Robotaxi execution plans could justify TSLA\u2019s valuation. Additionally, resolving concerns over Elon Musk\u2019s leadership may mark a transition from bearish to bullish momentum for the world\u2019s largest EV company.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 15 Best Places in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security and in this article, we will talk about the Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nAI in retirement\n\nRecently, Mercer LLC carried out a survey to study the use of AI within investment management companies. According to the survey, on average, managers in 9 out of 10 firms reported that they were either using or planned to use AI in their investment processes. The same survey highlighted that even though the use of AI in asset management is widespread, it is currently restricted to augmenting existing capabilities. However, going forward, it is likely that AI will play a pivotal role in various spheres of asset management, including retirement planning.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) has highlighted how the integration of AI in retirement planning can unfold limitless opportunities for fiduciaries. Similarly, AI might also help retirees through its ability to generate personalized insights. By using AI, retirees may soon be able to adopt an investment strategy tailored to their specific needs, thus allowing them to maximize their ability to build a retirement nest egg. In fact, Vanguard has already introduced some degree of AI into its financial advice tool, Robo-Advisor.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), one of the companies at the forefront of AI integration in the finance sector, made headlines last September when it launched an internal AI model. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) introduced a language model-powered AI assistant that leverages OpenAI\u2019s technology and assists the firm\u2019s Advisors in their day-to-day activities. In April, the company released its quarterly financials, posting a revenue of $15 billion with an EPS of $2.02.\n\nThe company\u2019s wealth management segment contributed 45% of its total revenue. Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% YoY to $6.88 billion as a result of improved asset management fees. Consequently, share prices have increased significantly since the company released its Q1 earnings, rising from $89 on April 16th to $97 on May 31st.\n\nWhile we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) stock and its ability to generate returns in the near future, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time-frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI and Financial Literacy\n\nAI tools that offer personalized solutions might soon revolutionize the entire retirement savings industry. One reason that AI\u2019s ability to offer personalized solutions is so valuable is they can help make up for a lack of financial literacy among Americans. Our article on Best Places in Utah for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security reveals how financial literacy can be linked to retirement wellness. Alarmingly, MassMutual claims that nearly 80% of people nearing retirement don't have a basic knowledge of Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nOne way to address a lack of financial literacy is through the use of AI financial advisors who can guide seniors through various aspects of retirement planning. Apart from helping seniors adopt a tailored investment strategy, AI tools can also help them attain maximum benefits from their pensions and social security. Forbes reports that 96% of Americans lose an average of $111,000 in their Social Security income due to errors made while filing for benefits. Thus, an AI tool capable of assessing an individual\u2019s circumstances can be invaluable to retirees as they step into their golden years.\n\nAnother reason that such tools have the potential to be so successful is that retirement plans tend to vary significantly based on personal preferences such as quality of life, duration of retirement, and location. Consequently, people often tend to underestimate the amount of money they need to save, how much of their savings they should withdraw, and when to retire in order to secure a comfortable retirement.\n\nBest Places for Retirement in America\n\nAn analysis of the real estate market in America shows that the cost of living and housing vary considerably based on geographical factors. For example, while Florida is often considered one of the best states for retirement due to factors such as weather, recreation, and tax-friendliness, housing costs in the Sunshine State are quite expensive. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z) reports that the median rental cost in Florida is currently $2,500 per month, which is 17.6% higher than the national median. Thus, retirees who find themselves strapped for cash might find it more convenient to pick a more affordable retirement destination.\n\nOur articles on the best places to retire in Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Idaho highlight how some of the best places to retire in America might be in the American West. For example, Nevada is one of the Most Tax-Friendly States to Retire in. It has zero state income tax, meaning that all forms of retirement income, such as 401Ks, pensions, and social security remain untaxed. Furthermore, our list of 13 States That Don\u2019t Tax Retirement Income shows that although Nevada\u2019s sales tax rates tend to be high, average property taxes are relatively low at just 0.48%.\n\nIn addition, according to Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z), the median rental price in Nevada is $2,100, just shy of the national median. There are plenty of places in the Silver State where retirees can find the right balance of comfort and affordability, even if they wish to live on only social security. Thus, for those wondering if Nevada is good for seniors to live on retirement income, join us as we look at the best places in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security. The Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security\n\nThe Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of best places in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security, we initially picked out the most recommended places in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security on the internet. We used 10+ sources including our article on Best Places to Retire in Nevada, Smart Asset, and Movoto to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only.\n\nAmongst these, we developed a scorecard using metrics such as livability scores, cost of living, and average rent. Livability scores were sourced from Area Vibes while median rent was obtained from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z). By standardizing these metrics on a linear scale, each place was scored, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 15 places were chosen for our list.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nOur methodology revealed that Lovelock is the Best Place in Nevada for a Couple to Live on only Social Security.\n\n1. Lovelock\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 11.05\n\nLivability Score: 71\n\nMedian Rent: $955\n\nIM Cost of Living: 80.9\n\nLovelock is located off Interstate Highway 80, just under a hundred miles from Reno. It is primarily an agricultural and livestock city. Although it lacks recreational value, there are a few attractions that residents can enjoy, such as the Lovelock Caves or the nearby Rye Patch State Recreation Area. What makes Lovelock the best place in Nevada for a couple to live on only social security is its incredibly low cost of living. Compared to the national average, the cost of living in the city is 21% lower. Moreover, median rent in Lovelock is $955, which is nearly 55% lower than the national median.\n\nTo learn about more places in Nevada to retire on only Social Security, check out 15 Best Places in Nevada for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best online banks; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "Regulators find weakness in 'living wills' from BofA, Citi, Goldman and JPM",
        "content": "Regulators found weaknesses in \"living wills\" submitted by four of the country\u2019s largest banks detailing how the lenders would wind themselves down if something catastrophic were to happen.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determined that there was a \"shortcoming\" in the plans submitted in 2023 by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C).\n\nA shortcoming, according to the agencies, is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of the plan.\n\nWhere the two regulators disagreed was about the severity of weakness in the plan submitted by Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC said it found the bank\u2019s plan weak enough to be considered a more serious \"deficiency,\" while the Fed stuck with the less-severe \"shortcoming\" rating. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe banks must tell regulators by September how they plan to fix their weaknesses, and they must also address the shortcomings in their next resolution plans due by July 1, 2025.\n\nRegulators didn\u2019t identify material weakness in the plans submitted by other large banks including Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), State Street (STT) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nLiving wills emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when a housing meltdown and the unraveling of Lehman Brothers triggered chaos across the financial system, taxpayer bailouts for giant financial institutions and a cascading series of bank failures.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank legislation passed in 2010 made it a requirement for banks of a certain size to put together these plans on a regular basis, showing how they could be wound down in the event of a crisis without putting the greater financial system at risk.\n\nThe shortcomings in the 2023 plans from JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman and Citigroup happened when they were asked to simulate an unwind of their derivatives and trading positions in two scenarios with different time frames.\n\nIn the case of Citigroup, regulators said the weakness had to do with a shortcoming identified in its 2021 plan \"regarding resolution data integrity and data management issues.\"\n\n\"The agencies have significant concerns with the amount of time that will be necessary to remediate the significant resolution data integrity weaknesses.\"\n\nIn a closed meeting Thursday on the topic, the FDIC's vice chairman Travis Hill voted against the board majority giving Citi a deficiency rating, finding the weakness in Citi's plan not as severe. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation headquarters, in Washington, DC. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The institution is in the midst of a multiyear process to address these underlying issues, which the firm\u2019s management has prioritized,\" Hill said in a statement Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitigroup said in a statement that \"we are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators. While we\u2019ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we\u2019ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas, including improving data quality and regulatory processes such as resolution planning.\u201d\n\nThe disclosure comes three days after Citigroup held an investor day to showcase its best-performing business and tout its transformation into a more efficient company.\n\nCEO Jane Fraser told investors during that event that the bank will do whatever it takes to get their regulatory processes up to snuff.\n\n\"We recognize there are places where progress has been too slow, so we have intensified our efforts in areas such as regulatory processes and the related data remediation,\" Fraser said Tuesday.\n\nThe company added in a statement Friday that \"we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

John Moore, the person heading the Latin America region for MS, said that because of wars in Europe and the Middle East, and increasing tensions in Asia, the importance of Latin America has risen \u201cfor reorganizing supply chains and accessing everything from food and industrial metals to transition fuels and pharmaceutical ingredients.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiven Latin America\u2019s growing economic importance, Morgan Stanley is steadily increasing its investments in Brazil, Mexico and other Latin American countries.\r\n\r\nThe firm is adding personnel and capital, with significant opportunities seen in merger-and-acquisition advice, capital-markets underwriting, sales and trading, and private credit.\r\n\r\nNotably, Brazil presents substantial opportunities in technology-enabled fintech, e-commerce and renewable energy, including second-generation ethanol for aviation. Despite fiscal concerns, foreign interest remains strong in Brazil.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s investment activity in Argentina depends on the implementation of fiscal and tax reforms. If the government takes positive steps like reducing inflation and cutting tax, investments in Argentina would increase.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned investments, MS plans to continue serving clients across its institutional and wealth businesses in Peru, Colombia and Chile.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite Latin America\u2019s increased economic potential, the region still faces the impacts of volatility. Moore added, \u201cObviously there are macro rate headwinds and political transitions throughout the region and globally, with Mexico and Brazil underperforming US markets year-to-date.\u201d\r\n\r\nOver the past six months, MS shares have gained 5.4% compared with the industry\u2019s 14.3% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nExpansion Efforts by Other Firms\n\nGiven that India\u2019s asset management industry is rapidly growing, Wall Street firms like JPMorgan JPM and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK are considering entry. According to people with knowledge of the matter, JPM and BK already have strategies ready on how they will operate in India.\r\n\r\nJPM and BNY Mellon plan to begin operations in India in the next 12-18 months. However, the timelines for approaching SEBI to seek licenses to operate in the country\u2019s asset management industry are not yet known.\r\n\r\nBoth firms will likely have different styles of entering the India market. While JPMorgan\u2019s execution strategy is not yet clear, BNY Mellon plans to enter India with its own products and distribution channel.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The action follows a recommendation by Japan\u2019s securities watchdog earlier this month.\n\nSpokespeople for MUFG and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities declined to comment.

The timeline for the punishment was first reported by Kyodo News.\n\nCommercial and investment banking arms of the same financial group are forbidden in Japan from sharing client data, in part to keep lenders from abusing their bargaining positions.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission this month said the firms exchanged information at least 26 times in order to win business. The market watchdog had also found other improper conducts, including cases in which MUFG Bank tried to win underwriting businesses for the brokerage unit.\n\nThe banking industry has long lobbied for this rule to be relaxed, arguing it would better serve clients\u2019 interests if banks and their group brokerages can offer products and services together.

        "content": "Investing.com - In a strategy update released on Thursday, Morgan Stanley made significant alterations to its US Model Portfolio.\n\nThe changes include adding Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) due to its cyclical leverage to improving order rates in transportation end markets and potential secular tailwinds from power generation demand due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThey have also decided to remove QUALCOMM Inc (QCOM) as they believe the company's valuation effectively prices the underlying improvement in cyclical end markets and Edge AI opportunity.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! CLICK HERE to take advantage and accelerate your investments!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nCummins Inc (CMI) has been added to the portfolio for three main reasons. Firstly, CMI offers cyclical leverage from improvements in transportation end markets. Secondly, its exposure to the \"powering Gen AI\" theme provides secular growth tailwinds. Lastly, Morgan Stanley believes CMI trades at a reasonable valuation. As a large provider of power generation equipment, CMI is expected to benefit from increased content and structural demand tailwinds.\n\nMorgan Stanley is removing QUALCOMM Inc (QCOM) from its portfolio as they believe the company's valuation effectively prices the underlying improvement in cyclical end markets and Edge AI opportunity. Since its addition to the portfolio in March 2021, QCOM has gained 83%, outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark which was up by 46% over the same period.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Morgan Stanley has also made risk management-driven adjustments to its portfolio. It has increased its internally held portfolio weights in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), TransDigm Inc (TDG), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Becton Dickinson & Co (NYSE:BDX), and decreased its internally held portfolio weights in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMorgan Stanley adjusts its US Model Portfolio\n\nExclusive-Boeing nearing deal with supplier Spirit Aero after months of talks, sources say\n\nNvidia loses top spot to Microsoft after 3% drop\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If making money from stocks is your goal, you need to get started sooner rather than later. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of money to start your stock investment journey and while $100 isn\u2019t a lot, it isn\u2019t very little either. If you are investing through a no-commission broker, you can put all your $100 into the right stocks. There are several stocks under $100 to buy this month.\n\nWhen looking for stocks, it helps to identify companies with a rich history, solid fundamentals, and expertise that sets them apart from their competitors. I\u2019ve identified three standout stocks under $100 you could buy this month. All three companies have a strong industry presence, hold a solid market share, and have reported impressive first-quarter numbers. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nStocks Under $100 to Buy: Morgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) enjoys a diversified income and has reported an impressive first quarter. It saw a 16% year-over-year jump in the investment banking revenue and a 5% jump in the wealth management segment. The net revenue stood at $15.1 billion while the net income came in at $3.4 billion. The 14% jump in the profit was driven by the rise in the investment banking business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUp 3% year to date, the stock is trading for $97 and has been in this range since the past month. It managed to hit $103 in May but has lost value over the past few weeks. I believe Morgan Stanley is in the recovery stage and an improvement in the economy will boost its business. Analysts are optimistic about the earnings growth of the company which could be driven by a rebound in deals in the IPO market.\n\nMorgan Stanley is set to report results on July 16 and Zacks expects an EPS of $1.66, which could be a 33.87% jump while the revenue could see a 6% jump to hit $14.28 billion.\n\nThe stock also enjoys a dividend yield of 3.48% and if you are looking to grow your $100 into passive income, this is one stock that will keep rewarding you. Morgan Stanley is a long-term buy-and-hold financial stock.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve been pounding the table for Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). One of the best AI stocks to own right now, PLTR is up 55% YTD and 63% in the past 12 months. Trading at $25, the stock is set to hit a new 52-week high very soon. A tech giant, Palantir has been in the industry for two decades\u00a0and is\u00a0the government\u2019s favorite service provider.\n\nHowever, the company has diversified the business and is now growing the commercial segment as well. In the first-quarter results, Palantir reported a 69% YOY jump in commercial clients, and the commercial segment revenue soared 40% YOY. Its total\u00a0revenue\u00a0was up 21%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rising demand for AI software has driven Palantir\u2019s revenue which owns an Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) that has become a big hit amongst companies. Palantir is cashing in on this opportunity and has seen a 38% jump in outstanding performance obligations to $1.3 billion in the first quarter.\n\nPalantir has a healthy pipeline for revenue and considering the massive surge in the demand for AI, the company is set to benefit. Argus Research has a buy rating for the stock with a price target of $29. The analyst believes that Palantir has the potential to capitalize on the rising AI demand from the commercial segment.\n\nChewy (CHWY) The Chewy logo on a banner at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nA promising growth stock, Chewy is set to make the most of the growing pet products market. The company is a retailer of pet food and pet products. Up 16% YTD, CHWY stock is exchanging hands for $25. It soared last month after reporting impressive first-quarter results. The company has seen a rise in e-commerce sales and its revenue stood at $2.88 billion. The EPS was 31 cents.\n\nAccording to the\u00a0National Pet Owners Survey, about 86.9 million families own a pet in the U.S. Additionally, more people consider their pets as family members now and are happy to spend money on their products. This has led to a steady rise in the demand for pet products.\n\nChewy has also announced a $500 million share buyback plan after positive first-quarter results. While it is hard for Chewy to achieve the pandemic highs it did in 2021, it is seeing an improvement in profitability. Pet adoptions surged during the pandemic and the stock hit new all-time highs. The business growth has slowed but there is a chance of a rebound in the pet industry.\n\nThe management is expecting a slowdown in growth in the second quarter from 2% to 3% while for the full year, it is aiming for a growth rate of 4% to 6%. As the pet sector strengthens, revenue growth could bounce back. Buying the stock in the dip is a smart move.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Looks to Latin America as Global Tensions Rise",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley is increasing its investments in Latin America as geopolitical conflicts elsewhere in the world give the region increasing prominence in the global economy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCar Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack Putin\u2019s Hybrid War Opens a Second Front on NATO\u2019s Eastern Border Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Manchester United\u2019s Jim Ratcliffe Fears for Future of Premier League\n\nWars in Europe and the Middle East and rising tensions in Asia highlight the importance of Latin America \u201cfor reorganizing supply chains and accessing everything from food and industrial metals to transition fuels and pharmaceutical ingredients,\u201d John Moore, who heads the Latin America region for Morgan Stanley, said in an interview.\n\nCiting \u201cdeglobalization\u201d trends around the world, Moore said the bank has \u201csteadily increased our investment in Brazil, Mexico and other Latin America geographies, a trend we expect to see continue\u201d with incremental increases of people and capital.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which also has outlets in Argentina, Chile and Colombia, sees opportunities for investment-banking gains in merger-and-acquisition advice, capital-markets underwriting, sales and trading, and private credit, he said. The New York-based company has about 400 people serving Latin American clients in those business.\n\nOne of the five biggest wealth managers for rich individuals from the region, the firm expanded that business\u2019s assets about 6% last year, to roughly $120 billion.\n\nStill, Latin America isn\u2019t immune to volatility. \u201cObviously there are macro rate headwinds and political transitions throughout the region and globally, with Mexico and Brazil underperforming US markets year-to-date,\u201d Moore said.\n\nMexico Elections\n\nMexico\u2019s newly elected president, Claudia Sheinbaum, brings a layer of uncertainty for investors. She was widely expected to win and bring a more market-friendly posture to Mexico. But the ruling coalition\u2019s near supermajority in congress blindsided investors, who fear lawmakers will pass constitutional reforms that could erode checks on power and pressure the budget. The peso has lost almost 8% against the dollar so far this year.\n\n\u201cTo me, there is an abundance and variety of opportunities in Mexico, with the increased flows of foreign direct investment and remittances supporting the peso, cross-border M&A, and hedging and derivatives associated with underwriting,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe recently checked with clients who had plans for Mexico, and they remain on track following the election results.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley was among underwriters of the $677.4 million initial public offering of BBB Foods Inc., the operator of a discount retailer in Mexico, which priced in February in the US. The company, a holding firm that conducts business through its main subsidiary, Tiendas 3B, raised its price range during the deal, which was more than 10 times oversubscribed.\n\nThe investment bank also participated on the transaction of Peruvian health-care company Auna SA, and is among the announced underwriters for an expected IPO of Grupo Aeromexico SAB, the Mexican carrier that emerged from bankruptcy protection more than two years ago.\n\nMorgan Stanley Tactical Value \u2014 which makes private, long-term and likely illiquid investments \u2014 was among investors in a $100 million funding round by Mexico payments startup Clip, announced earlier this week.\n\nThe volume of equity offerings by Latin American companies is up 34% so far this year, to $3.64 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nBrazil Investments\n\nIn Brazil, fiscal concerns have also been pressuring the real, which lost 10% of its value so far this year. But foreigners are still interested in investing there, given the cohort of technology-enabled fintechs and e-commerce firms as well as a \u201chuge ESG opportunity\u201d in renewables, Moore said. They include second-generation ethanol for aviation from sugar cane biomass, as well as local infrastructure development. The war in Ukraine also put a spotlight on energy and food exports from Brazil that can be supplied to Europe, he said.\n\nIn Argentina, if the government is able to implement fiscal and tax reforms, \u201cthere will be more activity and investment from Morgan Stanley as well,\u201d Moore said. He praised the reduction in inflation, tax cuts and privatization plans that are underway. In Peru, Colombia and Chile, the idea is to \u201ccontinue serving clients across our institutional and wealth businesses.\u201d\n\nWith elevated volatility and expectations that interest rates will remain higher for longer than previously expected, structured credit can help clients reduce funding costs, Moore said. The integrated bank can also offer solutions across currency, rate and commodity exposures.\n\nMorgan Stanley was among banks benefiting from the merger between Credit Suisse and UBS Group AG, since rich clients with accounts in both Zurich-based banks looked for diversification at competitors. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley lost a few advisers amid a regulatory review in recent years focused on whether the wealth-management business was taking adequate measures to prevent money laundering by wealthy clients from outside the US.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which serves rich Latin Americans from offshore wealth-management booking centers such as New York and Miami, is planning to keep expanding that business, after the unit doubled its revenue in the past seven years, Moore said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 50 Largest Companies in Every State in the US, and in this article we will look at the largest company.\n\nEconomy of\u00a0 US\n\nThe United States holds the title of the largest economy in the world, according to the IMF in 2024 the United States had a GDP of approximately $28.78 trillion, a GDP per capita of around $85,370, and an annual GDP growth rate of 2.7%. In 2025, GDP is expected to rise to $29.84 trillion whereas GDP per capita is expected to rise around $87,980. The United States possesses a large and skilled labor force, a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit along with highly diversified companies in technology, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment which generate productivity and economic growth. Additionally, the U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency and is used to facilitate international trade and investment.\n\nCertain regions in the United States stand out as hubs of economic power and innovation. Silicon Valley in the San Franciso Bay Area, California has long been the hub of technological innovation in software, hardware, and biotechnology. Some of the largest tech giants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) among many others are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Wall Street, the financial district in Lower Manhattan in New York City on the other side is home to major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Wall Street serves as the center of the world's financial markets and facilitates the flow of capital, investments, and trading activities on a massive scale. In recent years, there has been a notable trend of companies relocating from high-tax states to low-tax states in pursuit of cost savings and favorable business environments. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are some of the largest companies that moved their incorporations from California to Texas. According to CNBC, more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Delaware. Delaware is one of the top choices for corporations due to their business-friendly policies, lower taxes, reduced regulation, and incentives for relocation. Delaware has a strategic location and its corporate law is highly developed, the state's Court of Chancery, a specialized court for business disputes, is known for its efficient resolution of legal cases. It allows businesses to maintain confidentiality and offers incentives for relocation such as tax credits, grants, and loans. Delaware does not have a state sales tax, and its corporate income tax of 8.7% is considered one of the lowest in the United States. You can also take a look at 15 States with No or Lowest Sales Tax Rates in the US.\n\nStory continues\n\nLargest Company in the US\n\nFounded in 1975, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a globally recognized company known for its software products, such as the Windows operating system and Office productivity tools. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure AI has also continued to lead in innovation by offering advanced APIs and models that are revolutionizing industries with its responsible AI solutions that facilitate the creation, reception, and interaction with images, videos, and audio.\u00a0Azure's market share is expanding due to its extensive portfolio of AI and cloud services. Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies and 53,000 customers now use the Azure OpenAI Service. The introduction of the Models as a Service API and partnerships with Nvidia and AMD for AI hardware accelerators are significantly boosting the growth of Microsoft's cloud business. Additionally, Microsoft's Copilot offerings, integrated into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, are transforming productivity and democratizing AI-powered capabilities, further increasing Microsoft's share in office productivity tools.\n\nAzure AI Services has also impacted the legal industry by efficiently managing and analyzing vast amounts of data in the fast-paced legal environment and the legal field is highly exposed to the effects of new AI technologies. With traditional data sources like emails and documents now supplemented by complex data types such as chat data and video recordings, legal teams face significant challenges. AI is increasingly used to streamline processes, reduce risks, and boost efficiency. Companies like Icertis, Relativity, and Clifford Chance are at the forefront of integrating AI into their operations by leveraging Azure AI Services to enhance contract management, e-discovery, and overall legal service delivery. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) commitment to responsible AI, ensuring data privacy, security, and governance highlights how AI advancements are driving growth, productivity, and innovation across industries.\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported that its revenue for the three months ended March 31, increased by 17% year over year to $61.9 billion and net income increased by 20% year over year to $21.9 billion. The company\u2019s Azure and cloud services revenue increased 31% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue amounted to $35.1 billion.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley, leads the world in technology and innovation and New York\u2019s Wall Street serves as the global hub for banking, investments, and trading, each state in the United States possesses its own unique strengths and specialties. With this context, let\u2019s take a look at the list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been bringing up the rear among the three main U.S. stock indices. While the benchmark S&P 500 and technology-laden Nasdaq indices are up 15.69% and 21% respectively in 2024, and at all-time highs, the blue-chip Dow is up a measly 2%. The underperformance is being blamed on a handful of the Dow\u2019s 30 component stocks.\n\nWhile many of the stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are outperforming the broader market this year, several are deep in the red. In fact, some of the worst performing stocks of the year can be found among the Dow 30, and that fact has been holding the index back compared to its peers. This has led to renewed calls for an overhaul of the nearly 140 year old index.\n\nHere are three Dow stocks to sell in June before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts at investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) just lowered their price target on Nike (NYSE:NKE) stock to $114 per share from $116 previously. The analysts warned that the company\u2019s upcoming financial results and guidance could be below expectations when the company next reports earnings on June 27. The Morgan Stanley downgrade is the latest knock on the stock of the sneaker and sports apparel giant.\n\nNKE stock has been a big disappointment in recent years. The share price today is 46% below the peak it reached in November 2021 during the end of the pandemic rally.\n\nSo far this year, the Dow component has dropped 11%, completely missing out on the current rally. Weighing on the share price have been slumping international sales, particularly in China, and rising competition from other popular sneaker makers such as Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK).\n\nThe upcoming financial results from Nike could be a make or break moment for the stock. Investors may want to exercise caution and sell the shares now.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that has been completely undone by its financial performance has been Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The cloud-computing giant\u2019s stock has cratered ever since the company issued disappointing first-quarter financial results.\n\nCRM stock is now down 9.50% on the year, making it a Dow stock to sell. The share price has declined about 25% since peaking at the start of March this year, with no bottom in sight.\n\nCRM stock went into freefall after Salesforce\u2019s Q1 revenue missed Wall Street\u2019s target for the first time since 2006. Executives blamed the miss on longer deal cycles and the implementation of a new go-to-market strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Salesforce\u2019s forward guidance also missed analysts\u2019 forecasts, further hurting the stock. Management said that they expect deal compression and slowing projects in professional services to weigh on the company\u2019s financial performance going forward. Time to sell.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDow stock UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has been hurt by a crippling cyberattack at its subsidiary Change Healthcare and by poor sentiment towards healthcare stocks. Shares of the largest medical insurance company in the U.S. are down 11% this year and up only 2.48% over the last 12 months.\n\nThis after UnitedHealth disclosed in February that a cyberattack breached part of Change Healthcare\u2019s information technology network.\n\nThe fallout from the cyberattack has been far reaching across the American healthcare sector, with doctors left without a way to fill prescriptions or get paid for their services. The company is still working to bring parts of its system back online. UnitedHealth has said that the cyberattack at Change Healthcare cost it 74 cents per share in its most recent earnings print, and that its full-year impact is likely to be between $1.15 and $1.35 a share. The cyberattack looks likely to weigh on UNH stock for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in DECK.

        "title": "CME Group: Threat of New Competition Is Fully Priced In",
        "content": "CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) has a long history of delivering solid results for investors. Over the past 10 years, the financial services company has delivered investors a total return of roughly 325%. Comparably, the S&P 500 has posted a total return of roughly 230% over the same period.\n\nThe stock's move higher has been a result of strong earnings growth for the company. CME has benefited from steady increases in trading volume for key products and the launch of additional products.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CME.\n\nWhile CME is fairly diversified in terms of its product offerings, the company's biggest business segment is interest rates, which account for roughly 28% of total revenue. Key product offerings in this segment include U.S. Treasury futures and secured overnight financing rate futures. CME Group: Threat of New Competition Is Fully Priced In\n\nThreat of new competition\n\nCME has long dominated the U.S. interest rate futures market as its market share of trading volume in this segment is estimated to be more than 99%. The company's dominance of this business has given it solid pricing power and helped it deliver industry best profit margins. Its net profit margin of roughly 57% compares favorably to peers such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) and CBOE Global Markets (CBOE), which have profit margins of roughly 24% and 21%.\n\nDespite its strong position in the interest rate futures market, Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and BGC Partners (NASDAQ:BGC), has recently decided to challenge CME in this market. BGC's FMX trading platform, which has an estimated 28% market share in cash Treasuries trading, is expected to introduce SOFR futures in September 2024 followed by U.S. Treasury futures in early 2025.\n\nThe FMX futures platform is backed by large financial institutions, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citadel Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and others. Lutnick has said the FMX plans to compete with CME by offering lower trading fees and more product innovation.\n\nNot the fist time CME has faced competition\n\nDuring CME's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Terry Duffy responded to an analyst question regarding new competition from FMX:\n\nI have sat here for 22 years as the chairman and CEO of this company since we went public, and I've seen nothing but competition my entire career, so this is no different. I take every single bit of competition seriously, as I'm sure others do about CME as we continue to move our business forward.\n\nIn 2009, Lutnick-backed ELX Futures tried to compete with CME on interest rate futures, but failed to gain much traction due to a lack of clearing arrangements. In 2011, it also faced a challenge from NYSE Euronext, now owned by Intercontinental Exchange, which also failed to gain traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nFMX poses a more serious threat, but CME still has the advantage\n\nThe key difference between BGC's FMX futures offering and previous challenges to CME's dominance in interest rate futures is the fact the company has arranged for trades to be cleared through LCH. Historically, no competitor was able to deliver interest rate futures through a well-established clearing house as CME did not allow competitors to clear through its clearing house. LCH is one of the largest clearing houses in the world and thus, has the potential to offer FMX futures users efficient margining, which is similar to what CME can offer.\n\nFMX poses a significant threat to CME due to the fact it is backed by a large consortium of sophisticated financial services companies and has arranged for clearing through LCH. However, I believe that as the incumbent, CME has a significant advantage. Market participants are likely to require a significant incentive to move over to a new exchange, which could increase operational complexity related to trading.\n\nCME could temporarily lower trading fees to eliminate any incentive for market participants to move over to FMX. While such an approach might result in a near-term hit to profits, CME would remain highly profitable due to its other businesses and would be able to raise fees again in the future once the FMX threat is gone.\n\nAs the incumbent, CME also benefits from already having a much more liquid marketplace than BGC's FMX platform is likely to have initially. Thus, large trade orders are likely to continue to be routed through CME due to superior liquidity, which may make it difficult for FMX to gain market share.\n\nValuation is below historical norms\n\nCME currently trades at roughly 20 times forward earnings. While this valuation level represents a slight discount to the broader market, it is a significant discount to the valuation it has traded at over the past several years.\n\nWhile the company has only moderate growth prospects, which tend to be heavily impacted by market moves and volatility, I believe the stock deserves to trade at a premium to the broader market. Historically, over the past 10 years, the company has grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of roughly 11%. In addition to delivering strong earnings growth, CME benefits from limited cyclicality as trading activity, which drives fees, tends to increase during times of market stress. For this reason, I believe investors should be willing to pay a premium for CME shares as it is one of the few that benefits from challenging economic conditions.\n\nSince the SEC approved BGC's proposed interest rate futures offering on Jan. 22, CME shares have fallen by roughly 3%. The S&P 500 has risen by roughly 10% over the same period, while BGC Group shares have risen by roughly 16%.\n\nOver the past five years, CME has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of roughly 29.50. Thus, the stock's current valuation represents a discount to recent historical norms. Moreover, the stock has a GF Value of $228 per share, which suggests the stock is modestly undervalued based on historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings estimates. CME Group: Threat of New Competition Is Fully Priced In\n\nRegulatory risk\n\nWhile I am a bullish on CME and believe the company is well positioned to fend off the challenge from BGC's FMX, regulatory risk remains a potential concern. Given its massive scale and unique position within the financial system, the company faces extensive regulation. While CME enjoys a near monopoly position in the U.S. interest rate futures market, regulators could decide that this poses a threat to the financial system and create incentives to increase competition. For example, regulators could require CME to open its clearing house to other exchanges. Moreover, regulators could also challenge its right to exclusively list other key products such as S&P 500 Index futures, which represent a key revenue driver.\n\nConclusion\n\nCME benefits from a dominant position in the U.S. interest rate futures market, which has helped the company maintain very high profit margins historically. The highly profitable nature of this business has drawn competition previously, but no other exchange has successfully challenged it in this business.\n\nBGC's FMX futures represent a new challenger to CME and is a potential threat due to the sophistication of its backers and agreement with LCH on clearing. The threat has helped drive CME shares lower in recent months and the stock now trades at a discount to its own historical average.\n\nAs the incumbent, CME is well position to fend off competition from the FMX platform. Thus, I believe its shares are undervalued and investors currently have the chance to purchase a very high-quality company at an attractive valuation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) closed the most recent trading day at $97.57, moving +0.55% from the previous trading session. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.25%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.15%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.03%.\n\nShares of the investment bank witnessed a loss of 3.28% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Finance sector with its loss of 2.3% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.34%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Morgan Stanley in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on July 16, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.66, marking a 33.87% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.28 billion, up 6.09% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.83 per share and revenue of $57.84 billion. These totals would mark changes of +25.09% and +6.82%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. Right now, Morgan Stanley possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Morgan Stanley has a Forward P/E ratio of 14.2 right now. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 17.94.\n\nIt's also important to note that MS currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.18. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Financial - Investment Bank industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.12.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 27, which puts it in the top 11% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "US Retail Sales Barely Increase In Sign of Consumer Strain",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US retail sales barely rose in May and prior months were revised lower, pointing to greater financial strain among consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Flesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan These Are the World\u2019s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds\u2019 Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas Ex-Trump Adviser Urges Him to Cut Ties With China, Restart Nuclear Tests\n\nThe value of retail purchases, unadjusted for inflation, increased 0.1% after an downwardly revised 0.2% drop in the prior month, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. Excluding gasoline, sales rose 0.3%.\n\nOf the 13 categories tracked by the Commerce Department, five showed declines as gasoline prices were cheaper in the month and furniture outlets offered discounts for Memorial Day.\n\nThe figures underscore a notable downshift in consumer spending after stronger readings earlier in the year. Economists expect a moderate pace of spending going forward as Americans exercise greater prudence given persistent inflation, a gradually cooling job market and emerging signs of financial stress.\n\n\u201cWith services consumption growth slowing in recent months and consumer confidence plummeting again, maybe households aren\u2019t quite as impervious to higher interest rates as we were beginning to believe,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.\n\nData out last week showed US consumer and producer prices were both softer than expected in May, which should help bolster the Federal Reserve\u2019s confidence that they can lower interest rates soon. In keeping rates steady last week, Chair Jerome Powell said consumer spending is still growing solidly and that the household sector is in \u201cpretty good shape.\u201d\n\nTreasury yields declined as the report signaled some softening in the economy.\n\nThe retail report showed so-called control-group sales \u2014 which are used to calculate gross domestic product \u2014 climbed 0.4% in May. It fell 0.5% in the prior month, which was the most in about a year. The measure excludes food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations.\n\nSeparate data on consumer borrowing from earlier this month showed a pullback in credit-card balances for the the first time in three years as households grappled with costlier debt, and delinquencies have continued to rise. That\u2019s taking a toll on sentiment as well.\n\nRetail figures largely reflect purchases of goods, which comprise a relatively narrow share of overall consumer outlays. Data due later this month will provide more details on inflation-adjusted spending on goods and services in May.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpending at restaurants and bars, the only service-sector category of Tuesday\u2019s report, declined 0.4%, the most since January.\n\n--With assistance from Christopher Condon and Chris Middleton.\n\n(Adds graphic, economist\u2019s quote)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Morgan Stanley (MS): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned -3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 3.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.83 points to a change of +25.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.72 indicates a change of +13% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.1%. The $57.84 billion and $60.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.8% and +4.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $15.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. EPS of $2.02 for the same period compares with $1.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.6%. The EPS surprise was +19.53%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Sell Before E-Trade Gives Roaring Kitty the Boot",
        "content": "Roaring Kitty brought meme stocks back to life. His first post in three years in mid-May caused GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares to triple in value almost overnight. It also dragged other left-for-dead meme stocks along for the ride.\n\nYet, the reaction to the meme lord (his real name is Keith Gill) by Wall Street was telling. The Wall Street Journal reported that discount broker E-Trade, owned by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), was mulling whether to ban him from the platform. The investment firm\u2019s financial crimes division was examining whether his options trades before his social media post were legal. The trades also came under scrutiny from the Securities & Exchange Commission and state securities agencies.\n\nWhile we can debate whether the video game retailer is a good investment \u2014 I tend to disagree with Gill \u2014 canceling him and prohibiting him from trading seems extreme.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t be up for debate is the meme stocks to sell below. These companies had no business jumping as they did. Gill wasn\u2019t recommending their shares, only GameStop. Traders were simply trying to revive the meme stock-buying frenzy of 2021.\n\nHere is why you should avoid these meme stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nMovie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) became every bit as much of a poster child for the meme stock trade as GameStop. Diehard loyalists deemed themselves \u201capes\u201d who would HODL (hold on for dear life) to AMC stock no matter what. Unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t amounted to much. Shares have lost 99% of their value from their high point three years ago.\n\nHowever, the Roaring Kitty social media post brought the stock back to life, and a better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report helped it hold onto its value. The movie theater stock has more than doubled from its April lows.\n\nYet better-than-expected does not necessarily mean good or sustainable. AMC Entertainment is still hurting because the movie industry remains in decline. Theater attendance is down as Hollywood forgot how to make blockbuster movies. This summer\u2019s lineup started with a dud, and there are only one or two films that have hopes of hitting it big.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bode well for AMC Entertainment going forward, making it the first meme stock to sell now.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) TRUTH SOCIAL application and logo displayed on smartphone. a social media application created by former US president Donald Trump after being blocked from Facebook. DJT stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) remain flat from where they were when the social media company of former President Donald Trump began trading on the Nasdaq exchange. Over the past month, though, the stock is down 30%. Expect it to continue being volatile.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the presidential campaign heats up heading into November\u2019s elections, investors are likely in for a roller coaster ride as the former president commands even more attention on the national stage. His Truth Social platform will be a key part of how Trump amplifies his message, which could determine whether it remains a viable business.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t look good. Although Trump Media doesn\u2019t publish daily active user numbers, arguing they are not useful for a new platform, sites that track visits indicate usage is falling. While Trump has not really posted much on X (formerly Twitter), CEO Elon Musk will be hosting a town hall-style meeting with him on the platform. That draws attention away from Truth Social.\n\nUltimately, there is a very limited audience for the platform. Because of the president\u2019s polarizing personality, many won\u2019t use the site. It will primarily be for those committed to following Trump. While that\u2019s not necessarily bad, it also doesn\u2019t offer much hope for growth.\n\nAt $37 per share, there is a lot of air under Trump Media & Technology Group stock through which it can fall.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) An image of the logo for BlackBerry Ltd (BB).\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nOnce known for its revolutionary mobile handsets, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is a very different company today. It is now a security and software business, which, though offering critical services, is a shell of its former self. It is experiencing growth but not on a scale necessary to take on its larger, better-financed rivals. There is a niche for BlackBerry stock to exist but not much to make an investment out of.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s main business is cybersecurity. It offers secure communications platforms, endpoint control systems and analytics tools and services. The company is very much in the same vein as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), though on a dramatically smaller scale. It also tends to perform best in regulated markets, such as government, healthcare and financials, where security is paramount. But that could limit growth as well as expansion into other enterprise-class industries.\n\nBlackBerry also targets the auto industry with semiconductor, safety systems and cabin feature technologies. Despite its QNX operating system offering good growth prospects with original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and Tier 1 suppliers, it is the smaller of BlackBerry\u2019s two businesses.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s not a lot to expect from BlackBerry. It is a relatively small fish in a small pond. The stock is down 54% over the past year, and there do not appear to be any catalysts to reverse its course.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Mitsubishi (MUFG) Penalized for Breaching Client Confidentiality",
        "content": "Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. MUFG units are under investigation by Japan\u2019s securities regulator, Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (\u201cSESC\u201d), for compromising its clients' confidentiality by bypassing firewalls between the bank's operations.\r\n\r\nSESC mentioned that MUFG Bank Ltd., Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. shared confidential customer details on at least 10 occasions to attract more business. The exchange breached the regulatory firewalls that were established to prevent commercial and investment banking units from sharing client data.\r\n\r\nThe commercial and investment banking divisions within the same financial group require a strict separation in order to secure client information and avoid any conflicts of interest to arise. These regulations prevent financial institutions from using privileged information to gain an unfair advantage in business negotiations.\r\n\r\nFor an extended period, Japanese banks have advocated for the relaxation of firewalls, citing their impediment to merger advising and business succession planning.\n\nAccording to the SESC, the three firms knowingly shared non-public client data, including material information that could influence investment decisions, despite the client\u2019s reluctance to allow such exchanges. Moreover, MUFG\u2019s employees\u2019 performances were evaluated partly based on the business they directed to Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities (\u201cMUMSS\u201d) in order to increase group-wide income, per the SESC findings.\r\n\r\nMUFG\u2019s management stated, \u201cWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and concern this has caused our customers and other stakeholders\u201d. They further added \u201cWe accept that the current recommendation calls for the appropriate enhancement and acceleration of internal control and checking functions of the MUFG Group Companies in a manner that suits the actual conditions of the banking-securities collaborative business.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe current investigation led to the fallout of business. In lieu of this, Aeon Co., Kanagawa Prefecture, and Japan Housing Finance Agency decided to drop from bond underwriting contracts with MUMSS.\r\n\r\nThe investigation represents the most recent financial crisis to emerge in Japan and represents a setback to the biggest bank in the country, which lost more than $700 million in client losses on Credit Suisse's riskiest bonds last year that they had bought through its brokerage partnership with Morgan Stanley MS.\r\n\r\nThe previous case had already shaken the bank's reputation to a great extent and this new scandal makes it more difficult for MUFG to regain the trust of its customers and to rebuild its image within the financial market.\r\n\r\nThe investigation may disrupt the competitive positioning of the joint ventures of MUFG with Morgan Stanley. The joint venture between both companies was set to overtake Nomura Holdings Inc. as Japan's premier brokerage by combining their Japan equity sales and research for institutional investors. Although Morgan Stanley currently holds the leadership position in advising on Japan-related mergers, the ongoing scandal involving MUFG could significantly impact MS\u2019 market standing and future prospects in the region.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past six months, shares of MUFG have lost 2.9% on the NYSE against the industry\u2019s 1% growth.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, MUFG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStock to Consider\n\nA better-ranked stock from the finance space is NatWest Group plc NWG, flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

For more information about Morgan Stanley, please visit www.morganstanley.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore investing carefully consider the Fund's objective, risks, charges, and expenses available in the prospectus, please download one at https://www.eatonvance.com. Read carefully before investing.\n\nRisk Considerations: There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Mortgage and asset-backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell (liquidity risk). They are also subject to credit, market and interest rate risks. Collateralized loan obligations carry additional risks such as the Fund may invest in CLOs that are subordinate to other classes and the complex structure may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results. When-Issued Securities, Delayed Delivery Securities, TBAs and Forward Commitments. These investments may result in a form of leverage and may increase volatility in the Fund\u2019s share price. They are subject to risks such as failure of the counterparty to perform its obligation to deliver the security, the characteristics of a security delivered to the Fund may be less favorable than expected and the security the Fund buys will lose value prior to its delivery. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition, if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments, the strategy could sustain a loss. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the portfolio, such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). High yield securities (\"junk bonds\") are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Foreign securities are subject to currency, political, economic and market risks. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. In emerging countries, these risks may be more significant. The portfolio may engage in active and frequent trading of its portfolio securities. A high portfolio turnover rate could result in high brokerage costs and an increase in taxable capital gains distributions. Preferred securities are subject to interest rate risk and generally decreases in value if interest rates rise and increase in value if interest rates fall. Active Management Risk. In pursuing the Fund\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use. For example, the Adviser, in its discretion, may determine to use some permitted trading strategies while not using others. The success or failure of such decisions will affect the Fund\u2019s performance. Participant Concentration Risk. The Portfolio has a limited number of intermediaries that act as authorized participants and none of these authorized participants is or will be obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. As a result, shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. Trading Risk. The market prices of Shares are expected to fluctuate, in some cases materially, in response to changes in the Portfolio's NAV, the intra-day value of holdings, and supply and demand for Shares. The Adviser cannot predict whether Shares will trade above, below or at their NAV. Buying or selling Shares in the secondary market may require paying brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers. Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss.\n\nEaton Vance, Parametric and Calvert are part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the asset management division of Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. is the adviser to the ETFs.\n\nETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services LLC.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240614288185/en/\n\nContacts\n\nMedia Relations Contact: Lauren Bellmare\r\nLauren.Bellmare@MorganStanley.com\n\nView comments",

In 2022, rival Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and its securities unit were penalized after the Financial Services Agency found that the latter had engaged in stock market manipulation.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. has already lost business following the reports.

        "content": "Among the coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list, the financial sector is starting to stand out at the moment with 44 of these 230 highly ranked stocks being finance companies.\n\nMore intriguing, several of these top finance stocks have dividend yields over 3%, and here are two to consider.\n\nMacro Bank BMA\n\nAs a leading bank in Argentina, Macro Bank checks in with a 4.89% annual dividend yield that towers over the S&P 500\u2019s 1.36% average and tops the Zacks Banks-Foreign Industry average of 3.48%. Furthermore, inflation in Argentina has cooled to its lowest levels since 2022 and soaring EPS estimates reflect Macro Bank being a winner of a strengthening economic cycle with its stock climbing over +100% year to date but still trading at just 5X forward earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMorgan Stanley MS\n\nFavorable changes in the macroeconomic environment have strengthened Morgan Stanley\u2019s outlook leading to increased probability for the leading financial investment services bank. With Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock sitting on +2% gains this year more upside looks very likely as annual earnings are expected to climb 25% in fiscal 2024 to $6.83 per share versus $5.46 a share last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to jump another 13% with MS trading at a reasonable 14X forward earnings multiple. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe cherry on top, especially for longer-term investors is Morgan Stanley\u2019s 3.55% annual dividend yield which tops its Zacks Financial-Investment Bank Industry average of 2.08%. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley's annualized dividend growth rate over the last five years is a very impressive 29.33% and its 59% payout ratio indicates there is plenty of room to increase its yield down the line.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nConsidering their generous dividends now appears to be an ideal time to buy these highly ranked finance stocks as they are benefiting from strong business environments. To that point, Macro Bank's Zacks Banks-Foreign Industry and Morgan Stanley's Financial-Investment Bank Industry are in the top 20% of almost 250 Zacks industries.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Today, we will explore three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks challenging Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), each poised with distinct strengths and growth potential for investors. With its cutting-edge GPUs and AI hardware, Nvidia has become the dominant force in the AI space. As a result, NVDA shares are up over 150% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAccording to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65% of organizations have embraced generative AI, nearly doubling adoption rates in the past ten months. As the AI ecosystem evolves, numerous companies are emerging as strong competitors. With the global AI market projected to surge at a compound\u00a0annual growth\u00a0rate (CAGR) of over 35% from 2024 to 2030, opportunities are boundless. If you are looking for AI stocks challenging Nvidia, these three picks could be your ticket to generous returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe first pick among AI stocks challenging Nvidia is ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the world\u2019s largest producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Dutch company dominates the market in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, essential for advanced semiconductor nodes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, in the first quarter of 2024, ASML\u2019s revenue dropped 22% year-over-year (YOY) to 5.3 billion euros, with net bookings at 3.6 billion euros compared to 3.8 billion euros in the previous year. Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter also declined by 37% YOY to 3.11 euros, reflecting the impact of weaker-than-expected sales on profitability.\n\nManagement sees 2024 as a transition year, investing in capacity and technology for an anticipated market recovery. Key customers are likely to upgrade their systems in 2025. Analysts highlight ASML\u2019s significant AI exposure in Europe, predicting a major increase in AI-related bookings next year.\n\nFitch Ratings has upgraded ASML\u2019s long-term issuer default rating to A+ from A. The report cited ASML\u2019s market dominance, technological leadership in EUV tools and strong cash flow despite industry risks.\n\nSince January, ASML stock has returned over 40%. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.3x and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 14.6x. Wall Street maintains a favorable outlook, with a 12-month median price forecast of $1,076 for ASML, implying a 2% upside potential.

It emerges as a leading player in high-speed networking, providing cutting-edge solutions for modern digital infrastructure. Broadcom maintains a stronghold in custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) as one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 12,\u00a0Broadcom reported consolidated net revenue of $12.5 billion for the second quarter, a 43% increase year over year. Excluding the contribution from the VMware acquisition, revenue was up 12%. Management noted that Broadcom was making strong progress in integrating VMware and accelerating its growth.\n\nBroadcom has demonstrated significant organic growth, leveraging robust AI momentum through its diverse product range. As a result, revenues from AI was very strong at over $11 billion. The company stands to benefit from increased capital expenditure by major cloud giants. Meanwhile, management raised its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to $51 billion. Finally, Broadcom announced a 10-for-1 stock split. This move could make the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, potentially increasing demand.\n\nInvestors are pleased that Broadcom has expanded its partnership with Google Cloud. According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Broadcom recently won a lucrative contract with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for its next-gen ASIC chips.\n\nSo far this year, AVGO stock has gained nearly 35% and offers a 1.3% dividend yield. Shares are trading at 30.7 times forward earnings and 16.2 times sales.

Net income surged 20% year over year to $21.9 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s Azure cloud platform has been a key driver of growth, with revenue growing by 31% YOY. Microsoft is leveraging this growth to introduce AI-as-a-service features on Azure, capitalizing on the demand for AI solutions. Wall Street highlights that Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0partnership with OpenAI underscores its growth potential by integrating OpenAI\u2019s technology into its products.\n\nYTD, MSFT stock is up more than 16%.

Her Morena party obtained more support in Congress than investors expected, fueling concerns that lawmakers, whose terms start in September, will push through AMLO\u2019s package of reforms even before she takes office in October.\n\nThe president stressed that the peso had strengthened during his time in office, unlike under the presidents before him, and said that Mexico\u2019s public finances were in good condition. He met with Sheinbaum on Monday to discuss their transition plan, which left investors anxious for more information about the timeline for the proposed reform.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Food Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices Legacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick said Monday that higher-for-longer interest rates are \"good for business.\"\n\n\"I do think it's really good for our business, because we have spent so much time refining the strategy,\" Pick said at a financial services conference hosted by Morgan Stanley Research. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nCentral bank policy makers have been cautioning investors to expect rates to remain elevated following a string of sticky inflation readings during the first quarter and surprisingly strong economic data.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected this Wednesday to keep rates at a 23-year high and dial back the number of cuts they expect for the remainder of 2024.\n\nThe current rate path presents a conundrum for many banks that rely heavily on the spread between what they pay for deposits and earn from their loans, or for banks that are heavily exposed to certain types of troubled borrowers.\n\nBut Pick said Morgan Stanley\u2019s strategy developed by his predecessor James Gorman protects the firm from the risks of an elevated rate environment.\n\n\"We know we don't do unsecured credit in emerging markets, credit cards through a loan cycle,\" he said. \"These are great businesses, but we know [what] we do and that's why it\u2019s so important, the discipline that James crystalized.\"\n\nPick became CEO at the beginning of this year after Gorman announced his decision to retire, making it clear Gorman\u2019s blueprint would remain in place. James Gorman, the last CEO of Morgan Stanley. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"While there has been a change in leadership, there is no change in strategy,\" he wrote in his 2024 letter to shareholders.\n\nSince that time, Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock has risen just 3%, underperforming its big Wall Street rivals. Its stock was roughly flat Monday.\n\nProfits last quarter rose more than analysts expected from the year ago period thanks to pickups in fees for investment banking, trading and asset management.\n\nFees from investment banking rose 19% from a year ago, driven most by more equity and fixed income underwriting transactions for work on IPOs and corporate bond issuance.\n\nPick on Monday pointed to better integration of Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment banking, trading, wealth and asset management as the key place for the firm\u2019s future growth.\n\nHe highlighted Morgan Stanley\u2019s business of stock plan administration for corporate clients as a way to engage with other divisions of the firm like investment banking.\n\nPick also discussed how artificial intelligence would boost Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment bank revenues.\n\n\"There's an enormous flywheel of activity,\" he said, pointing to clients in the utilities, telecommunication, real estate and technology sectors who will face more demand as the trend takes off.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley has a set of artificial intelligence products it offers clients within its wealth and asset management division known as AI at Morgan Stanley (AIMS). Some of the firm\u2019s products may already save its financial advisors ten to 15 hours per week, according to Pick.\n\nMorgan Stanley and other big banks are waiting this year for a final ruling on new capital requirements that were initially proposed nearly a year ago.\n\nExecutives now anticipate the final requirements to be less onerous than the initial proposal. That may mean banks will be freer to return to shareholders some of the excess capital they are currently holding.\n\nWithout saying what the firm plans to do, Pick admitted he loved dividends as a way of rewarding shareholders.\n\n\"I really care about the dividend as a stockholder\u2026 I think it is emblematic of our strength, of our stability\u2026so that\u2019s sacrosanct,\" he said, adding that investments to grow the firm along with stock buybacks were also possible uses of excess capital.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 4.17% since the start of the year. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.85 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.5% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.74% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.58%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 29.33%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Morgan Stanley's payout ratio is 59%, which means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nMS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.83 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 25.09%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that MS is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Dividend stocks are not on everyone\u2019s radar right now, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) moving past Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world. And, a host of other artificial intelligence stocks, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) lead the pack for mega-cap stocks. But with a potential recession this year and no rate cuts thus far, dividend stocks are the safe haven investment you need in your portfolio.\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is concerned about the 2024 economy, citing macroeconomic volatility and fundamental inflation pressures even if inflation falls to 2%. Moreover, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Morningstar analysts wrote that the U.S. equities market is overpriced after a significant gain by the end of 2023, and this was before Nvidia\u2019s surge this year.\n\nIn these times, it\u2019s better to pick up dividend aristocrat stocks analysts love, whose payouts have increased for 25 years and counting. Overall, the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat stocks have done better than the S&P 500 Index. Especially during a decade when average yearly stock returns were less than 10%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCardinal Health (CAH) Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) recently decided to increase its dividend to $0.5056 per share, helping maintain its 35-year dividend aristocrat streak. With this raise, the forward yearly dividend will be $2.02, giving CAH a forward yield of 2.05%, which is higher than the average yield in the healthcare sector of 1.58%. A payout ratio of 26% means the dividend is more than secure.\n\nIn addition, CAH\u2019s second-quarter $250 million accelerated share buyback program brought fiscal 2024 share repurchases to $750 million.\n\nApart from the shareholder returns, the healthcare services company deserves credit for navigating some tricky waters. It recently reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS forecasts despite its decision not to renew its contracts with OptumRx when they expire at the end of June 2024. Instead, CAH believes new customer wins and niche growth will make up for any revenue loss.\n\nRecent numbers support this. Cardinal Health\u2019s fiscal year 2024 third-quarter sales grew 9% to $54.9 billion, and CAH boosted its full-year non-GAAP EPS estimate. At-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics drove its Other business segment, which rose 14%.\n\nThe business is also expanding its network and delivery hubs to fulfill the demand for $2.6 billion in at-home solutions and is looking to create a larger Texas distribution facility with robots and modern technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince its founding, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has paid a cash payout every year, and since 1933, it has increased its dividends for 30 years; with a payout ratio of around 23%, CAT has a sustainable dividend model\n\nCaterpillar earned $5.75 per share in Q1 2024, or $5.60 after adjustments. Company revenues and earnings stayed at $15.8 billion from Q1 2023. The operational profit ratio improved from 17.2% to 22.3%, and operating cash flow was $2.1 billion, with $5.1 billion for buybacks and incentives.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s Cat Financial revenues grew 11% to $853 million owing to higher average lending rates and earning assets. Profit rose 12% to $229 million pre-tax. New retail business surged, and past-due accounts fell, showing a strong Cat Financial portfolio.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s success is due to its agile operating strategy and a strong housing market. Starting in April 2024, 1.36 million privately held homes were seasonally adjusted, 5.7% higher than in March 2024. April 2024 had 1.62 million housing completions, 8.6% higher than March and 14.6% more than April 2023. Active listings show increasing home prices owing to low housing availability.\n\nWith potentially three rate cuts this year, all of these statistics are great news for CAT investors.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSince going public in 1994, Realty Income (NYSE:O) has increased dividends 125 times, with a 2.1% increase to $0.2625 per share, the latest of its hikes.\n\nDue to its increasing dividend, paid monthly, O boasts a 5.8% yield, which is substantial even considering its REIT status and beats the real estate industry average of 4.5%.\n\nAfter raising its AFFO outlook to $4.15\u2013$4.21 per diluted share from $4.13\u2013$4.21, O offered investors another reason to be hopeful.\n\nO needs market trust following a lackluster earnings report. A market already suffering from rising interest rates was further soured by EPS falling over 40% short of expert estimates. However, a $129.7 million net income and $862.9 million AFFO for the first quarter of 2024 were still encouraging. Rent hikes and occupancy rates were maintained as the corporation invested $598 million at a 7.8% cash return.\n\nRealty Income made initial cash yield investments in various property sectors totaling $598 million during the quarter. At an average cap rate of 7%, O has completed $1.67 billion in acquisitions.\n\nThe results arrive shortly after Realty Income closed on its purchase of Spirit Realty Capital for $9.3 billion, adding 61.6 million square feet to the portfolio, becoming the fourth-largest REIT in the process.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "BOSTON, June 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eaton Vance Municipal Bond Fund (NYSE American: EIM) (the \"Fund\") announced today the commencement of a cash tender offer (the \"Tender Offer\").\n\nAs previously announced, the Fund will purchase for cash up to 20% of its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98% of its net asset value (\"NAV\") per share, determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on the day the Tender Offer expires. The Tender Offer will expire on July 9, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time or on such later date to which the offer is extended. If the number of common shares tendered exceeds the maximum amount of a Tender Offer, the Fund will purchase shares from tendering shareholders on a pro-rata basis (disregarding fractional shares). Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Fund will purchase all of a shareholder's tendered common shares in connection with the Tender Offer. The Fund may determine not to accept shares tendered in the Tender Offer under various circumstances, as set forth in the offering materials.\n\nThe Fund may sell portfolio instruments during the pendency of its Tender Offer to raise cash for the purchase of common shares. Thus, it is likely that during the pendency of the Tender Offer, and possibly for a short time thereafter, the Fund will hold a greater than normal percentage of its net assets in cash and cash equivalents. This larger cash position may interfere with the Fund\u2019s ability to meet its investment objectives and invest consistent with its investment strategy.\n\nThe Tender Offer is being made on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Fund\u2019s tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other offer documents) that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). All of these documents contain important information about the Tender Offer. Shareholders of the Fund should read the documents carefully as they contain important information about the Tender Offer. Shareholders of the Fund can obtain a free copy of the documents at the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov or from the Fund by calling EQ Fund Solutions, LLC, the Fund\u2019s information agent for the tender offer, at (877) 732-3614.\n\nThis press release is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the Fund and is not a prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase or sale of Fund shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout the Fund\n\nExcept for sales of shares pursuant to a tender offer, common shares of the Fund are available for purchase or sale only through secondary market trading at their current market price. Shares of closed-end funds (such as the Fund) often trade at a discount from their NAV. The market price of Fund shares may vary from NAV based on factors affecting the supply and demand for shares, such as Fund distribution rates relative to similar investments, investors\u2019 expectations for future distribution changes, the clarity of the Fund\u2019s investment strategy and future return expectations, and investors\u2019 confidence in the underlying markets in which the Fund invests. Fund shares are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of principal invested. Fund shares are not FDIC-insured and are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any bank. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Before investing in the Fund, prospective investors should carefully consider the Fund\u2019s investment objective, strategies, risks, charges and expenses.\n\nEaton Vance is part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley Investment Management\n\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management, together with its investment advisory affiliates, has more than 1,300 investment professionals around the world and $1.5 trillion in assets under management or supervision as of March 31, 2024.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, indicating a change of +33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.1%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.72 indicates a change of +13% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.1%. The $57.84 billion and $60.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.8% and +4.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $15.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. EPS of $2.02 for the same period compares with $1.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.6%. The EPS surprise was +19.53%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SNAP vs. PINS: Why I Think Pinterest Stock Is Better",
        "content": "In this article, I\u2019ll delve deeper to explain why I have a neutral stance on Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and a bullish outlook on Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). Within the social media sphere, Snap and Pinterest stand out as two companies with distinct positioning and strategies, yet both have demonstrated robust growth in user bases and revenues in recent years. Despite both stocks enjoying strong share performance over the past 12 months, PINS appears to be better positioned, in my view.\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP)\n\nThe Santa Monica, California-based Snap\u00a0Inc.\u00a0is the developer of the Snapchat platform, a social media platform known for its predominantly young audience, with nine out of 10 teenagers and young adults between the ages of 13 and 24 using the platform. Ads constitute Snap\u2019s primary source of revenue, with the company monetizing users through advertising. Additionally, Snap generates revenue from its hardware device, Spectacles, and offers a premium subscription model called Snapchat+, providing users with additional features.\n\nWhen examining the price chart for SNAP stock over the past six years, one might question why the company experienced significant growth in 2020 and a substantial decline since 2021 (down more than 80% from its peak).\n\nThe stock surged from $17 per share at its IPO in 2017 to its all-time high of $83 in September 2021. This remarkable increase\u00a0was propelled\u00a0by the company\u2019s exceptional financial performance in its initial years as a publicly traded company, coupled with a strong bull market in that period. In 2021, Snap reported revenues of $4.1 billion compared to $850 million during its IPO year, achieving profitability for the first time in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nDespite the impressive financial metrics and robust growth in daily active users (DAUs) during this relatively fast period, the euphoria surrounding SNAP stock led to\u00a0it being traded\u00a0at a market value exceeding $130 billion despite generating just over $4 billion in annual revenues and not yet turning a yearly profit.\n\nHowever, in 2022, amid adverse market conditions characterized by high inflation and rising interest rates, many tech and growth stocks, including Snap, experienced a significant downturn. Snap also faced\u00a0challenges such as\u00a0declining ad spending, resulting in stock price volatility after earnings reports.\n\nWhile Snap\u2019s performance over the last 12 months has shown gains of around 45%, the company continues to face volatility. This is evidenced by the mixed reactions to its Q4-2023 and Q1-2024 earnings reports, as depicted by the sharp decline and sharp rebound in the chart below.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Snap experienced a strong negative reaction in Q4 after reporting modest revenue growth and failing to meet market expectations, the company rebounded in Q1 by surpassing revenue expectations. Revenue grew by 21% year-over-year, and daily active user (DAU) numbers increased by 10% year-over-year. Additionally, other metrics, such as the number of Snapchat+ subscribers, more than tripled to over nine million subscribers in Q1 compared to the previous year.\n\nAnother point of concern is that much of Snap\u2019s growth trajectory has been financed through leverage, even though it paid down about $440 million in the past 12 months. Currently, the company\u2019s balance sheet carries a substantial amount of total debt of $3.89 billion despite its ability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2023, Snap had a 70% debt-to-assets ratio, which is the highest in history and significantly higher than that of its peers, especially Pinterest.\n\nLooking ahead,\u00a0I believe Snap is well-positioned for a more consistent trajectory, unlike its tumultuous past.\u00a0The company stands to benefit from increased ad spending as the economy enters a higher growth phase. However, concerns remain regarding Snap\u2019s valuation, with the company trading at a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of 57.8x, well above the industry average of 7x, and an EV/sales ratio of 5x, well above the 1.2x industry average.\n\nGiven these circumstances, a stretched valuation is the primary reason why Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak has a bearish stance on Snap. Despite the company\u2019s strong performance in the recent quarter, characterized by significant improvements in purchase conversions from brand advertising, Nowak advises caution. He suggests that investors should refrain from overreacting to the beat in Q1 or the revenue guidance for Q2, which implies a modest 1% year-over-year increase.\n\nIs SNAP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTaking into account Nowak\u2019s bearish stance, along with assessments from other Wall Street analysts, the consensus rating on SNAP is Hold. The stock has eight Buys, 18 Holds, and two Sell ratings. The average SNAP stock price target stands at $15.59, suggesting modest upside potential of 2.6%.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS)\n\nThe San Francisco-based social media company Pinterest\u00a0focuses on a different target audience\u00a0compared to\u00a0Snap.\u00a0Its core demographic consists of women with purchasing power, although the platform has been working to expand its user base and enhance its advertising capabilities. Additionally, Pinterest emphasizes shoppable features like direct links and advanced ad measurement tools.\n\nThe company primarily generates revenue through advertising, offering various ad formats such as Promoted Pins and Shopping Ads and enabling businesses to reach relevant audiences on the platform. Pinterest also features a \u201cbuy it\u201d button, allowing users to purchase pinned products directly, potentially generating revenue through commissions from partner merchants, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nWhen it comes to the company\u2019s stock performance, PINS\u2019 performance over the past four years has followed a comparable trajectory to SNAP. The stock experienced a significant rise in 2020, reaching an all-time high of $89 in February 2021, driven by strong financial performance and user growth. However, the market downturn in 2022 led to a drawdown of almost 80%.\n\nIn the last two years, Pinterest shares have performed well, rising nearly 100%, with the company focusing on cost control and improving its bottom-line losses. Pinterest boasts a\u00a0strong\u00a0financial position, with low debt levels and\u00a0rising\u00a0free cash flow compared to peers, including Snap. Its debt-to-free-cash-flow ratio stands at 0.7x, and in 2023, the company\u2019s debt-to-assets ratio was 14%. This positions Pinterest for greater revenue growth and user acquisition.\n\nLooking ahead,\u00a0Pinterest\u2019s partnership with Amazon and its focus on shoppability and full-funnel advertising\u00a0can be seen\u00a0as growth catalysts.\u00a0For the full year 2024, revenue\u00a0growth is expected to reach 15%.\u00a0Despite trading at a forward EV/EBITDA of 26.4x, which is stretched compared to the industry average, it is nearly half that of Snap. On the other hand, the company seems overvalued based on the EV/sales metric, as Pinterest trades at 8x sales compared to Snap\u2019s 5x multiple.\n\nOther important points supporting the potential for growth and appreciation in Pinterest\u2019s shares include key factors cited by BMO Capital analyst Brian J. Pitz, who is one of the Pinterest bulls. These factors include the improvement of the platform\u2019s international monetization through a partnership with Google Ads Manager and greater small-business adoption with new product launches (including generative AI features). Additionally, management aims to increase revenues in the mid-teens over the next three to five years.\n\nIs PINS Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCurrently, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that PINS stock is a Moderate Buy based on 15 Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. The average PINS stock price target is $46.28, implying upside potential of 8.3%.\n\nThe Verdict: Neutral on SNAP, Bullish on PINS\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards Pinterest having stronger fundamentals than Snap right now. Pinterest seems to have less to prove, even though its valuation is far from a bargain. The premium EV/sales multiple is more justified based on the better quality of its fundamentals.\n\nWhile both companies are well-positioned for growth and likely to be long-term winners, I see Snap\u2019s performance as highly susceptible to inconsistency. This stems from its struggle to turn a profit and potentially stretched valuation multiple, leading to negative reactions.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "RIVN vs.\u00a0LCID:\u00a0Which EV Stock Is the Better Pick?",
        "content": "Electric vehicle manufacturers Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) were once at the forefront of significant hype in the automotive industry back in 2021. However, the situation has drastically changed since then. Both stocks have plummeted by about 90% over the past three years. In this article, I\u2019ll delve deeper into these companies and explain why I hold a bullish outlook for Rivian and a bearish outlook for Lucid.\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nThe Irvine, California-based Rivian is an electric vehicle manufacturer that focuses on creating rugged, hip, and eco-friendly vehicles.\u00a0Currently, Rivian offers two\u00a0primary\u00a0consumer vehicles: the R1T (a pickup truck) and the R1S (an electric SUV). By 2023, the company had produced over 57,000 electric\u00a0vehicles\u00a0and successfully delivered more than 50,000 of them.\n\nRivian has raised significant funding from big names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford (NYSE:F), and it\u2019s been growing rapidly, with plans to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon. Rivian has also been working on a new vehicle \u201cskateboard\u201d platform that could support future vehicles or be adopted by other companies.\n\nAs recently reported in its first-quarter earnings at the beginning of May, one of the main highlights was announcing a strategic shift by unveiling its new R2 model. This medium-sized, low-cost vehicle will start at $45,000, making it competitive with Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y and priced much lower than the R1. This seems to be an essential step towards a better cost-per-vehicle conversion, as well as a good strategy for increasing its market reach in the face of fierce competition in this space.\n\nFurthermore, with the new model, Rivian hopes that lowering its conversion cost per vehicle in the second half of 2024 should lead the company to finally report a net profit in the fourth quarter of 2024, which could prove to be a near-term catalyst for the stock.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Rivian continues to face significant financial challenges, particularly its high cash burn rate. To illustrate the extent of this issue, in the most recent quarter, Rivian reported nearly $6 billion in cash and equivalents, a significant decrease from the $11.7 billion reported in the same period the previous year.\n\nYet, the $1.2 billion in revenues generated in the first quarter of the year, combined with a loss from operations of $1.48 billion, is not good. This is especially true when considering that the loss from operations did not evolve compared to the same period last year when Rivian lost $1.43 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, Rivian is still at a stage where it is growing revenues but has not yet managed to improve its operating losses, which raises a yellow flag. So much so that over the last 12 months, Rivian has lost around 20% of its market value.\n\nBut even with the seemingly endless bearish momentum since its IPO, it\u2019s still hard to say that Rivian is a cheap stock, although now it\u2019s much easier to make that case than in recent years. Rivian trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.2x, more than double the auto industry average of 0.80x and higher than that of Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD (OTC:BYDDY), NIO (NYSE:NIO), and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), which trade below 2x. However, it is about a third of the P/S ratio that Tesla traded at in the past 12 months.\n\nIs RIVN Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAmong the 20 Wall Street analysts who have covered Rivian in the last three months, the general consensus is predominantly bullish, resulting in a Moderate Buy rating. The average RIVN stock price target is $13.89, indicating upside potential of 18.3%.\n\nOne standout among these bulls is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jones, who believes Rivian is uniquely positioned beyond Tesla in the market to scale an integrated software stack critical to reaping rewards in AI. It can do so while it has a \u201cmarket value 1/60th that of Tesla.\u201d\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nUnlike Rivian, Newark, California-based Lucid Motors is an electric vehicle maker that focuses on luxury electric sedans and SUVs. Lucid Motors has one main consumer vehicle, the Lucid Air, which the company sold 4,369 units of in 2023.\n\nAs\u00a0Lucid concentrates on producing high-priced models with superior technology, the company\u00a0places a strong emphasis on quality.\u00a0The first Lucid Air model (the top-of-the-line Lucid model)\u00a0boasted\u00a0an impressive range of 520 miles on a single charge, making it the longest-range EV rated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nLucid is also working on a new electric SUV model called the Lucid Gravity, which should be launched in December of this year and will be priced at less than $80,000. In addition to the Gravity SUV program, Lucid has also announced that it plans to introduce mid-sized vehicles that should begin production at the end of 2026, representing a significant step for it to expand its addressable market.\n\nBut while Lucid sales are still modest (to say the least), all these developments and expectations come at a huge price. To fund its operations, the luxury EV manufacturer relies mainly on the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, which has been a loyal and long-term backer. In 2024, Lucid raised $1 billion, dedicated especially to producing its new SUV, the Gravity.\n\nEven though Lucid has solid financial stability today, thanks to the PIF funding, the company faces significant sustainability challenges in the niche luxury EV market. In its most recent quarter, Lucid disclosed a cost per vehicle of about $200,000 based on nearly 2,000 deliveries and a cost of revenues totaling $404.8 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company reported a net loss of $680.9 million in Q1 2024, translating to a net loss of approximately $345,000 per vehicle. These results indicate underwhelming production and sales growth despite modest increases.\n\nBy the end of Q1, Lucid had $3.99 billion in total cash and short-term investments and a free cash flow of negative $714.9 million. If the company continues to burn cash at these levels by the middle of next year, it will come close to running out of cash.\n\nThis lack of sustainability has significantly impacted Lucid Motors\u2019 market capitalization, which was valued at $90.9 billion in November 2021 but has since plummeted to around $6.4 billion. The primary concern is that even at a much-discounted historical valuation, there is still no justification for the company\u2019s valuation multiples. Lucid trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10.4x, nearly double Tesla\u2019s multiple and five times that of Rivian.\n\nIs LCID Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus on Wall Street regarding Lucid shows prevailing skepticism, as six out of eight analysts covering the stock in the last three months have given it a Hold rating. The average LCID stock price target among these analysts is $3.16 per share, indicating upside potential of 13.3%.\n\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce is one of the skeptics. Although he recognizes Lucid\u2019s best-in-class technology and leading efficiency, he notes that the company\u2019s low delivery numbers limit fixed cost absorption and increasingly require capital injections.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nAlthough EV stocks, in general, have been experiencing bearish momentum recently, I have a bullish view of Rivian and a bearish one of Lucid.\n\nBoth Rivian and Lucid face significant challenges in making their business operations truly sustainable, as recent results show they are still burning substantial amounts of cash.\n\nHowever, I consider Rivian to be a better pick due to its closer proximity to achieving sustainability compared to Lucid, primarily because Rivian has a broader market presence and trades at a much more reasonable valuation.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Access to financial advisors linked to retirement planning remains high priority Retirement and financial planning support top list of retirement benefits employees think will help them meet financial goals Companies recognize that employees need additional retirement planning support\n\nNEW YORK, June 06, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley at Work today released results from its fourth annual State of the Workplace Financial Benefits Study, which demonstrate that employees once again voted retirement planning support and financial guidance top of their list for most-wanted financial benefits. Results indicate that amid an uncertain economic climate, employees are reducing plan contributions, yet at the same time seeking financial guidance from workplace resources. The ability for employers to meet employee needs and expectations around retirement support prevails as a key factor in talent attraction and retention.\n\nKey findings from the data include:\n\nRetirement guidance and financial guidance top the list of must-haves: Retirement preparation assistance is the top choice for employees, followed by help with financial planning and goals-based retirement investment planning. For HR leaders, goals-based retirement investment planning comes first, followed closely by access to a financial planner and retirement planning tools and calculators. In fact, both employees and HR leaders alike rank access to a financial advisor among their top-three choices for the most beneficial retirement planning assistance. Employees are accelerating financial planning efforts: Even as economic conditions improve and fewer employees say financial stress is negatively affecting their work and personal life (a four percentage point decrease since 2023), nearly 8 in 10 (78%) still feel pressure to accelerate their financial planning to help make up for lost time\u2014emphasizing the continued importance of comprehensive and long-term support through financial benefits like retirement. Retirement plan participants value guidance even more highly: Employees who participate in their company 401(k)s are more likely than the general population to say that they need financial investment planning support (77% vs. 68%). They are also more likely to feel the need to accelerate their financial planning to make up for lost time (82% vs. 72% who don\u2019t participate). In fact, retirement planning assistance from professionals is so important to retirement participants that 63% say it is a top or high priority when choosing where to work. Employees are cutting back on contributions: Nearly two in three employees (63%) say they are still reducing contributions to their workplace financial accounts (nearly on par with 66% in 2023 and 62% in 2022) due to the economic environment. In fact, this year even more employees say they are reducing contributions to their 401(k) plans (36%, up three percentage points since 2023).\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our research continues to show that employees make better choices and engage more deeply with their retirement plans when they have access to financial education and guidance\u2014in turn driving business outcomes, such as attracting and retaining talent,\" said Jeremy France, Head of Institutional Consulting Solutions at Morgan Stanley. \"HR leaders and employees are equally invested in continuing to improve how companies can better assist their benefits participants. Plan sponsors, providers, advisors, and record keepers have a clear mission to continue to work together to find the right blend of retirement support, with education an essential ingredient.\"\n\nAdditional details are available in Morgan Stanley at Work\u2019s State of the Workplace Study here. As part of a series of findings from Morgan Stanley at Work\u2019s third annual study, the business will publish its findings on equity and financial benefits in the coming weeks.\n\nMethodology: The data from the Morgan Stanley at Work Employees Survey and HR Leaders Survey comes from a survey of 1,000 U.S.-employed adults and 600 HR leaders for companies by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com).\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley at Work\n\nMorgan Stanley at Work provides workplace financial benefits that build financial confidence and foster loyalty\u2014helping companies attract and retain top talent.

        "content": "The entertainment stocks are worth checking in on as they continue to roll with the punches of this inflationary environment. Undoubtedly, we\u2019re all sick and tired of inflation and its impact on our spending habits. The good news is inflation is on its way out. However, it may not be soon enough for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this summer.\n\nEither way, consumers will start splurging on themselves once they can rebuild their savings. Whether \u201cspaving\u201d (spending more money to take advantage of discounts) ends up in the driver\u2019s seat this summer as some firms backtrack on recent price increases remains to be seen.\n\nEntertainment is becoming more of a need than a want for today\u2019s crowd, many of whom value experiences. Here are three cheap entertainment plays that could stay hot in summer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, we have top-tier streamer Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which has a good chance of making new highs in the second half. At writing, NFLX stock is on a seemingly unstoppable run, soaring more than 57% in the past year alone. As it turned out, Netflix\u2019s pivot towards an ad-based tier has gone quite smoothly.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Benjamin Swinburne sees more good times ahead for the top streaming platform, with a \u201cbull case\u201d price target of $850. Specifically, Swinburne sees a big opportunity for Netflix in the \u201cscaling of its advertising business,\u201d\n\nNot only is Netflix continuing to excel at producing must-binge content regularly, but it\u2019s also on track to build on recent momentum in its ad-based tier. Netflix knows what we want to watch. As it learns more about us, it\u2019ll probably understand what products would also tempt us to buy.\n\nIndeed, don\u2019t bet against Netflix, as it\u2019s already proven to be a high-value entertainment subscription. This is even after countless price hikes and password-sharing crackdowns. Additionally, the recent postponement of the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match shouldn\u2019t be too big a deal for the coming quarter.\n\nLive Nation (LYV) Twitter account of popular US singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in Twitter website seen in iPhone on Live Nation (LYV) logo background. Selective focus\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nLive Nation (NYSE:LYV) has to be one of my favorite Millennial and Gen Z plays on the market right now. The company has a pretty wide moat around its share of the \u201cexperience\u201d market, and I don\u2019t think any credible challengers can narrow such a moat anytime soon. As long as big-name artists continue drawing in big crowds, I simply do not see LYV stock backtracking, especially from today\u2019s modest levels.\n\nLately, there have been some troubling negative headlines hitting Live Nation. From the recent Ticketmaster hack, which reportedly exposed data from 560 million users to a U.S. regulatory crackdown on Ticketmaster\u2019s \u201cmonopolistic practices,\u201d it certainly seems like a nail-biting time to be a shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn any case, the recent sag in the stock is more of a long-term buying opportunity for investors seeking exposure to an entertainment powerhouse. Recent setbacks could be an overhang for quite some time, but the long-term narrative remains as robust as ever. The stock is still down more than 25% from its early 2022 highs.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCL) Deck of a Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruise ship looking over the ocean\n\nSource: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) has been a shocking outperformer this year, with RCL stock surging over 25% year to date. With a fresh new all-time high in the record books, I wouldn\u2019t be so fast to jump ship on the name quite yet. Not as bookings continue flowing in after an imposing period of seasonal strength (so-called \u201cwave season\u201d). Sometimes, strength begets strength, and record breakers beget more record breakers.\n\nLooking back, management wasn\u2019t upbeat enough about booking demand for the coming sizzling summer travel season. While seasonality plays a major role in the cruise line plays, RCL stock is worth holding for the long haul as the premier cruise operator cuts back on debt and invests in growth initiatives.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps next year\u2019s booking boom may be even more pronounced as the king of cruising beckons travelers of all ages.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Stricter bank regulations have also fueled the growth of private credit as traditional lenders have stepped back from making smaller loans.\n\n\u201cThe core middle markets are still a natural place for private credit,\u201d Miller said.\n\nPrivate equity firms are evaluating current market prices and options, particularly for companies that aren\u2019t growing as strongly, said Matt Cwiertnia, head of private equity at Ares Management.\n\n\u201cPeople want money in the private equity business,\u201d Cwiertnia said. \u201cInvestors want money back, and I do think the drumbeat is getting louder for that. With that, I do think GPs like ourselves will be looking to sell assets and deal flow will pick up in the back half of 2024 and into 2025.\u201d\n\nHigher Rates\n\nOn the question of defaults, Hirschmann added that the rise in interest rates has been factored into private credit deals, and only those companies whose debt packages were arranged beforehand with high leverage levels of 6 to 8 times earnings, have been struggling to service debt levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nLondon-based investor Permira manages about \u20ac80 billion in assets across its buyout, growth equity and credit funds, according to its website. Ares oversees more than $308 billion in its credit group and $24.5 billion in private equity.\n\nMorgan Stanley IM manages around $48 billion across private credit and equity, split half-and-half, according to representatives for the firm.

Since 2009, Morgan Stanley\u2019s funding for Feeding America has totaled more than $50 million, helping to deliver more than 356 million meals1 to children and families. Additionally, Morgan Stanley employees have volunteered more than 130,000 hours for Feeding America food banks across the U.S.\n\n\"The Morgan Stanley Foundation has supported the Feeding America network of food banks for 15 years and counting as part of our core value of giving back and our longstanding commitment to children\u2019s health,\" said Joan Steinberg, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Global Head of Philanthropy and President of the Morgan Stanley Foundation. \"We are proud to build upon this partnership and continue to fund innovative solutions that reach communities across the country at risk of food insecurity.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s latest grant to Feeding America will support the following initiatives:\n\nChild and Family Hunger Grants: These grants will be used to expand child hunger programs, helping children and their families access food and resources where they are and when they need it most. This includes: mobile and school food pantry programs; BackPack, which discreetly offers families free groceries for weekends and school breaks; after-school, weekend and summer meal programs; and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) application assistance programs. Equitable Access Operational Response Plans (ORPs): These programs are a new way to improve equitable access to food among underserved populations. Selected food banks will develop and implement customized ORPs that target the people and communities most affected by food insecurity in their area. Programs address reported barriers, such as lack of awareness of food assistance options, social stigma, lack of transportation, discrimination, and dietary or cultural preferences.\n\n\"All communities and each person within them deserve the food they need and desire to thrive. Morgan Stanley\u2019s grants provide funding for programs that champion dignified and reliable access to nutritious food for people facing hunger while working to address barriers to support,\" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, CEO of Feeding America. \"We are deeply grateful for Morgan Stanley\u2019s long-term support for grassroots programs as well as the hours their employees have volunteered. Both advance our shared vision of a food-secure America.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new grant is being announced as Morgan Stanley kicks off its annual Global Volunteer Month, when employees across the world participate in thousands of volunteer projects to generate impact where they live and work. To launch this year\u2019s volunteer program, 300 employees will be gathering today in Times Square to pack meals for Food Bank For New York City.\n\nTo learn more about Morgan Stanley\u2019s giving back efforts, please see here.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services.

        "title": "3 Oversold Stocks to Buy Right Now While The Gettin\u2019 Is Good",
        "content": "May was a month of haves and have-nots. The markets reached all-time highs, defying the skeptics. However, the indices\u2019 action masked underlying carnage in several sectors, which has presented some oversold stocks to buy.\n\nLately, this has been a market of contrasts. Although impressive performances from stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the S&P 500 to the highest monthly close ever, breadth has been weak. Indeed, looking under the hood, many stocks are making three-month lows.\n\nIdiosyncratic factors have hit several industries. Software, for instance, has been a minefield as investors grapple with underwhelming guidance and the unknown disruption from AI. Meanwhile, energy stocks have declined due to falling oil prices, whereas consumer staples have declined as consumers begin pushing back on higher prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese three oversold stocks to buy have suffered as their industries face the abovementioned challenges. However, this is an opportunity, given their long-term track record and bargain valuations at current levels.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC) Paychex Flex app is seen in the App Store on an iPhone\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis week, software stocks were in the spotlight after Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported underwhelming results, leading to one of the worst daily declines ever in the sector. Unfortunately, Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), a human capital management platform, was also caught up in the selloff. The decline added to the losses the stock had experienced due to product rollout problems.\n\nHowever, the downturn in PAYC stock is overdone, and the stock is a bargain. Notably, the stock is over 70% below its October 2021 highs and is among the top oversold stocks to buy. The indiscriminate selling of software has created an opportunity for a highly profitable SAAS stock.\n\nNotably, the company has achieved over 30% annual revenue growth over nearly the past decade, excluding 2020. But in 2023, operational missteps in a product rollout led to 23% growth. Still, that\u2019s top-tier growth. Furthermore, the company has maintained operating margins above 20% and very high returns on invested capital.\n\nAs of this writing, the stock is trading at one of its lowest valuations. Although growth has slowed, management expects a respectable 10% to 11% revenue growth this year. They have also guided for $720 to $730 million in EBITDA, meaning the stock is trading at a forward EV/EBITDA of 11. Without a doubt, Paycom is just too cheap to ignore.\n\nHormel Foods (HRL) Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nInflation was a tailwind for food and snack companies. But now consumers are pushing back, causing volume declines. As a result, stocks like Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) have suffered, and it\u2019s one of the most oversold stocks to buy. No one should count out the maker of the iconic SPAM brand. It has a long track record of execution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid the uncertain consumer environment, management is working on strategic growth priorities. Already, these initiatives are bearing fruit. The food service segment had an impressive first half of the fiscal year 2024, with growing volume, net sales and segment profits. In Q2 2024, volumes grew by 3% and net sales by 6%.\n\nFurthermore, the company is investing in its brands to boost growth. A good example is increased advertising spending on the Planters Snack Nuts business, which it acquired from Kraft (NASDAQ:KHC) in 2021. Due to these brand-building and innovation efforts, the brand saw momentum in volume and sales growth.\n\nTaking it together, management will return this Dividend King to growth. For now, it\u2019s cheap. Management expects adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.55 to $1.65, which means that HRL stock trades at 20 times forward earnings. As a bonus, you earn a 3.65% dividend that stands out due to the 59 years of dividend growth.\n\nSchlumberger (SLB) slb stock\n\nSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil services giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported impressive results on April 19. However, the stock price declined in May due to weaker oil prices and has been down 7% over the past three months. If you are looking for oversold stocks to buy in energy, SLB stock fits the bill.\n\nClearly, the stock price has diverged from fundamentals, which presents an opportunity. In Q1 2024, revenues were $8.71 billion compared to $7.7 billion in Q1 2023, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA surged 15% to $2.06 billion.\n\nDue to the positive energy demand outlook, Schlumberger\u2019s business momentum continues. International and offshore operators need its equipment and services to boost production and reservoir recovery.\n\nAdditionally, the company is positioned to benefit from the focus on emission reductions. Through a combination with Aker Carbon Capture (OTCMKTS:AKCCF), it now has a proven platform with leading technology. These carbon capture and sequestration and lower-carbon technologies will be a source of future growth.\n\nAt a trailing EV/EBITDA multiple of 10x and a forward P/E ratio of 13, SLB stock is too cheap. Morgan Stanley\u2019s (NYSE:MS) Mike Wilson agrees and includes the stock in his high-quality growth list. In short, SLB is a bargain stock and also a hedge against geopolitical flare-ups or higher oil prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (MSDL) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (MSDL) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2024, this company is expected to earn $2.52 per share, which is a change of -5.6% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Bill Hwang Wants to Cite Morgan Stanley Leaks as Secrecy Defense",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bill Hwang is pushing to bring up the probe of Morgan Stanley block-trading leaks in an attempt to bolster his defense.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKey Engines of US Consumer Spending Are Losing Steam All at Once GameStop Shares Surge as Gill\u2019s Reddit Return Shows Huge Bet Mnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money Homebuyers Are Starting to Revolt Over Steep Prices Across US AMLO Protege Sheinbaum Becomes First Female President in Mexico\n\nLawyers for Hwang have asked the judge to be allowed to question a Securities and Exchange Commission official about the agency\u2019s investigation of Morgan Stanley. That probe was into information leaking in connection with the New York-based firm\u2019s block-trading practices during the time it was a counterparty of Archegos.\n\nProsecutors have relied on Carmen Taveras of the SEC as an expert witness as it tries to prove that Hwang engaged in market manipulation that helped catapult his wealth to more than $36 billion before losing it all in the span of a few days in March 2021. Morgan Stanley executed more than $5 billion of block trades for Archegos in the days before all the family office\u2019s counterparties pushed to liquidate Hwang\u2019s portfolio after the precipitous drop in the value of his biggest bets.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors have sought to paint Hwang\u2019s use of swaps as a deliberate attempt to quietly corner big positions in companies and manipulate the market for those stocks. Hwang, however, has described his reliance on such contracts as an attempt to avoid attracting public attention to his bets \u2014 to prevent other market participants from attacking his positions if his wagers became public.\n\n\u201cWe believe that such inquiry is relevant and necessary for the defense to establish the legitimate reasons why Mr. Hwang and Archegos sought to maintain the secrecy of their positions,\u201d Barry Berke, a lawyer for Hwang wrote in a letter to the judge overseeing the case. The aim would be to \u201crebut the implication of Dr. Taveras\u2019s testimony that Archegos used secrecy in order to facilitate manipulation.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors argued against the line of questioning, stating they\u2019d already told Hwang\u2019s lawyers that the block trades executed in Archegos\u2019 final week were not part of the investigation.\n\nA multi-year investigation into block trading across the industry culminated in January after Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $249 million to the Justice Department and the SEC. The probe faulted Morgan Stanley for giving hedge funds advance warning as clients planned to sell slugs of stock big enough to move market prices. The Justice Department and the SEC said bank employees doled out the information, with the expectation that hedge funds would short the stocks and position themselves to buy parts of a block once it hit the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nHwang\u2019s lawyers also cite a call recording produced by the prosecution that was obtained from the Morgan Stanley investigation where an executive at Citadel tells a Morgan Stanley banker \u201cyou took out Bill Hwang with the Viacom.\u201d\n\nThe Morgan Stanley executive replied: \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Israel Seeks Underground Secrets by Tracking Cosmic Particles How Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stock has experienced a significant rally in recent months, outperforming the broader financial sector. This upward momentum can be attributed to several factors, including their latest first-quarter earnings release.\n\nA rebound in deal flow in the IPO market has Wall Street extremely optimistic on the broader economy. Additionally, its strong earnings growth and inflows in its investment management division is another positive sign. Analysts remain optimistic about Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings growth outlook through 2025, driven by the company\u2019s strategic initiative and favorable market conditions. Investors seeking exposure to the financial sector might consider adding Morgan Stanley stock to their portfolios in 2024.\n\nRobust Earnings Growth\n\nMorgan Stanley stock reported impressive earnings growth in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing market expectations. The company\u2019s diversified business model proved resilient, with strong performance across its investment banking, wealth management and investment management segments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe investment banking division, in particular, benefited from a rebound in deal activity, boosting revenue growth. Investment banking revenue grew 16% from the year prior, largely driven by demand in initial public offerings.\n\nFurthermore, wealth management revenues increased 5% year over year (YOY) to $6.9 billion, with assets under management (AUM) swelling to $1.5 trillion. This robust earnings performance underscores Morgan Stanley\u2019s ability to navigate changing market conditions and deliver value for its shareholders.\n\nRebound in IPO Market Deal Flow\n\nThe IPO market has seen a notable resurgence in recent months and Morgan Stanley has been at the forefront of this trend. As a leading investment bank, the company has been involved in numerous high-profile IPOs.\n\nThis has generated the company substantial fees and revenue in the first quarter, and that trend could very well continue. The backdrop for the U.S. IPOs is improving driven by a number of factors.\n\nFirstly, there is a strong likelihood that interest rates and inflation may have peaked. At length, this could bolster IPO activity in the back half of 2024. Secondly, despite higher interest rates risk appetite is increasing with global stock markets returning to record levels.\n\nAdditionally, the global U.S. Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) data in May saw a slight rebound from April levels. Overall business conditions are improving, and this could add more fuel to Morgan Stanley\u2019s revenue and earnings growth in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Positive Outlook Now and In the Future\n\nMorgan Stanley stock showcased some significant improvements in its first quarter earnings release in 2024. The company is driving diversified growth, as inflation cools and risk appetite increases in the IPO market.\n\nTheir investment banking division is rebounding as the IPO market starts off 2024 on a strong note. While their growth will be contingent on less restrictive financial conditions, their earnings growth forecasts through 2025 remain positive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "S&P 500\u2019s robust performance in the first 100 days of 2024 suggests a bullish outlook for the remainder of the year, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts. As markets continue to grind higher, Wall Street analysts are actively issuing analyst upgrades, revisiting their research coverage to update ratings and reflect the optimistic market trends.\n\nAccording to BofA, when the S&P 500 rises more than 10% within the first 100 days, the index typically continues to perform well, with a 76% probability of further gains and an average return of 7.1%. The bank projects the S&P 500 could reach between 5640 and 5750 by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cWhen the SPX trades higher over the first 100 days of a Presidential election year, the rest of the year tends to be strong with the index up 93% on an average return of 10.1% (SPX 5800) and a median return of 8.9% (SPX 5730),\u201d the analysts said.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe markets hitting record highs come when hedge funds have started to sell U.S. equities at a rate not seen since early January. That marks a significant change after five consecutive weeks of net buying.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 (NYSE:GS) analysis indicates this selling trend aligns with recent positive economic growth signs and a firm stance from the Federal Reserve, suggesting that interest rates may remain elevated for an extended period. The sell-off was broad-based, affecting all 11 U.S. sectors.\n\nDespite the widespread declines, some stocks have shown remarkable resilience. Let\u2019s now look at the top three stocks that have soared following significant analyst upgrades.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMizuho analysts upgraded Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) from Neutral to Buy, raising the price target from $85.00 to $115.00. Rakesh noted that Microchip has faced significant challenges, with three consecutive quarters of declining top-line guidance and gross margins dropping from 68% to 60%.\n\nHowever, the analysts see potential for recovery as inventory levels begin to stabilize, potentially leading to improvements in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Despite concerns about OEMs shifting from MCU to Arm-based processors, Mizuho remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cWe believe MCHP could see tailwinds into 2025E with a cyclical recovery as MCUs and Analog supply chains improve,\u201d the upgrade report said.\n\nThe analyst believes Microchip could benefit from a cyclical recovery in the MCU and analog supply chains, justifying the upgrade to Buy and the increased price target. Analysts also raised their rating on NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI).\n\nStory continues\n\nDuPont de Nemours (DD) The logo for DuPont (DD).\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analysts issued significant upgrades for DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD), elevating it from Equal Weight to Overweight, with a price target increase from $80.00 to $103.00. The upgrade followed DuPont\u2019s announcement that it will split into three publicly traded companies while the current CEO is set to retire.\n\nThe bank highlighted DuPont\u2019s potential for consistent growth across economic cycles, which could drive multiple expansions \u2014 a challenging feat for diversified chemical companies. The analyst believes the company\u2019s new entities will support mid-to-high teen multiples, reflecting stronger valuation metrics.\n\nAlthough it might take two years to fully execute the planned transactions, Wells Fargo anticipates that volume growth for each business segment will accelerate early in an economic recovery. That acceleration typically results in outperformance for chemical companies, positioning DuPont favorably.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) executed one of the more notable analyst upgrades, moving Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) from Underweight to Equal Weight, raising the price target from $98.00 to $130.00. Morgan Stanley was the biggest and only bear on the Street among large banks before admitting it was wrong on the memory chipmaker.\n\nDespite viewing Micron as fundamentally overvalued based on long-term discounted cash flow metrics, the broker acknowledges the positive impact of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on market sentiment. That sentiment is driving sustained pricing strength, and analyst Joseph Moore anticipates a potential positive earnings preannouncement this quarter.\n\nWhile the outlook for Micron remains optimistic, the company has faced a significant challenge with a $445 million patent trial verdict in favor of Netlist (OTCMKTS:NLST). However, Micron continues focusing on its HBM product development and aims to secure a larger share of the growing AI and high-performance computing markets.\n\nAlthough there are concerns that HBM supply may eventually become excessive, the market is still in the ramp-up phase. Additionally, Morgan Stanley is incrementally bullish on NAND flash memory, citing robust capital spending, which should be a significant growth driver next year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

        "content": "Growth stocks are a great way to buy into a potential market bull run this year, should the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts occur. The Fed has hinted that rates could go down up to three times in 2024 from 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in 22 years. The markets are now looking to the next Fed meeting in June for more updates.\n\nIf the Fed does what is expected and earnings keep going up without the economy going into a slump, the stock market could have a broad-based bull market. Fourteen of the 20 biggest stock markets in the world have already notched record highs this year, with U.S. stocks currently on a $12 trillion rise.\n\nSo far, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are leading the charge. After slowing down in 2023, Fidelity thinks earnings growth will pick up again in 2024, helping sustain the bull market with more inclusive stock market gains across sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEveryone is buying NVDA stock, but as we shall see, there are solid growth stocks rated a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d have double-digit upsides, and have strong sales growth that are up for grabs. These growth stocks include a top e-commerce play with dominant cloud infrastructure, a cybersecurity firm with advanced security solutions, and an ambitious electric vehicle maker rapidly expanding its model line despite financial instability.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit a new record high in May, attributable to Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy\u2019s confidence in Amazon\u2019s abilities in generative AI and good Q1 earnings.\n\nThe upgraded Amazon Q now allows non-developers to build applications using natural language. AMZN also plans to add creative AI technologies to Alexa and charge a monthly subscription. At the same time, AWS Bedrock AI can now import and access custom AI models.\n\nIt\u2019s important that Amazon keep adding to AWS, which accounts for 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market and has a $100 billion annual revenue run rate, more than any other cloud provider. AWS generated 54% of Amazon\u2019s $13.21 billion operational profits in Q4 2023, representing 14% of Amazon\u2019s income.\n\nMoving away from AWS, Amazon has also signed multiple long-term deals with Seattle Kraken hockey games and NBA games to boost its Prime offering.\n\nOverall, on the retail side, Amazon is still getting a big chunk of new spending, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) experts say that the company is becoming even more competitive.\n\nAccording to the most recent report, the global e-commerce company made almost $576 billion in net sales, up from $514 billion the previous year, primarily from online retail sales; consensus points to a potential 21% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) operates in cybersecurity, an important part of the world economy that will grow by 11% from 2024 to 2028 and reach $273 billion in value by 2028; it holds about a 24% share of the endpoint protection market.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform continues to bring in new customers, as shown by the 34% year-over-year growth in yearly ongoing income revealed in the most recent earnings.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 earning-per-share was 95 cents, well over the expert expectation of 82 cents, and revenues were $845 million, higher than the $839 million predicted.\n\nOn the product side, CrowdStrike showed off its Falcon Next-Gen SIEM system for the first time at the RSA Conference 2024. CrowdStrike also put out Falcon for Defender, which protects Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Defender setups by constantly looking for risks.\n\nCrowdStrike and Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud are also working together more closely to improve AI-based hacking incident response and MDR using Falcon and Mandiant. In addition, CrowdStrike and NinjaOne are working together to offer full computer protection.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s revenue for 2024 was around $3 billion, 36% more than in 2023; consensus points to an around 16% upside, enhancing its appeal among growth stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car.

LI stock went up because the upscale electric SUV starts at $34,500. The price is relatively affordable within the premium electric SUV market, and the new model received over 10,000 orders within 72 hours of debuting.\n\nHowever, the stock is down 41% because Q1 2024 vehicle sales missed analyst estimates, and its electric SUV launch is delayed until the second half of 2025 due to infrastructure issues.\n\nAnalysts, however, expect a turnaround for the first major China EV startup to turn a profit, projecting an upside of 76%, making it can\u2019t miss among growth stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Equity Compensation Key Driver of Employee Retention and Engagement, Study Finds",
        "content": "Equity compensation gaining in popularity as more companies offer stock plan benefits Employees and HR leaders see equity compensation differently Despite progress, gaps remain in equity education and awareness\n\nNEW YORK, May 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley at Work today issued results from its fourth annual State of the Workplace Financial Benefits Study, showing that equity compensation continues to grow in demand among both employees and HR leaders alike, and at both public and private companies. While employers cite equity as the top driver of employee engagement and retention, opportunities remain to help employees better understand the financial opportunities available to them through equity ownership.\n\nKey findings from the study include:\n\nEquity compensation is growing in popularity across the board: More HR leaders report that their companies (76%) are offering some form of equity compensation benefits\u2014up four percentage points year-over-year and a 12-point increase since 2021 (65%). Equity compensation retains MVP status for driving employee engagement: Nearly all (95%) HR leaders say equity compensation is the most effective way to keep employees motivated and engaged, which has remained virtually unchanged year over year (97% in 2023, 95% in 2022, and 93% in 2021)\u2014and four in five employees agree (80%). Liquidity is a laser focus at private companies: Over three in five employees at private companies (62%) say the prospect of a future liquidity event or IPO is very or somewhat important to them. Liquidity events are even more top-of-mind for HR leaders, with 86% saying it\u2019s important to consider a liquidity event (such as a tender offer) in the coming 12-24 months\u2014and even more (88%) for an IPO. Employers more likely than employees to see long term value in equity compensation: Employees\u2019 perception of equity compensation as a long-term investment vehicle diminished over the past year (down six percentage points from 2023), highlighting the challenge in front of HR leaders\u2014who more firmly believe in the merits of equity compensation for meeting long-term investing goals such as retirement. This suggests more can be done to help employees understand and integrate their equity compensation into a comprehensive financial approach. And awareness and education gaps persist: Despite the growing demand and popularity of equity compensation, only 38% of employees say they are aware that their company offers these benefits, and less than half (45%) of both employees and HR leaders said their company\u2019s participant education program is very effective\u2014indicating important opportunities for improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The data shows that equity has become a key driver of retention, engagement, and value across the entire organization\u2014and one of the most powerful tools to sync employees with the success of their companies,\" said Kate Winget, Chief Revenue Officer of Morgan Stanley at Work. \"Equity plan engagement can have a direct impact on employee satisfaction and goodwill, whether it\u2019s through education programs, executive support, or collaborating with providers on plan management. Expanding participant eligibility, education, and access to liquidity events can be a game-changer for companies and their talent.\"\n\nAdditional details are available in Morgan Stanley at Work\u2019s State of the Workplace Study here. As part of a series of findings from Morgan Stanley at Work\u2019s fourth annual study, the business will also publish its findings on financial benefits and retirement benefits in the coming weeks.\n\nMethodology: The data from the Morgan Stanley at Work Employees Survey and HR Leaders Survey comes from a survey of 1,000 U.S.-employed adults and 600 HR leaders for companies. The survey was conducted on behalf of Morgan Stanley at Work using an email invitation and an online survey between February 5 and February 12, 2024, by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com).\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley at Work\n\nMorgan Stanley at Work provides workplace financial benefits that build financial confidence and foster loyalty\u2014helping companies attract and retain top talent.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at theleast feminist country in the world. If you wish to see our full list, please switch over to 20 Least Feminist Countries in the World.\n\nA Historic Milestone\n\nOn June 2nd, Mexico is set to witness what The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT) describes as a landmark election. It is expected to be the largest election in the nation\u2019s history, with an anticipated turnout of approximately 99 million voters, per The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT). However, what makes the election truly unprecedented is that Mexico is on the brink of electing its first-ever female president. According to The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT), both front runners in the election campaign are women, namely Claudia Sheinbaum and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. The imminent election of a female president in Mexico isn\u2019t an isolated event. Rather, it is part of a much larger global effort to not only challenge gender-based social and cultural inequities but also ensure that women can play a critical role in driving political and economic success.\n\nWomen-led Businesses\n\nPolitics isn\u2019t the only area where women have managed to secure high-level positions. Just a few years ago, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) appointed Jane Fraser as its CEO, marking it as the first time ever that a major Wall Street bank was led by a woman. Currently, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) is one of the notable names, alongside General Motor Company (NYSE: GM), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL), that have women in chief executive roles. However, appointing female CEOs isn\u2019t a symbolic gesture to gain social capital. In fact, a recent study by Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) showcases how impactful female business owners have been in growing their businesses since the pandemic. According to Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC), from 2019 to 2023, women-owned businesses\u2019 growth rate outpaced the rate of men\u2019s 94.3% for number of firms, 252.8% for employment, and 82.0% for revenue. The Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) Impact of Women-Owned Business Report 2024 also revealed that during the pandemic, women-owned businesses added 1.4 million jobs and $579.6 billion in revenue to the US economy. However, like almost every other facet of life, despite their significant contributions to the global economy, women continue to be subjected to inequitable working conditions.\n\nGender Inequality\n\nAccording to the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), 51% of peri and post-menopausal women report menopause negatively impacted their work life. Yet, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) reports that only 14% of these women believe their employers recognize the need for menopause-specific benefits. Moreover, other than a select few nations in the world, most nations, including the US, have no state or federal-level policies to mandate menstrual leaves. Apart from a lack of mindfulness of women-centric challenges, many other biases result in women being financially exploited. A government survey on gender pay gaps in Australia showed that the average gender pay gap of surveyed companies was 19%. This gap was even more significant in firms such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC), where the gap was 48% and 42% respectively. Similarly, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) had a gap of 29%, although the company maintained that this gap was due to a higher proportion of men in senior roles.\n\nAlthough several nations have managed to overcome gender inequality to a significant extent, women in most countries continue to suffer at the hands of social and cultural stigmas. This is particularly evident in the developing world, where many countries have poor gender equality and gender pay gaps are often substantially higher than the global average. A study on gender equality in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2023 revealed that women earn 40 to 46 percent less than men in urban areas. United Nations\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023 revealed that women held only 28% of management positions globally in 2021. Despite it already being poor, the situation in Northern Africa, Western Asia, and Central & South Asia is even worse, with a figure of just 15%. This is despite the fact that gender equality is considered to be one of the most important factors in alleviating poverty. In fact, Moody\u2019s Analytics, a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation (NYSE: MCO) claims that the global economy is losing out on at least $7 trillion of economic gains each year due to a failure to reach gender parity in the workforce.\n\nWith these factors considered, if you\u2019re wondering which country has the worst gender pay gap or where is gender inequality most common in the world, join us as we look at the least feminist countries in the world.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo develop our list of least feminist countries in the world, we utilized 4 different datasets. These included UNDP\u2019s GENDER INEQUALITY INDEX (GII), World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), UN Women\u2019s Women Empowerment Index, and Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security\u2019s (GIWPS) Women Peace and Security Index. Using data from all 4 sources, we calculated an aggregate score for each country. The list was sorted in descending order, with the top 20 items being selected as the least feminist countries in the world.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\n\nOur methodology revealed that Yemen is theleast feminist country in the world.\n\n1. Yemen\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.00\n\nYemen is currently experiencing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 17.6 million people facing food & nutrition insecurity and 4.5 million people currently being displaced. According to UNWFP, in January 2024, 52% of the surveyed households in Yemen were unable to access adequate food. As with other cases of political conflicts, the current situation in Yemen has exacerbated gender disparities.\n\nOver 30 percent of Yemeni girls are married before the age of 18, often because families fail to meet basic needs such as putting food on the table, instead marrying their daughters in the hopes of offering them a better life whilst also alleviating their own financial hardships. For years, authorities have also implemented strict restrictions on travel, requiring women to be accompanied by male guardians when traveling.\n\nConsequently, women experiencing domestic abuse cannot leave their homes without their husband\u2019s permission and can even be disciplined by their partners to ensure they comply. Those managing to escape the vicinity of their homes aren\u2019t better off either. According to a report on gender-based violence in Yemen, during the first 7 months of 2022, Houthi forces abducted over 100 girls on false prostitution charges, subjecting them to virginity tests and assaulting them while in custody.\n\nAlthough Yemen is the least feminist country in the world, our list reveals that in terms of sexual violence and discriminatory legal frameworks, some countries might actually be worse.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out which other countries in the world rank worst in terms of gender equality, check out our free-full list of 20 Least Feminist Countries in the World.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most and least feminist countries in the world to retirement and investment strategies; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.28 billion, showing a 6.09% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.83 per share and a revenue of $57.84 billion, demonstrating changes of +25.09% and +6.82%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Morgan Stanley. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.99% higher within the past month. Morgan Stanley currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nLooking at valuation, Morgan Stanley is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.48. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.22.\n\nWe can also see that MS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.21. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Financial - Investment Bank industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.13 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 11, this industry ranks in the top 5% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "There is no joy like receiving passive income each quarter. I\u00a0am someone who loves\u00a0to receive dividend income and see my money grow without having to do anything. But money will multiply\u00a0only\u00a0if you put it in the right place,\u00a0and\u00a0dividend stocks can be an ideal place to start.\u00a0If\u00a0you seek steady dividend income and long-term growth, consider the overlooked dividend stocks mentioned here.\u00a0They have a history of raising dividends and are known for bringing stability to your portfolio.\n\nThese are solid businesses that have gained investor trust and become industry experts. Whether you are only starting or rebalancing your portfolio, here are three dividend stocks to consider, each trading below $100 with a dividend yield over 3%. Now, without further delay, let\u2019s dive deep into them!\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend yield: 3.13%\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)\u00a0is often overlooked\u00a0because it keeps moving sideways and hasn\u2019t shown much upside over the past two years.\u00a0Trading at $62, the stock is up only 3% year-to-date and has been moving between $52 and $62 for the past 12 months. However, looking at the company\u2019s rich history, legacy business, and global presence, Coca-Cola is one of the best investments you can make.\n\nIt is\u00a0Warren Buffett\u2019s\u00a0favorite stock for a reason. I think investors need to look beyond the financials\u00a0when it comes to\u00a0this company. It has seen several market ups and downs and survived them all.\n\nWhen you\u00a0put\u00a0money into this company, you\u00a0are investing\u00a0in the brand.\u00a0Coca-Cola has licensed the formula to beverage makers across the world\u00a0and\u00a0this has helped increase production significantly. It also ensures steady and consistent availability of the products across the globe.\n\nIn the\u00a0first-quarter results, the company reported revenue of $11.3 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.72. Organic sales increased 11% in the quarter\u00a0and\u00a0the management is aiming for an organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, up from the previous range of 6% to 7%.\n\nThe company enjoys stable cash flow and has\u00a0been paying\u00a0dividends for 63 years. It recently increased the dividend by 5.4% to $0.485 per share per quarter. With a yield of 3.13%, Coca-Cola is one of the best dividend stocks to own.\u00a0You may not be able to find a stock that offers the same stability and reliability\u00a0to your portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend yield: 3.44%\n\nAnother overlooked dividend stock is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).\u00a0Trading at $98, the stock is up 5% YTD and 18% in the past 12 months. Earlier, the company generated\u00a0the majority\u00a0of its revenue from traditional banking and trading but has moved towards asset management and investment banking.\n\nThe transition has paid off\u00a0and\u00a0the company has seen steady growth.\u00a0This\u00a0has also made it stable and reliable. Today, it derives a higher revenue from wealth management.\n\nIn the\u00a0first quarter, the net income stood at $3.4 billion for a revenue of $15.1 billion. The investment banking revenue increased 16% YoY\u00a0while\u00a0the wealth management segment was up 5%.\n\nGrowth in investment banking helped the profit jump 14% YOY.\u00a0 It also completed two acquisitions\u00a0back\u00a0in 2020, E-Trade and Eaton Vance which\u00a0has helped with revenue growth. It reported an EPS of $2.02\u00a0which\u00a0is up 19% YOY.\n\nMorgan Stanley has a dividend yield of 3.44%\u00a0and\u00a0the dividend\u00a0has grown 27% in the past\u00a05\u00a0years. It has increased dividends for 11 consecutive years. With an improved market and better economic conditions, Morgan Stanley could be\u00a0in a better position\u00a0to deliver higher dividends. The company has had\u00a0a good\u00a0start to the year and is on a roll.\n\nWith investment banking back in full force, it makes sense to invest in Morgan Stanley before it hits the triple digits.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend yield: 5.82%\n\nBeaten-down Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a value stock, and investors who manage to bag it at the current level could\u00a0be setting\u00a0themselves up for massive gains in the\u00a0long-term.\u00a0Exchanging hands for $28, the stock has dropped 21% in the past 12 months and has lost most of its value since the pandemic. Its claim to fame was the COVIDvaccine\u00a0but\u00a0investors need to realize that there is so much more to Pfizer.\n\nWhile the past few years haven\u2019t been easy for the\u00a0company\u00a0it has successfully invested the cash it earned during the pandemic into drugs that can become blockbusters in the next few years.\n\nIt acquired Seagen for $43 billion, a cancer drug developer\u00a0which already has\u00a0four approved medicines.\u00a0This\u00a0is its\u00a0biggest\u00a0investment in the recent years. It received nine FDA approvals in 2023 and\u00a0was recently granted full approval for the cervical cancer drug.\n\nPfizer reported a 19% drop in revenue in the\u00a0first quarter which\u00a0has led\u00a0to the stock sell-off, but the management has reaffirmed the full-year revenue guidance of $58.5 to $61.5 billion. PFE is one of the most overlooked dividend stocks in 2024.\n\nI think\u00a0Pfizer\u2019s worst days are over, and we could start seeing growth through its blockbuster drugs. The company is working on reducing operational costs\u00a0and\u00a0this\u00a0could help improve the bottom line.\u00a0It enjoys a dividend yield of 5.82% and has raised the dividends annually since 2009.\u00a0I think it\u00a0has enough liquidity to keep rewarding investors and raise dividends further.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 4.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.66 per share, indicating a change of +33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.83 points to a change of +25.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.72 indicates a change of +13% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.1%. The $57.84 billion and $60.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.8% and +4.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $15.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.3%. EPS of $2.02 for the same period compares with $1.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.6%. The EPS surprise was +19.53%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Morgan Stanley Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Morgan Stanley (MS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMorgan Stanley's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Morgan Stanley's main business drivers.\n\nFounded in 1935 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1981, Morgan Stanley is the leading financial services holding company headquartered in New York. With 79,610 employees, the company serves a diversified group of clients and customers \u2014 including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals \u2014 through offices across 41 countries.\n\nThe company\u2019s business is divided into three segments:\n\nThe Institutional Securities (\"IS\") segment (contributing 42.6% of total net revenues in 2023) includes capital raising; financial advisory services that include advices on mergers and acquisitions (M&As), restructurings, real estate and project finance; corporate lending; sales, trading, financing and market-making activities in equity and fixed income securities and related products, including foreign exchange and commodities; benchmark indices and risk management analytics; and investment activities.\r\n\r\nThe Wealth Management (\"WM\") segment (48.5%) provides brokerage and investment advisory services covering various investment alternatives; financial and wealth planning services; annuity and other insurance products; credit and other lending products; cash management services; retirement services; and trust and fiduciary services and engages in fixed income principal trading.\r\n\r\nThe Investment Management (\"IM\") segment (8.9%) provides global asset management products and services in equity, fixed income, alternative investments that include hedge funds and funds of funds, and merchant banking including real estate, private equity and infrastructure, to institutional and retail clients through proprietary and third-party distribution channels. The segment also engages in investment.\n\nIn 2019, Morgan Stanley acquired Canada-based Solium Capital Inc. and renamed it as Shareworks by Morgan Stanley. In 2020, the company acquired E*Trade Financial. In 2021, it acquired Eaton Vance.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Morgan Stanley, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $3,245.98, or a gain of 224.60%, as of May 27, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 179.12% and gold's return of 77.20% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for MS too.\n\nMorgan Stanley's new strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ will bolster its presence in Japan and support footprint diversification efforts. Also, initiatives to become less dependent on capital-markets-driven revenue sources, inorganic expansion efforts and high rates will likely aid the top line. Per our estimates, total revenues are expected to witness a CAGR of 4.1% by 2026. Yet, rising costs is likely to hamper profitability. We project total non-interest expenses to record a CAGR of 2.3% by 2026. Its shares have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The ambiguity of the performance of the capital markets is a major woe and will likely hurt the Institutional Securities segment\u2019s prospects. However, resurgence of investment banking (IB) business and the company\u2019s solid pipeline in the business will aid financials.\n\nShares have gained 6.61% over the past four weeks and there have been 8 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nBeverage and snack food giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\u00a0hasn\u2019t had\u00a0a good\u00a0start to the year. PEP stock is up 3% year-to-date and hasn\u2019t rallied much.\u00a0Trading at $179, the stock is a buy in the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts business is doing well\u00a0and\u00a0even if the company sees a drop in sales volume in one quarter, it wouldn\u2019t affect the long-term business outlook. If you have been waiting for the stock to dip before you\u00a0make your\u00a0move, now is the time.\n\nPepsiCo is so much more than a beverage company and generates more than half of the income from the food segment, this\u00a0diversification is\u00a0the reason\u00a0you should bet your money on the company. It allows the company to enjoy steady growth. In the first quarter, PepsiCo saw a 2.7% rise in organic sales and\u00a0is projecting\u00a0a 4% rise in sales throughout 2024.\n\nIf you are a passive income investor, a dividend yield of 3.02% and a steady rise in dividends should be reason enough to hold on to the stock. With summer approaching, PepsiCo could have better days ahead.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend aristocrat Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a safe stock in\u00a0times of\u00a0market uncertainty. Both of its segments, innovative medicine, and\u00a0MedTech\u00a0are thriving.\n\nThe innovative medicine sector reported a 2.5% jump in sales to hit $13.6 billion\u00a0while\u00a0the MedTech division grew 6.3% to\u00a0hit\u00a0$7.8. billion.

It\u00a0enjoys\u00a0a dividend yield of 3.31% and announced a 4.2%\u00a0rise in dividend\u00a0in the first-quarter results.\u00a0JNJ is one of the top dividend stocks to buy.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u00a0enjoys\u00a0steady cash flow growth and ended the quarter with $26 billion\u00a0in cash.

One is\u00a0the growing transition from cash to cards. The demand for cards is going to be on the rise as people across the world continue to use their debit and credit cards.\n\nSecond, the company has successfully managed to capture the\u00a0attention of the younger generation.\u00a0About 60% of its new customer accounts came from Gen Z and millennials.\u00a0This\u00a0specific\u00a0demographic is jumping on the earning ladder and could be using debit and credit cards for all\u00a0of\u00a0their purchases, making American Express indispensable.\n\nAmerican Express reported an 11% YOY rise in revenue for the first quarter to hit $15.8 billion and a 34% YOY jump in the net income to reach $2.4 billion. It added 3.4 million cards in the quarter.\n\nTrading at $235 today, the stock is up 25% YTD and has increased 56% in the past 12 months. The company has a steady source of income\u00a0and\u00a0as the usage of cards increases, American Express will make more money. It increased the dividend by 17% this year and\u00a0enjoys\u00a0a yield of 1.19%.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) two construction workers on a worksite\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere are several reasons to bet on Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock. The largest construction equipment manufacturer in the world has reported impressive first-quarter results. The company enjoys a diversified business that caters to multiple industries\u00a0and\u00a0its revenue came in at $15.8 billion\u00a0and\u00a0the net income soared 47% YOY to hit $2.86 billion.\n\nThe management expects the 2024 sales to be similar to 2023\u00a0but\u00a0I do not think it will impact the dividends.\u00a0Trading at $350 today, CAT stock is up 19% YTD and 67% in the past 12 months.\n\nIt has an envious balance sheet and a steady cash flow\u00a0which\u00a0allows\u00a0the company to offer a dividend yield of 1.48%.\u00a0It is currently focusing on growing its service revenue so\u00a0that the\u00a0company does not suffer during extreme market conditions.\n\nCaterpillar holds a global presence and operates in an industry that can never run out of demand. It is a mature company set to benefit from the growing importance given to the construction industry.\u00a0The company has raised dividends for three consecutive decades, making it one of\u00a0the top dividend stocks to own.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: Walmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving impressed with the first-quarter numbers, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock went from $59 to $64 in a day.\u00a0Trading at $64 today, the stock is up 22% YTD and has been quietly moving in the upward direction.\u00a0As inflation cools, Walmart will be the first\u00a0one\u00a0to benefit because we\u00a0are never going to\u00a0stop spending on groceries and household essentials.\n\nIt reported a revenue of $161 billion\u00a0with\u00a0the EPS coming in at $0.60. The company isn\u2019t the one to sit back and watch consumer preferences change, instead, it pounces on every opportunity to grow. It has invested in the e-commerce segment and saw a 22% jump in e-commerce sales in the recent quarter.\n\nDespite the economic challenges, Walmart is ready to take off. Having paid dividends for over 50 years, the company recently announced a 9% dividend hike. With a dividend yield of 1.28%, WMT stock is a long-term buy and hold\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0looks inexpensive to me at the current level. It certainly has the potential to raise dividends in the coming quarters and is one of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother fintech company I love, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)\u00a0has bounced back with an improvement in the investment banking sector.

It also saw a 100% YOY jump in the debt underwriting revenue. A rate cut and an improved economic outlook could benefit the company.\n\nExchanging hands for $98, the stock is just up 5% YTD\u00a0and\u00a0I believe it has a long runway. It has a dividend yield of 3.44% and pays an annual dividend of $3.40.\u00a0Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite stock, Morgan\u00a0Stanley\u00a0is here to stay\u00a0and\u00a0the investment banking sector will keep driving growth.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nFast food giant Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)\u00a0\u00a0is making slow and steady moves.\u00a0Trading at $502 as of writing, DPZ stock is up 21% YTD and 63% in the last 12 months. The company\u2019s dividend is as tasty as the pizza. With a dividend yield of 1.20%, Domino\u2019s has raised the payout for the past 12 years\u00a0and\u00a0I am\u00a0certain\u00a0it will continue doing the same.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue increased 7.3%\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0reported an EPS of $3.58, better than expectations. Its net income jumped 20% to $126 million, and the same-store sales grew 5.6% in the\u00a0U.S.\n\nDomino\u2019s expansion strategy is paying off, and it has successfully managed to open multiple stores across the globe. It aims to open 1,100 stores by 2028. The company\u2019s effective marketing and pricing\u00a0has\u00a0helped it reach new highs, and I am\u00a0certain\u00a0your investment will pay off in the coming years. Domino\u2019s is a global leader, a household name, and has a long way to go.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nBased in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 6.08%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.85 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.44%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.45%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.58%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.33%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 59%. This means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nEarnings growth looks solid for MS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.83 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 25.09%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that MS is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Is Evercore (EVR) Up 9% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Evercore (EVR). Shares have added about 9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Evercore due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nEvercore Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/Y\n\nEvercore\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20. The bottom line compared unfavorably with earnings of $2.16 per share reported a year ago.\r\n\r\nResults were affected due to a rise in expenses. Nonetheless, an increase in revenues generated from the Investment Management and Investment Banking & Equities segments offered support. Further, an improvement in AUM balance was another positive.\r\n\r\nNet income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $85.7 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues & Expenses Rise\n\nIn first-quarter 2024, total revenues of $585 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $652.7 million. Nonetheless, the top line increased 1.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nOn an adjusted basis, net revenues came in at $587.3 million, up 1.7% year over year.\r\n\r\nTotal expenses increased 6.8% to $496.7 million. This was mainly due to a rise in almost all the components of total expenses, except depreciation and amortization costs, special charges, including business realignment costs and other operating expenses.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted compensation ratio was 66%, up from the prior-year quarter\u2019s 63.5%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating margin was 15.4%, down from the prior-year quarter\u2019s 20%.\n\nQuarterly Segmental Performance (GAAP Basis)\n\nInvestment Banking & Equities: Net revenues increased 1.2% year over year to $561.7 million. However, operating income decreased 23.3% to $78.9 million.\r\n\r\nInvestment Management: Net revenues were $19.1 million, up 10.1% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. Operating income was $5.2 million, up 27.7% from the year-ago quarter. AUM was $13 billion as of Mar 31, 2024, up 18% year over year.\n\nBalance Sheet Position\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $569.8 million and investment securities and certificates of deposit were $865.3 million. Moreover, current assets exceeded current liabilities by $1.5 billion as of the same date.\n\nShare Repurchase Activities\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Evercore repurchased 1.5 million shares at an average price of $177.04.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -21.43% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Evercore has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F.

        "title": "The Analyst Anxiety Index: 3 Stocks to Avoid as Uncertainty Grows",
        "content": "Global stocks are surging. The MSCI ACWI Index, which encompasses both developed and emerging markets, reached another all-time high, continuing its record-breaking streak. This milestone is part of a broader trend in global equity markets, with 14 out of the world\u2019s 20 largest stock exchanges recently setting new records. In contrast to this general market uplift, stocks with analyst uncertainty remain a notable exception, where divergent views among experts signal potential volatility and risk for investors.\n\nIn the United States, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes have also hit record levels, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing the 40,000 mark for the first time in history. This bullish momentum is mirrored across major markets in Europe, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia, where stock indices are either at or near their highest points.\n\nFactors such as anticipated interest rate cuts, robust economies and strong corporate earnings propel the markets forward. Moreover, the presence of approximately $6 trillion in money market funds provides potential fuel for the rally to continue, with few apparent risks on the horizon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe April downturn in global stocks was short-lived, as buyers quickly re-entered the market, contributing to the S&P 500\u2019s longest stretch without a 2% decline since 2017-2018, lasting 311 days. Even Chinese equities, which have faced challenges since peaking in February 2021, show signs of recovery.\n\nInvestors hope the economy will remain robust while inflation decreases, leading to speculation that the Federal Reserve may relax monetary policy later in the year. As valuations increase, many analysts adjust their ratings to consider the latest stock prices. Along these lines, here are three stocks with analyst uncertainty to avoid, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nBolt Biotherapeutics (BOLT) An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around it\n\nSource: ra2 studio/Shutterstock\n\nBolt Biotherapeutics (NASDAQ:BOLT) shares experienced a series of downgrades from various analysts following the discontinuation of its lead program, BDC-1001 and significant changes in strategy and management.\n\nLeerink Partners shifted their rating from Outperform to Market Perform and adjusted the price target to $1.00 from the previous $3.00. The halt influenced the decision to develop BDC-1001, the company\u2019s lead immune-stimulating antibody conjugate (ISAC) and the subsequent corporate restructuring, which includes a 50% reduction in the workforce.\n\nGuggenheim also downgraded Bolt Biotherapeutics from Buy to Neutral, removing their price target entirely. The analyst cited low visibility on the success probabilities of the company\u2019s remaining product candidates, BDC-3042 and BDC-4182, as a reason for the downgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\nStifel followed suit, lowering their rating from Buy to Hold and decreasing the price target to $1.50 from $6.00. Stifel\u2019s analyst highlighted the challenges facing Bolt, including skepticism about the monotherapy efficacy prospects of BDC-3042 and the competitive landscape for BDC-4182, an ISAC targeting claudin-18.2, which is expected to enter clinical trials in FY25.\n\nConcerns were also raised about the potential safety profile of the next-generation platform, given the issues with toxicity in previous programs.\n\nUnder Armour (UAA) the exterior of an Under Armour store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnder Armour (NYSE:UAA) stock was downgraded at two sell-side brokers last week. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) shifted from a \u2018Neutral\u2019 to an \u2018Underweight\u2019 rating, with a revised price target set to $6.00, a decrease from the previous $8.00 target. In a separate move, William Blair downgraded Under Armor from \u2018Outperform\u2019 to \u2018Market Perform.\u2019\n\nThe downgrade move reflects the company\u2019s forecast for fiscal year 2025, which includes an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) significantly lower than current market expectations, alongside anticipated revenue declines and margin pressures.\n\nThe analyst moves come after Under Armour management offered a weaker-than-expected outlook. On the top line, UAA sees revenue decline in the negative low-double-digits, which is less optimistic than the Street\u2019s forecast of a 2.4% year-over-year increase.\n\nFor the near-term outlook, Under Armour guided a diluted loss per share of -$0.08 to -$0.10 for the first quarter of 2025, in contrast to the Street\u2019s anticipated $0.04 EPS. This guidance is based on expected revenues to be down in the low-teens year-over-year, which is below the Street\u2019s estimate of a 0.1% decline and a predicted gross margin decrease of 20-30 basis points year-over-year, contrary to the Street\u2019s expectation of a 70 basis points increase.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) lowered its stance on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), downgrading the stock from Overweight to Equal-weight and lowering the price target to $125 from the previous $140. Baidu, known for its dominant internet search engine in China, has expanded its business into cloud services and artificial intelligence. The shift in analyst ratings contributes to the volatility and places Baidu among the stocks with analyst uncertainty.\n\nThe broker highlighted a modest year-over-year increase in Baidu\u2019s core revenue for the second quarter but also pointed to a weak advertising outlook. Even though the company\u2019s cloud growth is expected to pick up pace, the analyst noted that the monetization of Baidu\u2019s artificial intelligence technology is still in the early stages.\n\nDespite a 17% rally in Baidu\u2019s stock price, Morgan Stanley sees limited near-term catalysts for further growth. Analysts also noted that while iQIYI, a subsidiary of Baidu, is experiencing cyclical weakness, it is expected to achieve sustainable long-term growth.\n\nMacquarie analyst Ellie Jiang also downgraded Baidu\u2019s stock from Outperform to Neutral in a separate move. This additional downgrade by another brokerage firm reflects a broader consensus among analysts regarding Baidu\u2019s current market position and future prospects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Annual Study Shows Wide Majority of Employees Want Workplace Support for Financial Challenges",
        "content": "Data from Morgan Stanley at Work indicates workplace benefits remain key driver of engagement and retention for employees While HR leaders are improving their offerings, opportunities remain to close gaps in addressing employee needs\n\nNEW YORK, May 23, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley at Work today issued new data from its fourth annual State of the Workplace Financial Benefits Study. Findings underscore the strategic importance of workplace financial benefits in driving financial outcomes for both companies and employees amid a shifting economic backdrop:\n\nEmployees want employers to help with their financial challenges: Most (91%) HR leaders suspect employees are facing financial hardships, up from 86% in 2021. And nearly half of employees (46%) agree they have experienced financial crises or issues with financial management in the past year, with roughly 4 out of 5 (81%) saying they want their employers to be more involved in helping them through specific financial challenges. Financial benefits continue to drive retention and engagement: Roughly 9 in 10 HR leaders (87%) believe comprehensive financial benefits are a key factor for employees in deciding to stay or leave for another job\u2014an 8% increase since 2021. Employees concur, with 71% very or extremely interested in accepting a new job if the company provides the financial benefits they need. Benefits awareness is needed: Despite the desire for greater financial support at work, a third (32%) of employees say they have never thought to reach out to their companies for help, and 85% believe their company needs to do a better job explaining how to maximize the financial benefits offered. Most (96%) of HR leaders agree. HR leaders believe more work needs to be done: While a majority of HR executives (54%) feel their company is making some progress in offering financial benefits to employees\u2014a 10-point increase since last year\u2014they also feel it\u2019s not enough to meet demand. In fact, about 4 out of 5 (82%) say employees have asked for specific financial benefits their company does not offer, indicating the importance of more comprehensive solutions. AI stands poised to affect workplace financial benefits: More than 8 in 10 (82%) employees who work at companies offering financial benefits expect AI to transform their benefits experience, and nearly all HR executives (98%) agree.\n\n\"Since we first fielded this study in 2021, each year has seen employees and employers face dramatic shifts in economic climate. Yet a clear constant throughout our research has been the theme that financial benefits are a strategic priority,\" said Scott Whatley, Head of Morgan Stanley at Work. \"To better support employees, employers need comprehensive solutions that are both scalable and can also cater to the high touch, complex needs of executives\u2014and HR leaders agree more can be done, including exploring emerging technologies. With so much in motion, the choices companies make in terms of the quality and scope of their offering will continue to have an outsize business impact.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"On the heels of building a dynamic, world-class wealth management ecosystem, we are able serve corporates and their participants at all stages of their respective financial journeys\u2014from startups to multinationals, and from first-year employees to executives,\" said Brian McDonald, Head of Direct and Institutional Businesses. \"These findings underline that the need for comprehensive workplace solutions\u2014delivered at scale\u2014remains a top priority.\"\n\nAdditional details are available in Morgan Stanley at Work\u2019s State of the Workplace Study here. As part of a series of findings from Morgan Stanley at Work\u2019s fourth annual study, the business will also publish its findings on equity benefits and retirement benefits in the coming weeks.\n\nMethodology: The data from the Morgan Stanley at Work Employees Survey and HR Leaders Survey comes from a survey of 1,000 U.S.-employed adults and 600 HR leaders for companies. The survey was conducted on behalf of Morgan Stanley at Work using an email invitation and an online survey between February 5 and February 12, 2024, by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com).\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley at Work Morgan Stanley at Work provides workplace financial benefits that build financial confidence and foster loyalty\u2014helping companies attract and retain top talent.

        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which tech stocks to buy this month, look no further. Technology stocks continue to offer investors big growth opportunities. While the market rally is broadening out, tech stocks are still leading with outsized gains. And it is not just the mega-cap technology companies known as the Magnificent 7 where opportunities are to be found. A range of different technology stocks are providing shareholders with market beating returns.\n\nCatalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI), a rebound in online advertising, the popularity of streaming, demand for microchips and semiconductors, and the resurgence of cryptocurrencies are propelling stocks of technology companies to new heights. While there are other sectors to invest in, none have provided as much consistent growth as tech stocks since we emerged from the 2008-09 financial crisis 15 years ago.\n\nHere are seven tech stocks that could be millionaire-makers: May edition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Dell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) have doubled in the last six months and continue to run hot. DELL stock recently closed at an all-time high on expectations that the company will see exponential growth from sales of both AI laptop computers and servers. The company run by founder Michael Dell has emerged as a leader in the AI sector. In the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has risen 211%.\n\nThe most recent boost to Dell stock came after investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) raised its price target on the shares and forecast that the company would get a sizable revenue boost from sales of servers that run AI applications. Morgan Stanley expects about $10 billion of AI server revenue from Dell in the company\u2019s current fiscal year that ends in February 2025.\n\nThe bank lifted its price target on DELL stock to $152 a share from $128 previously and named the company a \u201ctop pick\u201d in the technology sector.\n\nReddit (RDDT) In this photo illustration the Reddit logo seen displayed on a smartphone and on the background.

Most recently, RDDT stock increased 11% on news that it has struck a partnership with leading AI start-up OpenAI. The OpenAI partnership is expected to attract more users to Reddit\u2019s social media platform with AI-enhancements and increased advertising. OpenAI has committed to becoming an advertising partner of Reddit, which runs online message boards, including the popular WallStreetBets site.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Reddit, which held its initial public offering (IPO) at the end of March this year, got a boost after the company issued its first earnings report as a public company. RDDT stock jumped 15% higher after the concern reported a better-than-expected loss per share of $8.19, which was not as bad as a loss of $8.71 that was expected among analysts. Sales in the quarter totaled $243 million, which was much better than consensus forecasts of $212.8 million. Reddit said its sales rose 48% from a year earlier.\n\nRDDT stock is now up 30% since its market debut two months ago.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

GOOGL stock has caught fire on growing evidence that the company is reasserting its dominance in the field of AI. Alphabet just held its annual I/O developer conference where it unveiled a host of new AI innovations, winning praise from analysts and investors.\n\nAlso in recent weeks, Alphabet declared its first ever dividend payment alongside blowout first-quarter earnings. The technology giant will pay a cash dividend of 20 cents per share starting on June 17. The company also announced a new $70 billion stock buyback program. The company had $108 billion of cash at the end of Q1. The dividend and share repurchases were announced alongside Q1 results that crushed forecasts, boosted by a resurgence in online advertising.\n\nGOOGL stock is now up 42% over the past 12 months.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s currently a buy-the-dip opportunity with the stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The shares have pulled back in recent weeks and are currently trading 25% below their 52-week high. The drawdown comes following explosive growth in SMCI stock. In the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has risen 457%. And that\u2019s after the current pullback is factored in. So far in 2024, SMCI stock has more than tripled.\n\nThe growth in Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock was big enough to get it added to the benchmark S&P 500 index. The current dip in SMCI stock comes after the company reported year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of 200% for Q1 of this year. Super Micro Computer also raised its forward guidance. But none of that seemed to be enough to impress investors.\n\nThe maker of high-efficiency servers that run AI applications, and Dell competitor, has seen its share price increase more than 4,500% in the last five years.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Coinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform.

COIN stock is now up 274% over the last 12 months, having surged after the company\u2019s Q1 earnings print. Coinbase reported EPS of $4.40, which was 303% higher than the $1.09 expected among analysts.\n\nRevenue in the January through March quarter totaled $1.64 billion versus $1.34 billion that was expected on Wall Street. Coinbase Global, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., said the results were due to a big rise in crypto trading during Q1 as the price of Bitcoin reached a record high of just under $74,000 in March. Consumer transaction revenue on the exchange during this year\u2019s first quarter was up more than 100% from a year ago.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) have more than doubled over the last 12 months as the audio streaming company controls costs and posts strong financial results. So far in 2024, SPOT stock has gained 62%. The share price really took off after the company announced Q1 earnings that beat expectations across the board despite user growth at the music and podcast streaming platform missing lofty Wall Street forecasts.\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek has called 2024 a \u201cyear of monetization.\u201d In recent months, Spotify has raised prices on individual streaming plans in the U.S. for the first time since 2011 and cut 17% of its global workforce, equal to about 1,500 employees. The cost controls and price increases have had a positive impact on Spotify\u2019s financial results. The company now has 615 million monthly active users on its streaming platform, and growing.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish chipmaker Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has only been publicly traded since last fall, but its stock is benefitting from multiple catalysts.

        "content": "Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.\n\nThis marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.\n\nChip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks. Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom\u2019s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.\n\nMost recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBroadcom\u2019s inclusion in Barclays\u2019 list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry\u2019s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company\u2019s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.\n\nBarclays\u2019 attention to AI\u2019s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company\u2019s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters.

Micron\u2019s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix\u2019s (OTC:HXSCL). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.\n\nThe brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It\u2019s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States\u2019 largest memory chip manufacturer.\n\nThe upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from \u201cUnderweight\u201d to \u201cEqualweight\u201d and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 \u2014 an increase of over 32%.\n\nBaird\u2019s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.\n\nThis slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron\u2019s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron\u2019s production of HBM3E, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website.

Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company\u2019s AI dynamics are \u201ca sweet spot for the company\u2019s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.\u201c\n\nSimilarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro\u2019s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company\u2019s building block architecture.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "NIO Stock Price Targets: $10 From Morgan Stanley or $5.40 From JPMorgan?",
        "content": "Wall Street can\u2019t seem to get its act straight when it comes to Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock. As my colleague Eddie Pan recently noted, during the first quarter Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) was the biggest buyer of the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s stock.\n\nThe investment house scooped up 10.1 million shares of NIO, increasing its stake in the company by more than half to 28.2 million shares. It has a buy rating on Nio stock and a $10 per share one-year price target, a nearly 100% implied gain from the EV maker\u2019s current price.\n\nAt the same time, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analysts had a sell rating on the stock that it just upgraded to neutral.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt has a $5.40 price target, or a 3% implied gain. Overall, Wall Street has a hold rating on the stock but an $8.48 per share consensus price target, implying 62% upside in Nio stock.\n\nSo which is it? Should investors be buying this EV stock just like Morgan Stanley or should they stay away?\n\nThe Bull Argument\n\nOn the one hand, an argument can be made to rush in. Nio stock has been beaten down pretty hard over the past year. Shares are down 42% in 2024 and 68% from its 52-week high.\n\nIt did rally higher earlier this month after reporting a surprise update to its delivery report. After telling investors to expect deliveries to come in lower than previously expected, Nio enjoyed a massive 134% gain increase from the year-ago period. It delivered 15,620 vehicles.\n\nLast week it followed up by introducing its new low-price EV, the Onvo L60 SUV. The car that will retail for 219,900 yuan, or just under $30,500.\n\nThat makes it competitive to one of Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) bestselling EVs, the Model Y SUV, which sells for 263,900 renminbi (RMB), or $36,500.\n\nRenminbi is China\u2019s official currency while the yuan representing the country\u2019s primary unit of the currency. They are often used interchangeably.\n\nThe EV price war isn\u2019t just a phenomenon occurring in the U.S. It is a global phenomenon as demand for EVs wanes. EV manufacturers everywhere, including in China, are slashing prices to boost sales. Nio hopes this will spur Chinese consumers to buy more of its vehicles.\n\nAdditional Bullish Sentiment\n\nBut it\u2019s not just China EV manufacturers trying to grow sales. Beijing is stepping in too. The Wall Street Journalrecently reported, China is \u201cencouraging unprofitable carmakers to keep producing as officials try to boost economic growth, preserve jobs and expand China\u2019s role in the global electric-vehicle business.\u201d\n\nIt has subsidized new energy vehicle manufacturers to the tune of $173 billion between 2009 and 2023. In one case, a government injected $27.5 million into a company that sold fewer than 2,000 cars in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s argument for its bullish outlook for the stock is the government\u2019s stimulus policies will provide a tailwind for the EV maker just as it introduces a cheaper-than-expected car.\n\nIt advises investors to keep an eye on how big the consumer response is to the Onvo L60.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan\u2019s upgrade from sell to neutral is based on stimulus tail winds too.\n\nThe Bear Argument\n\nWhile the Onvo L60 is cheaper than the Tesla, it\u2019s not the cheapest car on the market. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Louis Navellier notes, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) makes an even cheaper model.\n\nIt sells the Seagull that retails for less than $9,700. Navellier writes, \u201cif Nio is trying to compete in price war, the company definitely has some catching up to do.\u201d\n\nAnd Nio is burning through cash at a torrid pace. It has $2.2 billion in net cash available but burned through $2.3 billion last year, according to The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0And that\u2019s the problem with Nio.

The cheaper model from the luxury EV maker might not be the big hit it hoped for, particularly since there are much less expensive models available.

        "content": "Even though inflation has been high for a long time, the allure of high-potential tech stocks persists.\n\nIn May, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve Board didn\u2019t bring rates down from a record high of 5.25% to 5.5%. However, the markets are eagerly anticipating the June meeting.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) says stocks are too expensive and buyers may have too high of hopes for business results. Because of this, 2024 is expected to be a more even year with growth rates lower than 10 percent. J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) expects the real GDP to grow by 0.7% in 2024 because when the pandemic ended, monetary policy became stricter and economic tailwinds stopped.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this case, we\u2019ll look at three tech companies with big prospects that have buy rates and double-digit upsides. The first is a strong rival in the artificial intelligence (AI) market thanks to its cutting-edge AI chipsets, which have helped it grow 20% this year. Another company is changing its financial plan to buy back a lot of its own shares and pay bonuses. Finally, a third company offers simple mobile apps and smart AI to take advantage of the growing game industry and better internet access in developing countries. Let\u2019s delve in.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is up 20% this year due to its AI chipsets. But analysts still rate it a strong buy, with a 15% upside potential.\n\nAs businesses search for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) substitutes, AMD is poised to seize a sizable portion of the market with the launch of its MI300X GPU chipset. Nvidia controls the market for AI chips, with an 80% market share. Yet, AMD is emerging as a worthy contender.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD dominates high-performance computing. It powers 156 new Top500 supercomputers, up 29% from last year. Many high-end supercomputers employ AMD Instinct MI300A APUs.\n\nMoreover, AMD\u2019s Alveo V80 is coming down the pike. Those include next-generation firewalls and network security, genome sequencing, molecular dynamics, and other computationally demanding applications.\u200b\n\nAMD\u2019s first-quarter revenue was $5.47 billion, up 2.2%. And its profitability was $123 million after losing $139 million in Q1 2023. The company\u2019s $0.62 EPS exceeded $0.61. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.13 billion, 21% more than GAAP $36 million.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices expects Q2 sales of $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, up 6% year-over-year (YOY) and 4% sequentially.\n\nIn recognition of its innovation, AMD received the IEEE 2024 Corporate Innovation Award for its chipset design leadership in high-performance and flexible computing, placing it well among high-potential tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) The logo for T-Mobile is displayed on a sign for an indoor retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s (NASDAQ:TMUS) 1.59% dividend yield is below the industry average. Yet, it\u2019s part of a substantial share repurchase and financial flexibility strategy.\u200b\n\nThe company repurchased 21.9 million shares for $3.6 billion in Q1 of 2024. As of March 31, the business repurchased 136.2 million shares for $19.8 billion. Also, it can use an additional $11.7 billion for buybacks. Meanwhile, the annual dividend is $2.60 per share, yielding about 1.59%.\n\nT-Mobile predicts postpaid net customer additions of 5.2 million to 5.6 million in 2024, up from 5.0 million to 5.5 million. And $31.4\u2013$31.9 billion Core Adjusted EBITDA is expected.\n\nAdditionally, TMUS has officially finalized the $1.35 billion deal to buy Ka\u2019ena Corporation, which owns Mint and Ultra Mobile. The purchase would use T-Mobile\u2019s size to improve these companies\u2019 products and services while maintaining their business structures.\n\nRyan Reynolds will continue as a creative executive while Mint Mobile\u2019s owners handle T-Mobile brands. This deal is projected to enhance T-Mobile\u2019s Core Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow later this year.\u200b\n\nOn the product end, T-Mobile is enhancing its mid-band 5G network. The expansion moves 95% of T-Mobile\u2019s 5G traffic to mid-band, assuring reliability and speed.\n\nOpera (OPRA) An image of hands controlling a game on a cellphone, a charger and mug in the background\n\nSource: Ayunannas/Shutterstock\n\nOpera (NASDAQ:OPRA) is one of the best high-potential tech stocks because it operates one of the preferred browsers for the gaming community, Opera GX. Although it is difficult to get a firm estimate of the gaming segment, one projection indicates that in 2024, there will be 3.32 billion active video gamers worldwide. Opera is leveraging this growth.\n\nIn addition, Opera\u2019s lightweight mobile browsers are popular in South Asia, Africa and Latin America with underpowered devices. The company should develop significantly as internet coverage rises in these locations. Unsurprisingly, thanks to significant growth potential, analysts rate the stock a strong buy, with a 64% upside.\n\nMost importantly, Opera\u2019s future growth rests on new product developments. To that end, Opera One, a redesigned desktop browser, received the IF DESIGN AWARD 2024. This was due to its new architecture, AI and design. AI Feature Drops, a bi-weekly feature in Opera One, lets users test new AI capabilities.\u200b\n\nAlso, Opera signed an agreement with Google, extending its search agreement with Google. This ensures the continued integration of Google\u2019s search capabilities within its products\u200b.\n\nIn addition, OPRA revealed experimental support for 150 local Large Language Model (LLM) versions in its browser. So, this makes it the first major browser with local AI model access, and a quality pick among high-potential tech stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Majority of surveyed companies globally (85%) see sustainability as a value creation opportunity High investment needs cited as top barrier to sustainability efforts, making access to capital a key enabler Nearly 25% believe climate change is impacting their business today, on par with risks like technological change and geopolitical conflict\n\nNEW YORK, May 21, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Corporates worldwide see sustainability primarily as a value creation opportunity according to a new \"Sustainable Signals\" report by the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing. The survey polled over 300 private and public companies across North America, Europe and APAC to understand how sustainability factors into their businesses and where their organizations see the greatest opportunities and challenges.\n\n\"Sustainability strategies and core business strategies are converging, with companies increasingly seeing sustainability factors as integral to the company\u2019s long-term value creation,\" says Jessica Alsford, Chief Sustainability Officer at Morgan Stanley and CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Investing. \"There may yet be challenges in developing expertise and financing models, but corporate leaders view sustainable business practices as fueling the creation of value as well as the mitigation of risk.\"\n\nA majority of survey respondents (85%) see sustainability as a value creation opportunity for their long-term corporate strategy, and half of companies say it is a \"very significant\" reason for pursuing a sustainability strategy. Other top motivations are regulatory compliance and a company\u2019s moral responsibilities. Expectations from external stakeholders such as lenders and wider civil society saw much lower response rates.\n\nThe top barrier deemed \"very significant\" to delivering on sustainability efforts is the high level of required investment (31%), followed by conflicts with the financial goals of the company (28%) and macroeconomic uncertainty (25%). Overall, investment needs ranked 1.5 times higher compared to other barriers, such as lack of corporate leadership or employee skills.\n\nKey survey findings include:\n\nFinancing Sustainability Strategies: Respondents indicate that access to capital is vital, with 84% saying support from investors is important to deliver their sustainability strategies. 76% believe that sustainability measures could drive a lower cost of equity and/or debt for their company over the next five years. Only 42% say they are meeting or exceeding expectations around aligning corporate financing with their sustainability strategy. Integration of Sustainability into Business Decisions: A majority of companies (55%) say their key business functions \u2013 including capital expenditures, research and development, new products and mergers and acquisitions \u2013 are subject to sustainability criteria. However, just over one third agreed that their company\u2019s board has sustainability expertise. The most commonly cited shortfall in board expertise is around sustainability-related regulations (57%). Impact of Climate Change on Business: Nearly all respondents (92%) expect climate change to impact their business model by 2050, with 23% noting that it already has made an impact. This puts climate on par with more traditional business risks including technological change, competitor actions, geopolitical conflict and supply chain instability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Sustainable Signals series was launched in 2015 and measures the views of individual investors, institutional investors and business on sustainable investing. The first survey of corporates in the series, the new report is being released in conjunction with Morgan Stanley\u2019s 2024 Sustainable Finance Summit (May 21-22, New York), an annual conference that brings together leaders across sectors to discuss the latest trends in sustainable investing.\n\nView the full results of the Sustainable Signals survey here.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services.

Historical data shown represents past performance and does not guarantee comparable future results. Certain statements herein may be \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future results or occurrences and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond our control. In addition, this report contains statements based on hypothetical scenarios and assumptions, which may not occur or differ significantly from actual events, and these statements should not necessarily be viewed as being representative of current or actual risk or forecasts of expected risk. Actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Morgan Stanley speak only as to the date they are made, and Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.\n\nCertain portfolios may include investment holdings deemed Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") investments. For reference, environmental (\"E\") factors can include, but are not limited to, climate change, pollution, waste, and how an issuer protects and/ or conserves natural resources. Social (\"S\") factors can include, but not are not limited to, how an issuer manages its relationships with individuals, such as its employees, shareholders, and customers as well as its community. Governance (\"G\") factors can include, but are not limited to, how an issuer operates, such as its leadership composition, pay and incentive structures, internal controls, and the rights of equity and debt holders. You should carefully review an investment product\u2019s prospectus or other offering documents, disclosures and/or marketing material to learn more about how it incorporates ESG factors into its investment strategy.\n\nESG investments may also be referred to as sustainable investments, impact aware investments, socially responsible investments or diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\") investments. It is important to understand there are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. This is due to a current lack of consistent global reporting and auditing standards as well as differences in definitions, methodologies, processes, data sources and subjectivity among ESG rating providers when determining a rating. Certain issuers of investments including, but not limited to, separately managed accounts (SMAs), mutual funds and exchange traded-funds (ETFs) may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. Further, socially responsible norms vary by region, and an issuer\u2019s ESG practices or Morgan Stanley\u2019s assessment of an issuer\u2019s ESG practices can change over time.\n\nPortfolios that include investment holdings deemed ESG investments or that employ ESG screening criteria as part of an overall strategy may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results. For risks related to a specific fund, please refer to the fund\u2019s prospectus or summary prospectus.\n\nInvestment managers can have different approaches to ESG and can offer strategies that differ from the strategies offered by other investment managers with respect to the same theme or topic. Additionally, when evaluating investments, an investment manager is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the manager to incorrectly assess an investment\u2019s ESG characteristics or performance. Such data or information may be obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. Morgan Stanley does not verify that such information and data is accurate and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy, timeliness, or completeness when evaluating an issuer. This can cause Morgan Stanley to incorrectly assess an issuer\u2019s business practices with respect to its ESG practices. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products.\n\nThe appropriateness of a particular ESG investment or strategy will depend on an investor\u2019s individual circumstances and objectives. Principal value and return of an investment will fluctuate with changes in market conditions.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. Members SIPC.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s consumer spending unexpectedly slowed in April while industrial production accelerated, highlighting the lopsided recovery of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019 Dow Average Touches 40,000 Before Pulling Back: Markets Wrap\n\nRetail sales expanded 2.3%, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday, worse than a projected 3.7% expansion by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Industrial output rose 6.7% in April from a year ago, faster than a median estimate of 5.5%.\n\nChina\u2019s export-driven manufacturing sector has powered the world\u2019s No. 2 economy this year, as a housing crisis continues to weigh on domestic demand. Exports returned to growth in April and factory activity expanded for a second month. But consumer prices remained sluggish, and credit shrank for the first time since 2005.\n\nGrowth in fixed-asset investment was 4.2% in the first four months of the year, weaker than a forecast 4.6% gain. Investment in property development declined 9.8%, worsening from the first quarter.\n\nThe urban jobless rate was 5%, down from 5.2% as of the end of March.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s government has signaled more support is coming. Beijing will start selling its 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) ultra-long special sovereign bonds Friday, which could fund infrastructure spending critical to growth. That\u2019s spurred expectations of monetary easing to help banks buy the notes.\n\nChina is also mulling a plan for local governments to snap up millions of unsold homes, Bloomberg earlier reported. Top leaders previously hinted at more stimulus for the property sector, vowing to study measures to reduce inventory.\n\nOther risks remain. The Communist Party\u2019s focus on ramping up China\u2019s clean energy sectors has stoked tensions overseas, with the US and European Union complaining a deluge of cheap goods are threatening jobs in their domestic markets.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Up 11.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Morgan Stanley (MS). Shares have added about 11.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Morgan Stanley due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nMorgan Stanley Q1 Earnings Beat as IB Business Rebounds\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings of $2.02 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. The bottom line compared favorably with $1.70 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThough advisory fees declined 28% year over year, underwriting fees witnessed solid improvement in the quarter. Specifically, equity underwriting income jumped 113% and fixed income underwriting income was up 37%. So, total IB fees (in the Institutional Securities division) grew 16% to $1.45 billion. We had projected it to be $1.26 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company also posted a decent trading performance. Equity trading revenues increased 4% year over year, while fixed-income trading income declined 4%.\r\n\r\nA provision benefit was another tailwind for Morgan Stanley.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite a 30% increase in interest income, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) declined due to higher interest expenses. Also, an increase in total non-interest expenses was a headwind.\r\n\r\nNet income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP) was $3.27 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $2.69 billion.\n\nRevenues Improve, Expenses Rise\n\nQuarterly net revenues were $15.14 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion.\r\n\r\nNII was $1.8 billion, down 23%. We had projected NII of $1.89 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest revenues of $13.34 billion increased 10%. Our estimate for the metric was $12.51 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest expenses were $10.74 billion, up 2%. Our estimate for expenses was $10.67 billion.\r\n\r\nProvision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million against a provision expense of $234 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nQuarterly Segment Performance\n\nInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income was $2.35 billion, up 24% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same was $1.65 billion.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $7.02 billion, up 3% year over year. The upside resulted from increased underwriting revenues and equity trading revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.33 billion.\r\n\r\nWealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $1.81 billion, up 5% year over year. Our estimate for this was the same as the reported number.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $6.88 billion, up 5%, driven by higher asset management revenues and transactional revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.82 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal client assets were $5.5 trillion as of Mar 31, 2024, up 21% year over year. We had projected the metric to be $5.03 trillion.\r\n\r\nInvestment Management: Pre-tax income was $241 million, jumping 45% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $241.5 million.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $1.38 billion, up 7%. The improvement is attributable to a rise in asset management and related fees. We had projected revenues of $1.4 billion.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, total assets under management or supervision were $1.51 trillion, up 10% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.47 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Position Solid\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, the book value per share was $55.60, up from $55.13 in the corresponding period of 2022. The tangible book value per share was $41.07, up from $40.68 as of Mar 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 17.2% compared with 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.3%, down from 15.6% a year ago.\n\nShare Repurchase Update\n\nIn the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley repurchased 12 million shares for $1 billion.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nManagement expects the Institutional Securities segment NII to be relatively stable in the second quarter on a sequential basis.\r\n\r\nGiven the current macroeconomic headwinds, wealth management segment pre-tax margins are estimated to be in the mid-20% range.\r\n\r\nThe tax rate is expected to be almost 23%.\n\nLong-Term Objectives\n\nThe company expects an ROTCE of 20% or more. The efficiency ratio is expected to be less than 70%.\r\n\r\nFor the WM segment, the pre-tax margin is projected at more than 30%. Across the WM and IM segments, total client assets are expected to be $10 trillion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Morgan Stanley has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Morgan Stanley has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nMorgan Stanley belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry. Another stock from the same industry, Goldman Sachs (GS), has gained 15.4% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nGoldman reported revenues of $14.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $11.58 for the same period compares with $8.79 a year ago.\n\nGoldman is expected to post earnings of $8.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +187.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.5%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of F.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Travel Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "Summer will be here before you know it. For many individuals and families, that means taking a vacation of some sort. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to look for travel stocks to buy.\n\nDespite expectations that the consumer hunger for travel is abating, the evidence shows a different picture. According to a survey of 2,000 U.S. Adults conducted by The Harris Poll for NerdWallet, approximately 45% of Americans plan to take a flight or stay in a hotel this summer. That means there could be over $400 billion spent on airfare and hotel costs alone this summer.\n\nIn fairness, the survey also showed that approximately 22% of those surveyed cited inflation as a reason that they wouldn\u2019t be traveling. And those that are traveling plan to pay for some or all of their travel with credit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, at this point, you have two choices. You can choose to do nothing. Or you can look for some attractive travel stocks to buy. If you choose the latter, here are three names that multiple analysts are rewarding with a strong buy rating.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Inside the airplane cabin of a Delta flight.\n\nSource: EQRoy / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite a gain of nearly 60% in the last 12 months, shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are still about 6% below their March 2020 levels. The market has been slow to embrace airline stocks in general despite record demand in the sector.\n\nHowever, Delta is making a case that\u2019s hard to ignore. In April, they beat analysts\u2019 expectations on the top and bottom line and both numbers were higher year-over-year (YOY). The company is forecasting strong demand for both international and business travel. After taking on debt in 2020, the airline is now forecasting free cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2024. Plus, in 2023, Delta reinstated the dividend it suspended in 2020.\n\nOut of 22 analysts to issue a rating on DAL stock, 18 have a strong buy rating. That speaks to the value they see in the stock. The consensus price target is over $60. InvestorPlace writer Will Ashworth points out the most bullish of those targets comes from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) which has an $85 price target. As Ashworth notes, Delta has never traded higher than $70.\n\nExpedia Group (EXPE) building facade with expedia (EXPE) group logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn its most recent earnings report in May 2024, Expedia Group (NYSE:EXPE) reported slower revenue growth than what it recorded in the prior quarter. And, for the second consecutive quarter, EXPE stock tumbled sharply after an otherwise good earnings report.\n\nThis could be a case of analysts expecting the travel boom to become a bust. But, as we noted in the introduction, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. And that bodes well for Expedia which, in addition to being a travel planning site, is the host of VRBO and hotels.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nEXPE stock is covered by 36 analysts. Of those analysts, 12 give the stock a strong buy rating. And despite the 25% pullback in 2024, shareholders are still sitting on a 26% gain over the last 12 months. Analysts have a consensus price target of approximately $149 for the stock which is 32% above its closing price on May 13, 2024.\n\nCamping World (CWH) Camping World Holdings logo on a computer screen. CWH stock.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock\n\nCamping World (NYSE:CWH) is one of the best-performing stocks in 2020 and 2021 as many Americans discovered or rekindled their desire for recreational vehicles (RVs). And the stock has held much of those gains. It\u2019s up 89% in the last five years.\n\nBut, CWH stock is down 10% in the last 12 months. This makes sense because consumers who are looking to buy RVs are sensitive to interest rates. Earnings and revenue are down YOY.\n\nAlso, the company cut its dividend, which was raised by nearly 500% between 2020 and 2021 is now below 2020 levels. While this is certainly a prudent move, it did take away one of the more compelling reasons to own the stock.\n\nNevertheless, nine out of 12 analysts have a strong buy rating on the stock. And the consensus price target of $28.27 implies a 24.6% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Airbnb Stock (NASDAQ:ABNB): Expanding Scale to Drive More Growth",
        "content": "Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), one of the largest accommodation booking platforms in the world, saw its stock tumble 7% last week after reporting first-quarter earnings. Despite short-term challenges, Airbnb is poised for continued growth aided by its growing scale, which presents investors with another opportunity to consider investing in it.\n\nThe company has introduced several new features to lure new guests and hosts to the platform and is also investing in AI to boost the booking experience for both parties. I am bullish on Airbnb, as I believe the company will take market share from other online travel agencies in the next five years.\n\nA Slowdown in Demand Is in the Cards\n\nThe travel industry made a soaring comeback in the last couple of years after dealing with COVID-related challenges in 2020 and 2021. The pent-up demand for travel helped Airbnb register exponential growth, but this year, travel demand is projected to normalize.\n\nThere are two main reasons behind these expectations for normalizing travel demand.\n\nFirst, consumer spending power has rapidly deteriorated in recent times due to persistently elevated inflation. In the U.S., excess savings in the pandemic era have been fully depleted. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, cumulative pandemic-era excess savings hit a high of $2.1 trillion in August 2021, but by March 2024, excess savings declined to a negative $72 billion. Given this, consumers are highly unlikely to splurge on travel as they used to in the last two years.\n\nSecond, travel inflation is on the rise again, which suggests traveling will cost more money in the foreseeable future. This, in turn, will spook consumers. According to NerdWallet\u2019s Travel Inflation Report for May, the cost of traveling is rising across key categories. In March, Airfare prices increased by 1% compared to February, while hotel room rates increased by a more pronounced 6.7%. Rental car prices also saw an uptick of 5.7%. Restaurant and theatre prices largely remained flat.\n\nTravel costs are increasing, while consumers are taking a hit due to persistent inflation, and this combination is likely to deteriorate travel demand in the foreseeable future.\n\nAsia Will be a Bright Spot\n\nAccording to Skift Research, 2024 will be one of the best years in recent memory for the travel sector in Asia. After struggling with mobility restrictions, Chinese travelers are finally getting back to traveling, and the research firm expects the Asia travel market to grow this year while Europe takes a back seat.\n\nAirbnb is strategically placing bets in Asia to benefit from this projected travel boom. The company has identified several growth markets, including India, China, and Korea, and is focused on investing in these markets to lure travelers. These investments include improving the localization of products to cater to locally popular payment methods and supporting more languages.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the company is updating the mobile app in China to offer a more familiar experience to Chinese consumers. They are also marketing the platform as a youth-friendly online travel agency, appealing to young travelers who are likely to prefer Airbnb lodgings over hotel rooms.\n\nScale Will be a Growth Driver\n\nOver the years, Airbnb has expanded its product offering and the end markets it serves. The company seems well-positioned to convert this scale advantage into tangible earnings.\n\nAccording to company filings, Airbnb currently operates in 220 countries and regions. At the end of 2023, the platform had more than five million hosts and had accommodated over 1.5 billion guests since its founding in 2007. The company, therefore, seems to enjoy a network effect where the massive number of hosts attracts more guests and vice versa. This network effect may prove to be a long-lasting competitive advantage.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s expansion into new product categories should also help the company\u2019s growth. The Experiences segment is one area the company is trying to reinvest itself in. Since mid-2022, Airbnb has slowly phased out the Experiences segment despite previously claiming that the addressable market opportunity in this segment eclipsed $1.4 trillion.\n\nDuring the Q1 earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky revealed that the company is bringing Experiences back to the platform and trying to rebrand it to support not just stays but other travel booking verticals.\n\nThe launch of Airbnb Icons earlier this year resonates well with these ambitions. This new category allows users to book a wide array of experiences and events, from sports to music. Airbnb\u2019s expansion into these new segments will expand its addressable market opportunity meaningfully in the coming years.\n\nAirbnb Luxe, which caters to high-end travelers by offering luxury accommodation options, and Airbnb for Work, which caters to professionals who are on work trips or working remotely, are two other new products that are likely to contribute positively to earnings growth in the long run.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s growing scale will be its biggest growth driver in the next five years.\n\nIs Airbnb a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts had mixed reactions to Airbnb\u2019s first-quarter earnings. Jefferies analysts concluded that Airbnb\u2019s failure to raise the outlook for expected Nights and Experiences for the next quarter suggests growth is slowing. The research firm also raised concerns about the seemingly disappointing outlook for EBITDA. Jefferies has a price target of $150 for Airbnb, along with a Hold rating.\n\nJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised the price target from $140 to $145, as it believes the company\u2019s continued innovation will open new opportunities to grow.\n\nBoth Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Evercore ISI analysts highlighted growth concerns and identified the management\u2019s lackluster guidance for Q2 as the biggest factor contributing to the negative market sentiment toward Airbnb following the earnings print.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 36 Wall Street analysts, Airbnb stock comes in as a Hold, and the average ABNB stock price target is $152.97, which implies upside potential of just 4.9% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Airbnb\u2019s Long-Term Prospects Remain Bright\n\nAirbnb seems fairly valued based on Wall Street rankings revealed in this analysis, and the company is facing short-term headwinds that may limit growth in the next few quarters. However, the company is well-positioned to grow in the long term, aided by its growing scale and diversification into new product categories.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Morgan Stanley Obtains $700M Property Loan From Blackstone Venture\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has entered into a deal to acquire around $700 million of property loans from the failed Signature Bank through a consortium.\n\nThe consortium involves Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Rialto Capital.\n\nThe transaction, marks a significant move in the commercial-property finance arena, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle Inc (NYSE:JLL) advised on the sale. Representatives for Blackstone, CPPIB, and Morgan Stanley opted not to provide comments.\n\nLast year, Blackstone and associates secured a share in a partnership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which held about $17 billion worth of Signature property loans.\n\nHowever, the FDIC has yet to issue a statement regarding Morgan Stanley\u2019s recent acquisition.\n\nInitially, the consortium explored the possibility of selling a portion of the loan portfolio, specifically about $1.8 billion in performing loans, primarily for apartment buildings.\n\nThe fate of the remaining portion of these loans remains uncertain. The sale of Signature property loans has attracted investor attention amid a sluggish market for commercial-property transactions, Bloomberg writes.\n\nLast year U.S. regulators shut down Signature Bank, the third financial institution to be shut after Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp.\n\nWith rising borrowing costs and declining valuations, transactions like the Signature loan sales offer insights into the true value of properties and their associated debts.\n\nPrice Action: MS shares are trading higher by 0.96% at $100.33 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Morgan Stanley Gets New Tech Team Leader \u2013 Veteran Crystal Zhu From JPMorgan\n\nPhoto by Sven Piper on Unsplash\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Morgan Stanley Obtains $700M Property Loan From Blackstone Venture originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Mid-Q2 2024 Investor Conference and Events Highlights Update",
        "content": "The bulls cleared another hurdle. The first-quarter earnings season has been strong. With 92% of S&P 500 companies reporting, the earnings per share beat rate is 78%, near the five-year average. More impressive is the updated first-quarter year-over-year earnings growth rate, which, according to FactSet, now stands at 5.40%, significantly above the 3.40% figure from the end of March.[1] What's more, year-over-year earnings growth estimates for the second quarter have ticked up, from 9% on March 31 to 9.60% as of May 3. Calendar-year S&P 500 per-share earnings are now seen near $244, actually rising in recent weeks, bucking the normal trend of declining earnings per share forecasts during a given year.\n\nWhere's the slowdown?\n\nContinued decent consumer spending, heavy corporate capital expenditure trends (thank you, artificial intelligence) and beefy profit margins all contribute to an environment conducive to both resilient economic output and record company profits. And though the first-quarter U.S. GDP print came in lower than expected, mainly due to weak net export activity and a decline in business inventory, early signs point to an acceleration in the economic expansion rate this quarter.[2]\n\nRate cuts on the horizon in Europe\n\nSo, despite some dire predictions of tepid U.S. real GDP growth in 2024, particularly during the middle of the year, it appears to be a pretty good time if you're a CEO at a multinational corporation. (Alas, we are merely data analysts and researchers!) But things are fine on that front, too, as the unemployment rate in the U.S. remains not far from multidecade lows while the inflation trajectory is generally heading in the right direction. There are even better consumer price trends in overseas markets with the potential for rate cuts sooner rather than later in some developed ex-U.S. economies.[3]\n\nStocks snap back, foreign markets perk up\n\nIn terms of the markets, equities seemed to have gotten through a dose of April malaise. The S&P 500 notched a strong start to May while other countries, namely the U.K., have seen their home indexes notch fresh highs.[4] Even China, a chronic underperformer since early 2021, has enjoyed a quick bullish turnaround, now up by more than 30% from its January nadir. There are clearly some macro tailwinds at play, but investors surely know that volatility can lurk right around the corner. There was a similar feeling of optimism early last summer before a 10% correction reset the playing field before year-end.\n\nConference activity heats back up\n\nWith the bulk of first-quarter earnings reports in the bag, the focus shifts to reading between the lines at corporate conferences. Investment meeting gatherings of top executives, thought leaders, industry experts and Wall Street analysts often produce key insights into the state of narrow niches of the economy. By piecing together tidbits of intel here and there, investors can gain a better understanding of where risk and opportunity may soon assert themselves. Here are some of the major investor conferences on the docket for the balance of the second quarter:\n\nStory continues\n\nInformation Technology & Communication Services\n\nMay 14: Google I/O Developers ConferenceMay 20: JP Morgan 52nd Annual TMT Global Technology Media and Communications ConferenceMay 29: Goldman Sachs Global Semiconductor ConferenceJune 4: Bank of America Global Technology ConferenceJune 5: Citi Regional Tech ConferenceJune 10: Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)June 12: Bank of America Securities Global Technology ConferenceJune 12: Mizuho Technology Conference\n\nHealth Care\n\nMay 14: Capital One Securities 1st Annual Biotech/Biopharma Disrupters EventMay 14: RBC Capital Markets Global Healthcare ConferenceMay 14: Bank of America Securities Global Healthcare ConferenceMay 23: UBS Obesity Therapeutics DayJune 5: Jefferies Global Healthcare ConferenceJune 5: UBS Health Care Services Cape Cod SummitJune 10: Goldman Sachs 45th Annual Global Healthcare ConferenceJune 18: Citi's European Healthcare Conference, LondonJune 20: JP Morgan European Healthcare Conference\n\nConsumer Discretionary & Consumer Staples\n\nMay 14: Goldman Sachs Global Staples ForumMay 18: National Restaurant Association ShowMay 20: Electric Vehicle Innovation SummitMay 21: HSBC Consumer ConferenceMay 23: HSBC 17th Luxury Goods ConferenceJune 4: Morgan Stanley 2nd Annual Travel & Leisure ConferenceJune 4: Bank of America Securities Housing SymposiumJune 4: Deutsche Bank 21st Annual dbAccess Global Consumer ConferenceJune 11: Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry ConferenceJune 11: Evercore ISI 4th Annual Consumer & Retail Conference\n\nFinancials & Real Estate\n\nMay 14: Wells Fargo Financial Services Investor ConferenceMay 14: JP Morgan Insurance ForumMay 14: Janney Montgomery Scott Forth Annual Real Estate ConferenceMay 21: Barclays Leveraged Finance ConferenceMay 29: RBC Capital Markets Virtual Mid-Cap Bank Fixed Income Investor Conference (virtual)May 29: Deutsche Bank AG 14th Annual Global Financial Services ConferenceJune 10: Morgan Stanley 15th Annual US Financials Payments & CRE Conference\n\nIndustrials\n\nMay 15: Bank of America Global Industrials ConferenceMay 21: Wolfe Research 17th Annual Global Transportation & Industrials ConferenceJune 18: Citi Global Freight Field TripJune 11: Wells Fargo Industrials ConferenceJune 24: Goldman Sachs Business Services, Transport & Leisure Conference\n\nEnergy & Utilities\n\nMay 14: Citi's Energy and Climate Technology ConferenceMay 16: Deutsche Bank Global Solar & Clean Tech Conference (virtual)May 16: RBC Future of Water ConferenceMay 18: American Gas Association (AGA) Financial ForumMay 20: JP Morgan Hydrogen Week (virtual)June 3: RBC Capital Markets Global Energy, Power, and Infrastructure ConferenceJune 6: Bank of America Energy Credit ConferenceJune 11: Evercore ISI 3rd Annual Global Clean Energy & Transition Technologies SummitJune 17: JP Morgan Energy, Power & Renewables Conference\n\nMaterials\n\nMay 14: Citi Chemicals ConferenceMay 14: JP Morgan Homebuilding & Building Products ConferenceMay 21: JP Morgan Homebuilders DayMay 22: Raymond James Silver Equities ConferenceMay 28: KeyBanc Capital Markets Industrials & Basic Materials ConferenceJune 13: RBC Capital Markets Global Mining and Materials Conference\n\nRegional\n\nMay 14: Morgan Stanley EEMEA ConferenceMay 15: JP Morgan European Technology, Media, and Telecoms TMT ConferenceMay 16: Morgan Stanley ASEAN Conference (virtual)May 24: Morgan Stanley Flagship Asia Tech Corporate DayMay 27: UBS Asian Investment ConferenceMay 31: Citi Pan Asia Regional Investor ConferenceJune 3: Goldman Sachs Annual European Financial Services ConferenceJune 5: Morgan Stanley China TMT ConferenceJune 6: JP Morgan Frontier Markets Fixed Income Conference\n\nInvestor Specific & Multi-Sector\n\nMay 14: UBS Pan European Small and Mid-Cap ConferenceMay 15: JP Morgan Global Markets ConferenceMay 29: Bank of America Securities Emerging Markets Debt & Equity ConferenceJune 4: Stifel Cross Sector Insight ConferenceJune 5: Deutsche Bank dbAccess 15th Annual Global Industrials, Materials & Building Products ConferenceJune 11: Bank of America C-Suite SMID ConferenceJune 12: Sidoti June Small-Cap ConferenceJune 26: Morningstar Investment Conference\n\n[1] Earnings Insight, FactSet, John Butters, May 10, 2024, https://advantage.factset.com[2] Slow, but solid US economic growth anticipated in Q1; inflation likely heats up, Reuters, Lucia Mutikani, April 25, 2024, https://www.reuters.com[3] Euro zone inflation steady at 2.4%, keeping June rate cut in play as economy returns to growth, CNBC, Jenni Reid, April 30, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com[4] FTSE 100 hits record high, pound slips ahead of BoE verdict, Reuters, Pranav Kashyap, Shubham Batra,Khushi Singh, May 8, 2024, https://www.reuters.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

Representatives for Blackstone, CPPIB, and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while spokespeople for Rialto and JLL didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\n\nLast year, Blackstone and its partners acquired a stake in a joint venture with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that held about $17 billion of Signature property loans.

It\u2019s unclear what will happen to the other portion of those loans.\n\nSales of Signature property loans have drawn investor interest as the market for commercial-property deals remains sluggish.

        "content": "In life, whether looking for the best financial stocks to buy or the best way to get rich quickly, imitation can be the best form of flattery. Barron\u2019s published an article about bank-stock fund manager David Ellison\u2019s portfolio of financial services stocks in his Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund (MUTF:HLFNX).\n\nEllison has spent 41 years working in the investment industry, the past 27 years running this Hennessey fund and the Hennessey Small Cap Financial Fund (MUTF:HSFNX). He\u2019s been with the fund for so long that it underwent a change in ownership when his old firm, FBR Funds, was acquired by Hennessey in 2012.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t think an old-school fund manager would own a stock like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), but it\u2019s the large-cap fund\u2019s sixth-largest holding, accounting for 5.41% of its net assets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile some excellent names are in the top 10 holdings, here are three other financial stocks to buy from one of Wall Street\u2019s longest-serving fund managers.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is Ellison\u2019s 12th-largest holding with a 4.81% weighting.\n\nFormer CEO James Gorman, who stepped down in January and became executive chairman of the investment bank, held the top job for 14 years. During that time, MS shares appreciated by 215%, less than the 323% of the S&P 500, but significantly higher than the 133% return for the Dow Jones U.S. Banks Index. It\u2019s all relative.\n\nAs a January Fortune.com article reminded investors, Morgan Stanley generated most of its revenue from traditional banking and capital markets trading when Gorman took over. He pushed the company hard into asset and wealth management.\n\nAs a result, revenues grew from $16.4 billion in 2010 to $54.14 billion in 2023, with wealth management accounting for nearly 50% of annual revenue.\n\nTwo acquisitions in 2020 also helped it grow revenues, $13 billion for E-Trade and $7 billion for Eaton Vance. The wealth management business will continue to drive its growth.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A ,BRK-B) is Ellison\u2019s 15th-largest holding with a 4.29% weighting.\n\nOne of the big announcements by Warren Buffett and Berkshire in the holding company\u2019s Q1 2024 results released in early May was the 13% reduction in its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings. Berkshire\u2019s most significant sale was 117 million shares of Apple stock, more than the 93.5 million shares it sold in 2020.\n\nBuffett likes Apple, he called it a better business than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) at its annual meeting in Omaha. However, he wants to keep adding to the company\u2019s cash position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s cash position as of March 31 was more than $188 billion. If its cash were an S&P 500 company, it would be the 42nd largest.\u00a0Of course, it doesn\u2019t hurt that it makes more than $8 billion annually in income from this cash. Who wouldn\u2019t like it?\n\nWith meme-stock mania back in full force, I think his actions make a lot of sense.\n\nTruist Financial (TFC) Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nTruist Financial (NYSE:TFC) is Ellison\u2019s 21st-largest holding with a 1.99% weighting. TFC stock is up nearly 41% over the past year.\n\nAnalysts are lukewarm about the financial stock. Of 23 analysts, 12 rate it a buy with a $43 target, about 10% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading. Understandably, it would be a smaller holding of Ellison\u2019s.\n\nOn May 7, Truist announced the sale of its remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings to a consortium of private equity investors, including Stone Point Capital, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Mubadala Investment Company and other co-investors.\n\n\u201cThe sale of TIH significantly enhances Truist\u2019s financial profile and positions Truist to invest in and grow its core banking businesses,\u201d CEO Bill Rogers stated in the transaction\u2019s press release.\n\nMoody\u2019s downgraded Truist\u2019s long-term senior unsecured debt to Baa1 from A3. There\u2019s a difference of opinion about the pros and cons of the deal.\n\nWhile the sale improved the bank\u2019s liquidity and capitalization, Moody\u2019s argues it did so at the expense of revenue diversification. It now has to rely on the net interest income of its lending business, potentially leading to greater earnings volatility.\n\nIt\u2019s a riskier bet that could pay off for aggressive investors and seasoned investment pros such as Ellison.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s record with stock predictions is probably no better than throwing a dart at a target. They seem to get just as many calls wrong as they do right (if not more). But the market can move after an analyst makes a call and the firms offer some valuable insights into a company and its industry, especially when you\u2019re looking for which stocks to buy.\n\nThat\u2019s why keeping an eye on how they view individual companies is not a bad idea. Big money investors and institutions do make decisions based on their recommendations that can influence a stock\u2019s direction.\n\nBelow are three stocks to buy Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts raised their price targets on. Based on their current price levels, the outlook suggests significant double-digit returns are possible over the next year. Let\u2019s see whether these analysts got them right.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast month Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) from equal-weight to overweight and raised his price target on the stock from $74 per share to $85 per share.\n\nAt the time the merchant services platform was trading just under $70 per share, indicating the analyst saw some 20% upside potential but after reporting first quarter results two weeks later, Shopify stock tumbled sharply, and now it sits below $59 per share.\n\nThere was good reason to think Shopify would continue growing, and there still is. The merchant services business is the \u201csecond biggest checkout in the U.S.\u201d and handles approximately 11% of e-commerce sales in the country.\n\nWhile its initial focus was on helping small businesses gain an online presence, today Shopify counts large, multinational corporations in its customer mix.\n\nYet last week it reported earnings that missed guidance expectations. Topline results beat the Street\u2019s view, but management forecasts for second quarter revenue were shy of analyst predicts.\n\nOperating margin outlook was also less than expected. Weiss subsequently lowered his target price to $80 per share while keeping the overweight rating.\n\nThat still implies 35% upside and seems a good bet to happen considering its ability to generate significant free cash flow making this one of the stocks to buy for continued growth.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalyst Ravi Shanker raised his price target on United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) to $80 from $75 per share last month while maintaining his overweight rating on the stock.\n\nAt the time the stock was trading at around $51 a share so it implied a hefty 57% increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited has just reported strong quarterly earnings that featured a smaller than expected loss. The ongoing problems at Boeing (NYSE:BA) should not interfere with the airline\u2019s long-term performance.\n\nAlthough United took a $200 million hit related to Boeing grounding its MAX 9 planes following an incident earlier this year with a door plug popping off midflight, the aircraft manufacturer was going to reimburse the airline for its costs.\n\nWithout that charge, though, United would have reported a profit United Airlines stock surged.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously an upbeat outlook around the airline and shares are trading slightly higher since Shanker raised his target price, making this one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nThere is still 51% upside baked into the stock, though Morgan Stanley is on the high side of Wall Street target prices. Others peg United more around $70 per share, which would still represent a decent profit on where it stands today.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) got its target price nudged slightly higher by analyst Andrew Percoco who pushed it from $245 per share to $248 per share while reiterating an overweight rating.\n\nHe\u2019s been very bullish on the solar panel stock for sometime and has been incrementally raising his target price.\n\nPreviously he told investors in a research note, \u201cWe believe First Solar offers one of the strongest risk-adjusted earnings profiles\u201d as it benefits from a \u201cnear-term competitive moat.\u201d\n\nFirst Solar stock has been steadily rising from its low point last November and now stands 48% above that level. The current price target the Morgan Stanley analyst assigned earlier this month suggests there\u2019s at least another 30% hike to come over the next year.\n\nIt might be more difficult from here though. Higher interest rates, of course, will continue to weigh on installations as will ongoing pricing pressure from Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement expressed concern about cheap panels flooding the market through an \u201cintentional structural overcapacity\u201d as China attempts to dominate the industry.\n\nFirst Solar has done well commanding a bit of a premium for its panels but bookings volume is flat at 2.7 gigawatts compared to the 2.7 gigawatts of sales volume sold. Further, because it has been living off the Section 45x tax credit credits, it\u2019s a long-term risk if those credits dry up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) strategists are urging investors to snap up U.S. government bonds, even if the economy doesn\u2019t slow down. They believe bond yields could fall dramatically driven by \u201cresidual seasonality,\u201d a statistical quirk that can sway economic data even after seasonal adjustments. This could lead to predicting a more rapid decline in inflation than the market is currently pricing in, and three stocks to sell in light of MS\u2019s prediction.\n\nAs bond yields fall, bond prices rise. However, the cooling of inflation can also adversely affect companies in different sectors of the economy. Reduced inflation makes sectors that range from energy to real estate less attractive, but it should be noted that residual seasonality should be part of a broader bearish thesis.\n\nThese three stocks to sell have residual seasonality to their original bear case, strengthening the decision to sell the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, may be vulnerable to shifts in energy prices influenced by global economic changes. While typically resilient during high inflation due to increased oil prices, a sudden shift to lower inflation could reduce its operating margins.\n\nPeople typically buy stocks like XOM for their stability and high dividends. I believe that XOM could be headed for trouble given that the long-term future of the fossil fuels industry is subject to a massive change due to our transition to carbon-free alternatives.\n\nXOM, therefore, isn\u2019t one of those dividend stocks one can hold forever and forget about. Indeed, the consensus from five analysts suggests that XOM\u2019s EPS will fall around the FY2027 mark, slipping into negative territory.\n\nWhen comparing the outlook of XOM to other dividend stocks like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW), there is a far stronger confidence that its EPS will continue to climb steadily into the future, thus making XOM a riskier option and one of those companies that investors should consider selling.\n\nWells Fargo & Company (WFC) Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grass\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified financial services company. Given the potential for lower interest rates following periods of high inflation, their profit margins on loans and other financial products may be compressed.\n\nWells Fargo stock slid 2.1% in April after guiding that its key net interest income metric could fall 7-9% this year due to higher deposit costs and lower loan demand, raising concerns about the bank\u2019s outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we are near the peak of the interest rate cycle (which has recently benefited stocks in the financial sector more than it has hurt them), we continue to buy stocks like WFC and are also buying near their peaks.\n\nOne could instead take profit from their positions of XOM and WFC and rotate into companies due to lower inflation and lower interest rates, such as growth stocks or ETFs, which could benefit from this backdrop.\n\nSimon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is a prominent real estate investment trust known for owning, developing and managing retail real estate, particularly malls and shopping centers.\n\nWith lower inflation, there may be less upward pressure on retail prices, potentially leading to diminished revenue growth for tenants in SPG\u2019s malls and shopping centers.\n\nSince we\u2019ve seen inflation rise at a breakneck pace, and consumers have already been stretched close to their maximum price elasticity, with the cost of living likely to be a key theme in the U.S. election,\u00a0it makes more sense to believe that the subsequent retail price increases will be far more moderate moving forward.\n\nOther factors involved in SPG\u2019s bear case are its moderating dividend growth rate after the COVID lockdown and its high payout ratio, which suggests that it may not be able to continue paying out its 5.42% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Publicly Traded Financial Companies in the US.\n\nNavigating the Financial Landscape\n\nThe finance sector plays a crucial role in the economic well-being of any country. Encompassing a wide range of industries, including banking, insurance, and investment management, the finance sector facilitates the flow of capital and enables businesses and individuals to access the resources they need to invest, grow, and thrive. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global financial services market was estimated to have reached a value of $31.13 trillion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.6% from 2024 to 2028 to reach a value of $44.92 trillion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe United States is home to one of the biggest financial markets in the world. However, the finance sector is faced with a myriad of challenges that are shaping the industry's landscape. These challenges include regulatory complexity, technological disruption, cybersecurity threats, and economic uncertainty. On May 6, Reuters reported that in the first quarter of 2024, US banks observed a decrease in the demand for industrial loans and a drop in household credit demand, as per a Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers. The survey revealed that the net share of large and medium-sized banks tightening standards for commercial and industrial loans increased to reach up to 15.6%, while demand for these loans weakened. The tightening of standards for commercial real estate loans decreased to a two-year low, with foreign banks experiencing increased demand for such loans. Regarding household loans, more banks tightened standards for auto loans, while fewer did so for credit cards and other consumer loans. Overall, household loan demand decreased across all categories, with demand for auto loans at its weakest over the past year.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about countries with the most developed financial markets, you can also take a look at the Insider Monkey Global Financial Development Index.\n\nA Closer Look at the Top Financial Companies in the US\n\nA number of companies within the finance industry have demonstrated remarkable resilience, adapting to the shifting landscape and capitalizing on emerging opportunities to drive growth.

        "title": "Private equity is helping banks shed some of their risks",
        "content": "Troubled regional lender New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) is trying to show investors that it is getting a better handle on the risks embedded in its massive loan book.\n\nOne option: Shift some of those risks to private equity firms or Wall Street money managers.\n\n\"We are right at the doorstep of deciding whether we're going to move forward\" on such an arrangement, Joseph Otting, NYCB CEO, told analysts earlier this month.\n\nThe potential transaction for NYCB is what\u2019s known as a credit risk transfer \u2014 and it\u2019s quickly becoming one of the hottest ways for banks to alleviate their regulatory burdens, protect against future losses, and navigate through a challenging period for the industry.\n\nThese transfers also highlight the rising importance of private equity firms, hedge funds, and other giant asset-management firms as they push deeper into the world of private credit. A trader works at the post where New York Community Bancorp stock is traded on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe CRTs are structured like insurance policies: A bank issues credit-linked notes to an outside investor that amount to a portion of that lender\u2019s loan portfolio \u2014 in exchange for cash.\n\nThe big benefit to the bank is that it is protected against future losses and no longer has to hold capital against the assets. The benefit to the investor is that it collects regular interest payments from the bank.\n\n\u201cIt's banks buying an insurance policy on a basket of loans,\u201d Josh Siegel, CEO of StoneCastle Partners, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe cost of these deals for banks rises depending on the riskiness of the loans, and thus most banks are choosing to seek insurance against some of their better assets.\n\nThat also helps explain why these deals are so attractive to private equity, hedge funds, and asset management firms, including BlackRock (BLK), Blackstone (BX), Apollo (APO), Ares (ARES), and KKR (KKR).\n\n\"We've been doing this with a variety of banks who are highly creditworthy,\" Blackstone COO Jon Gray told analysts during a recent earnings call.\n\nIt helps banks with their regulatory and balance sheet pressures, \"and we\u2019re able to generate favorable returns,\" he added, calling the arrangement \"a win-win.\"\n\nThese deals \u2014 which also are known as synthetic risk transfers or capital relief trades \u2014 have been around for a while, especially in Europe, where banks have grown accustomed to aggressive capital requirements from their regulators. The Blackstone Group headquarters in New York City. (REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nLast year investors put up roughly $25 billion in capital across $300 billion of bank loan portfolios worldwide, a 25% increase from 2022, according to Structured Credit Investor. The bulk of those trades occurred in Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey have been less common in the US until now, beyond some government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, which turned to these deals following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\n\nBut the demand for them is on the rise in the US as regulators prepare a new set of regulations known as the \"Basel 3 endgame,\" which will likely require banks to hold even more capital to provide greater buffers against future losses.\n\nRegulators are trying to finalize those rules this year following pushback from banks.\n\nThe volume of these credit risk transfers is expected to grow by 20% this year, according to Mark Fontanilla, a fixed-income strategist who has created an index measuring the transactions.\n\n\"We are seeing this trend spread from Europe to the US,\" KKR co-CEO Scott Nuttall said during the firm\u2019s recent earnings call.\n\n'We need to approach it with great caution'\n\nSome of the recent deals in the US ranged from small banks to some of the biggest in the country.\n\nMerchants Bank of Indiana issued $158 million in credit-linked notes on $1.1 billion of nursing and senior housing loans, and regional banks US Bancorp (USB) and Huntington (HBAN) each transferred hundreds of millions of dollars worth of risk on auto loans.\n\nHuntington \u2014 which is based in Columbus, Ohio \u2014 said the transaction cost an estimated $23 million in fees and other expenses and freed up about $2.4 billion in capital.\n\nSome industry giants have also taken advantage. Morgan Stanley (MS) purchased $250 million worth of protection on some of its loans, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has issued credit-linked notes on its auto loans since 2021.\n\nWells Fargo (WFC) is also weighing such a deal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRegulators thus far don\u2019t sound overly concerned about these arrangements. The Fed last year broadened the criteria for how banks can use credit-linked notes to mitigate risk. Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael Hsu, testifies on Capitol Hill last year. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMonths later, its top banking regulator, Michael Barr, told Congress, \"We have approved them on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"We're going to wait and see how those instruments perform,\" said Barr, the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision. \"If they perform as intended, then they might be more generally available,\" he added.\n\nDuring that same hearing, other regulators offered some caution.\n\n\"I think there is considerable uncertainty and we need to approach it with great caution and attention,\" said FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg.\n\nActing Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu agreed, saying, \"They do require heightened attention, especially when risk transfer is thought of as risk elimination, which it is not.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve never heard of a regulator complaining,\" Siegel of StoneCastle Partners told Yahoo Finance. \"They know it's a bit of a game but it's a game they know is legal because they wrote the rules.\"\n\nThere are still industry observers who say these deals show some resemblance to the credit default swaps that created so many problems during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"It gives us shivers,\" said banking analyst Glenn Schorr during a recent Blackstone earnings call. \"It reminds us about 16 years ago.\"\n\nWarren Kornfeld, a senior vice president for Moody\u2019s Ratings who monitors these deals, said \"there are similarities\" but \"the difference, hopefully, is the risk of the underlying asset.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Morgan Stanley (MS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMorgan Stanley's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Morgan Stanley's main business drivers.\n\nFounded in 1935 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1981, Morgan Stanley is the leading financial services holding company headquartered in New York. With 79,610 employees, the company serves a diversified group of clients and customers \u2014 including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals \u2014 through offices across 41 countries.\n\nThe company\u2019s business is divided into three segments:\n\nThe Institutional Securities (\"IS\") segment (contributing 42.6% of total net revenues in 2023) includes capital raising; financial advisory services that include advices on mergers and acquisitions (M&As), restructurings, real estate and project finance; corporate lending; sales, trading, financing and market-making activities in equity and fixed income securities and related products, including foreign exchange and commodities; benchmark indices and risk management analytics; and investment activities.\r\n\r\nThe Wealth Management (\"WM\") segment (48.5%) provides brokerage and investment advisory services covering various investment alternatives; financial and wealth planning services; annuity and other insurance products; credit and other lending products; cash management services; retirement services; and trust and fiduciary services and engages in fixed income principal trading.\r\n\r\nThe Investment Management (\"IM\") segment (8.9%) provides global asset management products and services in equity, fixed income, alternative investments that include hedge funds and funds of funds, and merchant banking including real estate, private equity and infrastructure, to institutional and retail clients through proprietary and third-party distribution channels. The segment also engages in investment.\n\nIn 2019, Morgan Stanley acquired Canada-based Solium Capital Inc. and renamed it as Shareworks by Morgan Stanley. In 2020, the company acquired E*Trade Financial. In 2021, it acquired Eaton Vance.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Morgan Stanley ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $3,305.59, or a gain of 230.56%, as of May 10, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.57% and the price of gold increased 74.82% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for MS.\n\nMorgan Stanley's new strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ will bolster its presence in Japan and support footprint diversification efforts. Also, initiatives to become less dependent on capital-markets-driven revenue sources, inorganic expansion efforts and high rates will likely aid the top line. Per our estimates, total revenues are expected to witness a CAGR of 4.1% by 2026. Yet, rising costs is likely to hamper profitability. We project total non-interest expenses to record a CAGR of 2.3% by 2026. Its shares have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The ambiguity of the performance of the capital markets is a major woe and will likely hurt the Institutional Securities segment\u2019s prospects. However, resurgence of investment banking (IB) business and the company\u2019s solid pipeline in the business will aid financials.\n\nThe stock is up 12.98% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 8 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve disclosed results from an assessment of how big US banks would be impacted by climate change, an exercise that created new political tensions for the central bank.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) found that 20-50% of their commercial and residential real estate loans in the Northeast would be impacted by the most severe climate shock\u2014 defined as having no insurance coverage for a once-in-200-year event under events including hurricanes, flooding and wildfires.\n\nThe impact would be a change in the estimated probability of default on those loans.\n\nThe banks were tasked with determining how heatwaves, wildfires, higher average temperatures, a hurricane in the Northeast and another hazard of their choosing would affect their residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Pedestrians approach JPMorgan Chase headquarters, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut they had a difficult time trying to model climate risks to assess the impact on loan portfolios, noting significant challenges gathering data and measuring climate-related risks.\n\nThe goal was for the Fed to better understand banks' risk-management approaches to this issue so it can manage the risks climate poses to the wider financial system.\n\nThe climate analysis was exploratory and did not come with any penalties for banks, unlike a separate annual stress test run by the Fed designed to determine whether banks can withstand severe economic shocks.\n\nYet the act of the test itself created new political complications for the central bank and Chairman Jay Powell, who has gone out of his way in public speeches to make it clear the Fed would avoid making climate policy.\n\n\"Policies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies that they have charged with this responsibility\" he said during a speech last month at Stanford University. \"The Fed has received no such charge.\" Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell speaks at Stanford University last month. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\n\"We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,\" he said during his speech, pledging to avoid \"mission creep.\"\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped lawmakers and other policy makers from criticizing Powell on this subject.\n\nHis remarks on climate came roughly two weeks after Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse sent a letter to Powell arguing the Fed\u2019s high interest rates were delaying clean energy developments.\n\nSen. Whitehouse told Yahoo Finance last month that other central banks around the world closely consider climate change because \"if left unchecked climate change will pose 'systemic risks' to our financial system and the broader economy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Republicans have also repeatedly come down on Powell for considering rules that would test banks' ability to withstand climate-related scenarios, arguing it falls out of the scope of the Fed's authority.\n\nNot everyone within the Fed agrees with the approach, either.\n\nLast May, Fed Governor Chris Waller said he doesn\u2019t believe climate change poses a serious risk to the US financial system even as the central bank tested the resilience of banks under different climate scenarios. Fed governor Christopher Waller. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) (Sarah Silbiger via Getty Images)\n\n\"Climate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States,\" Waller said in a speech in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\"I don't see a need for special treatment for climate-related risks in our financial stability monitoring and policies,\" he added.\n\nBut Powell maintains that the central bank has a narrow role that relates to supervising banks.\n\n\"The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will understand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which, over time, are likely to include climate-related financial risks,\" Powell said on April 3.\n\n\"We will remain alert to the risk that there will be pressure to expand that role over time.\"\n\nBanks used different approaches to develop the physical and transition risk scenarios required by the Fed and to translate these scenarios into climate-adjusted credit risk parameters.\n\nThey also noted the need to monitor changes across the insurance industry, including changes in insurance costs over time, and the impacts of those changes on consumers and businesses in specific markets and segments.\n\nBank\u2019s estimates of climate-adjusted credit risk parameters, such as probability of default, showed significant differences in impact across sectors, regions, and counterparties.\n\nThe exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences.\n\nDrawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Fed said it will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

The decrease in operating expenses quarter over quarter was attributable to lower interest and other financing expenses and lower incentive fees due to the partial incentive fee waiver for one year after the Company\u2019s IPO and partially offset by higher management fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet investment income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $54.7 million, or $0.63 per share, compared to $55.5 million, or $0.67 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, net change in unrealized appreciation on investments was $2.7 million offset by realized losses of $5.6 million.\n\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company\u2019s investment portfolio had a fair value of approximately $3.3 billion, comprised of 178 portfolio companies across 31 industries, with an average investment size of $18.5 million, or 0.6% of our total portfolio on a fair value basis.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 largest banks in the US by customers. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Largest Banks in the US by Customers.\n\nBanking Industry in the US: An Overview\n\nThe failure of prominent US banks including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), First Republic Bank (FRB), and Signature Bank (SBNY) has resulted in a continued increase in the short interest rate across the country. According to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence data, short loan value in terms of percentage of market capitalization went from 0.29% to 0.46% between January 1st, 2022 and March 10th, 2023.\n\nOne of the primary forces driving the banking industry through such unfavorable circumstances is the increase in the adoption of digital banking. Estimates by the Bank Administrative Institute Banking Outlook: 2024 Trends show that by 2026, bank customers will likely use online banking and other digital channels for 65% of their financial transactions. Furthermore, data from the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households revealed that more than 43% of consumers considered digital banking their primary route for financial transactions in 2021. With customers flocking to flexible and easily accessible digital channels for their financial needs, more and more financial institutions are embracing digital platforms. This increase in adoption has resulted in a snowball effect on market growth.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve's report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households 2022 revealed that 6% of families are unbanked, while 13% adults used money orders or nonbank check chasing, down by 3% from 2019. Moreover, 11% of adults with a bank account paid an overdraft fee in the prior 12 months. This number remained unchanged from 2021. You can also look at 25 Largest Banks in the World by Assets.\n\nEffects on Bank Account Ownership due to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new age of digital banking adoption, but it also affected the status of bank account ownership across the globe. The FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households inquired people about possible changes in their economic condition since the spread of the pandemic in March 2020, and to what extent such changes affected the opening or closing of their bank accounts. According to data collected by the survey, around 34.9% people opened a bank account since March 2020, primarily because they received a government benefit payment. Such benefit payments include pandemic stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, and others. On the other hand, around 21.2% of unbanked households, which comes up to about one in five people, closed a bank account since March 2020 because of reduced working hours, loss of a job, being furloughed, or experiencing a significant income loss. The number of people using banks across the United States thus experienced significant ups and downs due to the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players in the Banking Industry\n\nThe top 5 banks in the United States control 41.2% of the domestic market in terms of assets. According to data from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, these top 5 banks in descending order of their consolidated assets are JPMorgan Chase & Co.

On March 6, Reuters reported that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) made a new record by securing 644 patents across the United States in 2023. These numbers increased by 13% between 2022 and 2023, primarily because of its increased focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and information security. Aditya Bhasin, BofA's Chief Technology and Information Officer, said that:\n\n\"Innovation is everybody's business - this is not a lab or some small group tucked away. We are thinking about how AI can be used to make us able to serve our clients better.\"\n\nErica, the virtual assistant for The Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), also uses patented technology to boost customer experience. It alerts customers about their spending habits, and also sends out reminders of recurring transactions.\n\nWells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) is the third most prominent player in the banking industry.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 largest banks in the US by asset size in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Largest Banks in the US by Asset Size in 2024.\n\nOverview of the Banking Sector in the US\n\nAccording to the latest data by the Federal Reserve System, the total assets for large domestically chartered commercial banks stood at $13.48 trillion as of April 10, 2024. The total assets for small domestically chartered banks were $6.64 trillion as of the same date. Assets of the large commercial banks between January 2015 and March 2023 increased from $9.1 trillion to $13.2 trillion. This translates to an asset increase of around 44.8%. Assets of small commercial banks increased from $3.6 trillion to $7 trillion in the same period, reporting a 94.5% increase. The report also shows a 22.7% increase in the assets of foreign-related institutions active in the United States between January 2015 and March 2023. Their total assets went from $2.5 trillion in 2015 to $3.1 trillion in 2023.\n\nHowever, the ratio of the total assets of large banks in comparison with small banks was 2.56. It dropped to 1.90 by March, 2023. These recent trends show a shift of assets from the 25 largest commercial banks in the United States to the smaller banks. March 2023 sent ripples of a banking turmoil throughout the US and global banking sector, with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsing. The First Republic Bank (FRB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) followed SVB's lead, making the failure the biggest bank collapse after Washington Mutual Bank's ordeal in 2008.\u00a0Silicon Valley Bank ranked at the 16th position before its failure on March 10, 2023. It had assets worth $194.51 billion at the time. Similarly, Signature Bank ranked as the 29th largest bank in the United States by assets before it failed on March 12, 2024. The bank had total assets worth $110.36 billion. You can also look at 25 Largest Banks in the World by Assets.\n\nKey Players in the Banking Sector\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM),\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) rank among some of the largest banks in the world, and the United States. As of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) had total assets worth $3.89 trillion, making it the largest bank in the United States by asset size. As of March 31, 2023, the bank had $303 billion in stockholders\u2019 equity. On April 12, 2024, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported financial results for the first quarter of FY 2024. The bank reported a revenue of $42.5 billion. Its net income reached $14.0 billion, and reduced to $13.4 billion after excluding the increase of $725 million to the FDIC special assessment. Here is what Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), had to say:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe reported strong results in the first quarter, delivering net income of $13.4 billion, or $14.0 billion excluding a $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment. Last month, we announced a 10% increase in the common dividend. Our exceptionally high CET1 capital ratio of 15.0% and peer-leading returns provide us with the capacity and flexibility to both reinvest for growth and maintain an attractive capital-return profile, without compromising our fortress balance sheet.\n\nThis quarter, NII declined 4% sequentially, and as expected, NII ex. Markets declined 2% sequentially due to deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances, mostly in CCB. Looking ahead, we expect normalization to continue for both NII and credit costs.\n\nOur lines of business saw strong underlying performance. In CCB, client investment assets were up 25% excluding First Republic, and we continued to add new customers. In CIB, IB fees increased 21%, reflecting improved DCM and ECM activity. In CB, we saw strong growth in Payments fees and onboarded a significant number of new client relationships. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees were up 14%, with continued strong net inflows.\u201d\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported total assets worth 3.15 trillion as of December 31, 2023. On April 16, the company reported its financial earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The bank reported a net income of $6.7 billion, which comes up to $0.76 per diluted share. This included FDIC\u2019s special assessment expense accrual to compensate for the losses of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank failures. It reported a net income of $7.2 billion excluding this expense. Here are some comments from Bank of America Corporation's (NYSE:BAC) Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.5 billion in shares, which more than offset our employee awards. As part of those share awards in the first quarter, we announced our seventh consecutive year of share and success compensation awards, covering more than 95% of our associates and further aligning their interests with shareholders. Tangible book value per share of $24.79 is up 9% year-over-year. Looking at regulatory capital, our CET-1 level improved to $197 billion from December 31, and the CET-1 ratio was stable at 11.8% and remained well above our current 10% requirement. We also remain quite well positioned against the current proposed capital rules as our CET-1 level is also above the 10% requirement even when we include estimated RWA inflation from those new proposed rules.\"\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is another key player in the banking sector. It reported $1.90 trillion in total assets as of December 31, 2023, making it one of the largest bank in the United States by asset size. On April 12, 2024,\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) also reported its earnings for the first quarter of 2024. It reported a net income of $4.6 billion, which comes up to $1.02 per diluted share. The bank also announced a total revenue of $20.863 billion in Q1 of FY2024, up from $20.729 billion in Q1 of FY2023. Here are some comments from Wells Fargo & Company's (NYSE:WFC) Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"We continue to see strength in the US economy. Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year-over-year. Consumer credit is performing as we expect. Wholesale credit continues to perform well and our views around commercial real estate have not significantly changed since last quarter. These are all positives. In addition, we remain committed and confident in our ability to increase efficiencies across the enterprise and areas we have targeted for investments such as credit card, investment banking and trading are performing well. We are beginning to see early signs of share and fee growth, which will be important as we diversify our revenues and reduce net interest income as a percentage of revenue.\"\n\nNow that we have looked at the banking sector of the United States, let us look at the 20 largest banks in the US by asset size in 2024.

        "content": "(Adds details and context from report throughout and background)\n\nMay 9 (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended on Thursday that Morgan Stanley shareholders vote against the management's proposal to ratify former CEO James Gorman's pay.\n\nGorman stepped down as the CEO of the investment bank at beginning of the year after holding the top job for more than a decade.\n\nISS said voting against the recommendation was warranted \"in light of significant concerns surrounding one-time awards granted to three named-executive officers in connection with the CEO transition\".\n\n\"This overlapping approach results in a sizable supplemental pay opportunity for the same performance outcomes. Additionally, a significant portion of the award lacks performance criteria,\" it added.\n\nMorgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nIn October, Morgan Stanley gave its newly appointed CEO Ted Pick and the two other executives \u2014 Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz \u2014 that were considered for the top job one-time bonuses of $20 million each.\n\nThe performance-linked stock awards were based on fair value calculations of the bank's stock price at the time. The bonuses vest in 2027.\n\nThe proxy adviser said Gorman's proposed pay of roughly $32.9 million in 2023 was above the CEO peer median of about $26.8 million.

        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nBased in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 2.72%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.85 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.55% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.44% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.58%.\n\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 29.33%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nMS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.84 per share, with earnings expected to increase 25.27% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that MS is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised Apple\u2019s target price post-earnings, noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let\u2019s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company\u2019s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.\n\nApart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon\u2019s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization. And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon\u2019s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.\n\nAs a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.\n\nStory continues\n\niShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) iShares by Blackrock sign\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500\u2019s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index\u2019s total return.\n\nTherefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) stands out as a compelling choice. This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.\n\nSince its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.\n\nAmong its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).\n\nIYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW\u2019s expense ratio of 0.4%.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.\n\nRecently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year\u2019s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.\n\nInvestors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company\u2019s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm\u2019s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.\n\nSo far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts\u2019 price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in META stock.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley CIO Cites 'Humbling Business' Behind Wrong Forecasts, Gives Up Predicting S&P 500 As One Division Faces SEC Probe\n\nSimilar to how Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) stock lately has underperformed many of its banking peers, its Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson has significantly underperformed other market prognosticators.\n\nWilson has gotten so many market forecasts wrong over the past few years that he's effectively given up even trying to predict their future movements.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here\u2019s how anyone can invest for a limited time. Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women\u2019s health problem at 80 cents per share.\n\nAfter successfully calling for the 2022 market selloff during market euphoria in September 2021, Wilson announced he would no longer make index-level calls, attributing his mistakes as being in \"a humbling business\" and that he now spends more time looking at specific companies.\n\nPopular financial X user Barchart mocked Wilson's failed market forecasts, recently posting \"after being wrong about everything over the last 18 months, Wilson has decided to no longer make bold predictions about the S&P 500.\"\n\nWhile he retains his CIO position, Morgan Stanley said in an internal memo in February that Wilson would be leaving the firm's Global Investment Committee.Chief Operating Officer Jed Finn said Wilson would \"focus on serving his key institutional clients, where the demand for generating tactical alpha is intensifying.\"\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Wealth Management division has recently brought negative attention to the firm. It is the target of a multiagency probe that includes the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other Treasury Department offices.\n\nThe investigation stems from concerns that Morgan Stantley's know your client (KYC) procedures may be inadequate. Wilson was hired as CIO of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division in 2012.\n\nWhile some investors and traders can be keen to follow Wall Street's short-term predictions, it may be worth remembering the famous quote by Fisher Investments Chairman Kenneth Fisher, who said, \"Time in the market beats timing the market.\"\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index, is up about 72% over the past five years and over 1,000% since 1993.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nFortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for investors in the upcoming series.

It will use $2.59 billion of that amount to reprice its existing existing obligation to 275 to 300 basis points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate while keeping the price at par, based on initial discussions, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\n\nIts current loan has a margin of 325 basis points over the benchmark.\n\nMeanwhile, an incremental $140 million loan, which will be used to redeem preferred equity, is being discussed at the same margin as the portion that\u2019s being repriced, but with a discounted price of 99.5 to 99.75 cents on the dollar, the people said.\n\nMorgan Stanley is leading the transaction and a lender call was held on Monday at 11 a.m. New York time, the people said.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley MS is well-positioned for growth on the back of strategic expansion efforts and a solid balance sheet. A favorable macroeconomic backdrop is expected to revive its investment banking (IB) business, thereby further strengthening the company\u2019s financials.\r\n\r\nAnalysts are also optimistic about the stock\u2019s earnings growth potential. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for both 2024 and 2025 has moved 1% and 1.2% north, respectively. MS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nOver the past three months, shares of Morgan Stanley have rallied 24%, underperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 32.1%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into the reasons that make MS stock a lucrative bet now.\r\n\r\nEarnings Growth: Morgan Stanley witnessed earnings growth of 4.7% over the past three to five years, driven by decent top-line growth and strategic buyouts.\r\n \r\nWith the operating backdrop turning favorable for the investment banking segment, growth in wealth management and investment management segments and strategic expansion, the company\u2019s earnings are expected to continue the upward momentum. Hence, we expect earnings to grow at the rate of 23.6%, 11.2% and 4.1% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\r\n\r\nRevenue Strength: Morgan Stanley remains focused on its revenue growth. The company\u2019s net revenues witnessed a CAGR of 6.2% in the last five years (2018-2023), primarily attributable to growth in investment management and wealth management segments as the company lowers its reliance on capital markets-driven revenues. This also helped it mitigate volatility in the top line.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the recent rebound in the IB business after two years of subdued performance is expected to support Morgan Stanley\u2019s revenues going forward. The demand for both advisory and underwriting businesses will likely tick up as corporates realize that higher interest rates are here to stay for a longer period.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for total net revenues implies 6.3%, 4.2% and 2% growth in 2024, 2025 and 2026 revenues, respectively.\r\n\r\nStrategic Expansion Efforts: MS has undertaken strategic expansion initiatives over the past few years, driven by its strong liquidity and balance sheet position. This has also helped the company expand internationally, mainly in Europe and Canada.\r\n\r\nIn July 2023, Morgan Stanley announced plans to merge its certain operations with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) to further expand its presence in Japan. This MUFG deal aims to combine Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients with underwriting business to be rearranged between two brokerage units. Besides that, the opportunistic buyouts of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks poise Morgan Stanley well for future growth.\r\n\r\nStrong Balance Sheet: As of Mar 31, 2024, Morgan Stanley had a long-term debt of $266.2 billion, with roughly $19.7 billion set to mature over the upcoming 12 months. Further, the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were $102.3 billion. Given the investment-grade ratings and stable outlook from rating agencies, along with solid earnings strength, the company will be able to meet its debt obligations even if the economic situation worsens.\r\n\r\nSteady Capital Distributions: Morgan Stanley\u2019s capital distribution activities remain encouraging. Following the 2023 stress test results, the company hiked its dividend by 10% to 85 cents per share in July. Concurrently, the company re-authorized the repurchase of shares worth up to $20 billion, effective in third-quarter 2023. As of Mar 31, 2024, $16.2 billion remained under the buyback authorization.\r\n\r\nGiven a robust capital and liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is expected to continue efficient capital distributions, thus enhancing shareholder value.\r\n\r\nStock Seems Undervalued: Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock seems undervalued as its price-to-earnings (F1) and price-to-book ratios of 13.69 and 1.68, respectively, are well below industry averages of 17.28 and 2.39.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nA couple of other stocks from the financial services space worth a look are Interactive Brokers IBKR and Stifel Financial SF.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interactive Brokers\u2019 current-year earnings has been revised 4.9% north over the past 30 days.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Asia. We have also discussed the economic development taking place in Asia in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia.\n\nEconomic Development in Asia in 2024\n\nAccording to the Asian Development Bank, Developing Asia is forecasted to grow by 4.9% in 2024 and maintain the same rate in 2025, driven by factors like the end of interest rate hikes and a recovery in goods exports, especially in semiconductor demand. India is leading in the investment-driven growth, positioning itself as a major economic engine in the region.\n\nMoreover, inflation in developing Asia is projected to be 3.2% in 2024, slightly decreasing to 3.0% in 2025. Subregionally, South Asia is leading in growth, with forecasts of 6.3% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025. India's growth is anticipated to remain strong at 7.0% in fiscal year 2024, supported by rising consumption and investment. Bangladesh expects growth driven by garment exports, while Bhutan sees growth due to hydropower investment. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are set to recover from previous contractions, though challenges like inflation persist.\n\nSoutheast Asia forecasts growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025, with Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Malaysia driving growth through strong domestic demand and recovering exports. Meanwhile, the Pacific expects a slight decline in 2024 before picking up in 2025, with Papua New Guinea leading growth due to increased mining activity.\n\nState of Jobs in South Asia\n\nWhile the economic development looks promising, it is worth highlighting that in South Asia, job creation has struggled to keep up with the rapid expansion of the working-age population, according to a report by the World Bank. Over the period from 2000 to 2023, employment grew at a rate of 1.7% annually, while the working-age population increased by 1.9% each year. This imbalance led to a situation where the region was only able to generate an average of 10 million jobs annually, despite a working-age population growth of 19 million per year.\n\nIndia, the largest economy in South Asia, has experienced major challenges in job creation despite strong economic growth. The country's employment ratio declined over the same period, except for a partial rebound in 2023. While India's economy is expected to expand at a rate of 6.6% with the potential for even stronger growth, private investment remains weak.\n\nSpeaking of jobs, finance specialists and information technology specialists are two of the highest paying jobs in Asia. To read more about highest payings jobs, see the Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $100 an Hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nOwing to the economic potential of Asia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is currently involved in several contributions to Asia, particularly in Malaysia, with a landmark investment of $2.2 billion over the next four years. It is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s largest commitment in its 32-year history in Malaysia and is essentially focused on several key areas such as building digital infrastructure and creating AI skilling opportunities.\n\nThe investment will also entail building cloud and AI infrastructure in Malaysia, which will not only meet the growing demand for cloud computing services but also enable the country to capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by AI technology. Additionally, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) aims to provide AI skilling opportunities for an additional 200,000 people in Malaysia and hence, contribute to the development of a skilled workforce prepared for the AI era. Furthermore, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is strengthening its partnership with the Government of Malaysia to establish a national AI Centre of Excellence and enhance the country\u2019s cybersecurity capabilities. While Asia has been a hot destination for investments by several multinational companies, it is not immune to global lay offs.\n\nLay Offs in Asia in 2024\n\nFor example, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) plans to slash around 50 investment banking jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority concentrated in Hong Kong and China. These cuts will affect roughly 13% of the regional banking workforce and highlight the severity of the challenges facing the industry.\n\nMoreover, during the final phase of a comprehensive global restructuring, Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) has executed layoffs in its equities research division in Asia Pacific. At least 10 employees were affected by this recent action. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C)\u2019s restructuring efforts have seen a reduction in management layers from 13 to 8 with an aim to optimize efficiency. This latest round of layoffs aligns with the bank's target of reducing its global workforce by 20,000 over the next two years, as stated by CEO Jane Fraser. The bank previously announced plans to eliminate 1,500 managerial roles, constituting 13% of its leadership globally, with estimated annual savings of $1 billion. However, the repercussions extend beyond the equities research department, as Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) plans to continue downsizing across all divisions in the Asia-Pacific region, including investment banking. 15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia\n\nraimond-klavins-JqT2Wp5S0Dk-unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the countries with the highest average salaries in Asia, we looked at the 48 Asian countries in the world and their average salaries.

        "content": "Soft economic landing achieved, says one of the most influential voices in the markets.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve had a soft landing,\u201d Apollo Global Management (APO) CEO Marc Rowan told Yahoo Finance Live at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday. \u201cWill it continue? I think so.\u201d\n\nA soft landing for the economy is loosely defined as growth continuing \u2014 and recession averted \u2014 amid a series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nAlthough markets have had mixed response to economic as data of late, with investors debating the outlook for interest rates, the raw numbers underscore Rowan's views.\n\nThe US economy expanded by 1.6% in the first quarter, the slowest pace in nearly two years \u2014 but it's still growing instead of contracting. The economy advanced by a 3.4% annualized rate in the final quarter of 2024.\n\nGDP growth for 2023 tallied a 2.5% annualized pace, defying calls for a mild recession at the start of the year by several Wall Street firms.\n\n\"When rates have gone up 400 basis points and the wheels haven't come off the bus, as they say I think that's the definition of a soft landing,\" Rowan added.\n\nSigns of a healthye economy showed up in Apollo's first quarter earnings.\n\nTotal assets under management (AUM) rose 12% year over year to $671 billion, benefiting from $40 billion in inflows.\n\nThe company saw record quarterly debt origination volume of $40 billion.\n\nAsset management fees in the asset management segment rose 13%, driven by demand for retirement services.\n\nApollo shares are up 22% year to date, out-performing the S&P 500's 9% gain.\n\nApollo Global Management is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we'll look into Morgan Stanley's top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Morgan Stanley's\u00a0Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nWith the upcoming U.S. election season looming, the Federal Reserve has attempted to chart a course of interest rate cuts, banking on the assumption that inflation will eventually be reined in. However, despite this, both economic growth and the labor market have displayed resilience. Recent economic indicators have prompted Morgan Stanley Research to revise its forecast for U.S. economic growth, now projecting 2.3% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Consequently, the Fed is expected to initiate the first rate cut of this cycle in July, instead of the previously anticipated June, followed by two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end. Looking ahead to 2025, Morgan Stanley anticipates a continued downward trend in rates, with the Fed making cuts at each meeting through June, aiming to reach a rate of 3.625%.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 marked Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick's inaugural term, with his background in investment banking and trading standing in contrast to his predecessor James Gorman's focus on wealth management. Pick's tenure began on a challenging note, with the bank facing headwinds from high-interest rates prompting wealth management clients to shift funds into higher-yielding securities. By April 16, the bank's shares had declined by nearly 7% for the year. However, similar to its competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley benefitted from robust trading and investment banking performance in Q1. Pick, emphasizing the vital role of dealmaking as an \"existential reality\" for companies, signaled a potential catalyst for Wall Street's awaited recovery in investment banking. While Morgan Stanley's resurgence in investment banking trailed some of its competitors\u2014Goldman Sachs saw a 32% increase in fees\u2014Pick remained optimistic.\n\n\"I\u2019m feeling good about this being early-to-mid cycle for the classic investment banking, capital markets business around the world,\" said Pick, who succeeded long-serving chief James Gorman in January.\n\nSee also: Goldman Sachs\u2019 Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nThe results underscored the prowess of Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm, which has been pivotal in driving the bank's growth in recent years, particularly evident in its ability to attract significant new client assets. This led to the bank's first-quarter profits surging by 14% year-over-year to $3.41 billion, or $2.02 per share, with each of its three main divisions contributing to the growth, while revenue increased by 4% to $15.14 billion. Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% to $6.88 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million, driven by market gains boosting fee revenue despite a decrease in interest income. At the same time, fixed-income trading revenue dipped by 3.5% to $2.49 billion but still beat expectations by $120 million. Investment banking revenue surged by 16% to $1.45 billion, slightly surpassing the $1.40 billion estimate, driven by higher debt and equity issuance, offsetting lower acquisition fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking more on its outlook for the future, this is what the bank's management had to say during the first quarter 2024 earnings call:\n\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels.\n\nWe continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time.

The GAAP EPS stood at \u00a5294.82, with revenue reaching \u00a53747.5 billion, marking a significant 21.7% year-over-year increase.\n\nInsider Monkey's database, tracking 933 elite hedge funds, revealed that the number of hedge funds investing in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) remained unchanged in Q4 compared to Q3, with 21 hedge funds.

The company has been on a roller coast since the approval of Aduhelm, for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in June 2021. At the time, the approval was highly criticized given the limited efficacy of the treatment. Following the fallout, the company stands today with a new highly regarded CEO, Christopher Viehbacher, a more efficacious approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatment in Leqembi, a rationalized cost structure and a more disciplined investment approach. While the uptake in Leqembi has been slow, we still see strong long-term potential for a patient population that is dramatically underserved. We believe you are getting the opportunity to buy a high performing health care asset, with a strong track record of delivering superior products all while only paying for the current value of their assets on the market today. At the current valuation, we think you are getting a call option on the pipeline and the Leqembi roll-out.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy That Morgan Stanley Is Loving Right Now",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a big name on Wall Street, and many of its analysts are truly at the top of their game. While I wouldn\u2019t blindly follow Morgan Stanley analysts, I do think they\u2019re worth listening to whenever they update their notes or ratings.\n\nFor the most part, Morgan Stanley is quite bullish on many of the market\u2019s darlings, especially in the mega-cap scene. Amid the market\u2019s latest upswing, they\u2019ve been proven right to stay bullish, even as some of the bears out there have expressed their doubts that the latest market run can continue.\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll check in with three stocks spanning a wide range of industries that MS is quite upbeat about right now. With impressive price targets and overweight (or buy) ratings, the following plays may make for great Morgan Stanley stock picks in May 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdidas (ADDYY) DONOTUSE\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMorgan Stanley recently gave European apparel play Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) a big vote of confidence with a \u201cdouble upgrade\u201d to Overweight from Underweight, skipping the Neutral (or Hold) rating. Indeed, such double upgrades are quite rare, but they may suggest a potentially drastic change of the tides.\n\nMost notably, analysts at Morgan Stanley think \u201clifestyle momentum has legs\u201d as the \u201cfashion pendulum\u201d swings from \u201cchunkier basketball shoes to so-called terrace shoes.\u201d The analysts also pointed to specific pieces of footwear in the Adidas line that could do well from here, specifically Samba, Gazelle and Spezial.\n\nAs fashion trends shift in time for summer 2024, perhaps Adidas classics will be in higher demand compared to Jordans, high-tech runners and those \u201cdad shoes\u201d with large midsoles.\n\nI think Morgan Stanley is right to praise Adidas as it continues its comeback from its late-2022 depths. Since hitting that bottom, the stock has soared more than 140%, an impressive showing that tells us it\u2019s ready to thrive in the post-Yeezy era.\n\nSeagate Technology (STX) A Seagate Technology (STX) sign hanging above an office in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData storage firm Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) also won a nice upgrade from Morgan Stanley analysts in recent weeks. Led by big-name analyst Erik Woodring, the bank hiked STX stock to Overweight from Equal-Weight alongside a price target raised to $115.00 per share.\n\nWhat\u2019s the reason for the upgrade? Analysts see an opportunity to expand margins through numerous means. From \u201cbetter pricing\u201d to \u201cbuild-to-order dynamics,\u201d Seagate certainly has many levers it can pull to enhance profitability. Additionally, Morgan Stanley sees Seagate as a beneficiary of the generative AI boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, the AI rush will likely see increased uptake for data storage hardware in addition to GPUs. In that regard, STX stock may very well be a stealthy way to play the AI uprising.\n\nMore recently, Seagate disappointed some when it noted delays in meeting orders for its innovative heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) drives. The HAMR technology allows for greater areal density and seems to represent one of the latest breakthroughs in data storage solutions. In my view, a small delay won\u2019t change demand for such a game-changing product. If anything, it\u2019s likely to build up.\n\nNetflix (NFLX)\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock may have stumbled past its latest round of quarterly results. But Morgan Stanley is maintaining its bullish stance and $700 price target, which entails more than 23% in upside from Thursday\u2019s close of around $565 per share.\n\nThough NFLX stock has become a heck of a lot more expensive after another year of solid gains, the company has continued to demonstrate its dominance in the mature market of streaming.

        "content": "LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British retail tycoon Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has withdrawn its London lawsuit against Morgan Stanley over a nearly $1 billion margin call, a spokesperson for the Wall Street bank said on Friday.\n\nFrasers had sued Morgan Stanley for about 47 million euros ($50.5 million) after the bank imposed the margin call \u2013 security to cover possible losses \u2013 on the retailer's trading position in German fashion group Hugo Boss in May 2021.\n\nAshley, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be worth $5.1 billion, gave evidence at the trial at London's High Court in February that the demand for collateral left him in \"total shock\".\n\nFrasers has dropped its lawsuit before the court gave its ruling, Morgan Stanley said on Friday.\n\n\"Frasers Group plc and Mr Michael Ashley have both withdrawn their claims against Morgan Stanley on terms which do not involve any payment of monies by any party to any other,\" a spokesperson for the bank said in a statement.\n\n\"Frasers, Mr Ashley and Morgan Stanley confirm that the disputes between them are therefore resolved.\"\n\nFrasers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company's lawyers had argued the bank changed the purpose of its $915 million margin call after discovering Frasers stood behind trades held by its client, Saxo Bank.\n\nFrasers alleged Morgan Stanley's staff saw Ashley as an \"upstart\" and used the margin call to force trades held by off its books partly out of snobbery.\n\nMorgan Stanley, however, said it had no contractual relationship with Frasers, only with Saxo, and argued the margin call was designed to ensure it was properly protected from exposure to stock market bets.\n\nThe margin call came two months after the collapse of family office Archegos Capital, in which Morgan Stanley lost $911 million.\n\nSaxo and Frasers had settled their case separately before the trial.

        "content": "Within a few weeks of the earnings season,\u00a0financial institutions and tech companies beat expectations and report impressive numbers. Fintech\u2019s potential is enormous, and the transition toward digital payments has made the industry hot property. Several financial companies have reported impressive quarterly results, and financial stocks to buy are soaring. But this doesn\u2019t mean\u00a0you\u00a0have missed the bus.\n\nIf there is a stock plunge, do not wait longer and pounce on it. These three financial stocks are the best in the industry, will earn you steady income through dividends, and\u00a0will continue\u00a0to report impressive results as the economy improves. The long-term potential of these three stocks is attractive. With that in mind, let\u2019s\u00a0look at the three financial stocks to buy whenever there is a dip.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 5% year-to-date, Visa (NYSE:V) stock is trading at $271 today and was on an upward spree until March but has recently pulled back. One of the best financial stocks to buy, Visa is a global brand that caters to\u00a0over\u00a0100 million merchants. With over 4 billion cards in circulation worldwide, Visa makes steady income through the fee it earns whenever the card is used. The company has nailed this business model, and its financials are proof of this.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the recent quarter, Visa beat expectations again and reported net revenue of 8.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year, while the payments volume increased by 8%. The processed transactions soared 11%, driven by resilient consumer spending. A further improvement in consumer spending could mean higher revenue in the coming quarters.\n\nOther than Europe, the company saw a 16% rise in cross-border volume, which shows its strong\u00a0global position. Visa is also one of the best dividend stocks to own. While the dividend yield is modest at 0.77%, it has raised dividends annually for the past 16 years, and its 10-year dividend annualized growth rate is\u00a0highly impressive\u00a0at 18%.\n\nVisa is an industry leader with a massive market share. It managed to thrive even during high inflation, which has set a rock solid momentum for 2024. Buy the stock whenever there is a dip, and you will never regret your decision. After the company announced results last week, half a dozen analysts raised their price target.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) excels in wealth management, and its numbers prove the same. This also helps the company remain resilient during times of economic downturn. Warren Buffet\u2019s favorite investment, Morgan Stanley, is a dividend stock worth holding on to for the long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at $92 as of writing, the stock looks highly undervalued to me. It has risen 30% in the past six months and only 4% over the year. While it is very close to the 52-week high of $95, it can keep moving higher.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s quarterly results show that investment banking has rebounded, and\u00a0the company\u00a0is building momentum for an excellent year ahead. Its wealth management unit grew by 5%, while the income from investment banking increased by 16%. The company reported\u00a0a revenue\u00a0of $15.14 billion and an EPS of $2.02, beating estimates.\n\nThe quarter saw a 138% surge in the EPS quarter-over-quarter and a 19% rise year-over-year. Despite a drop in the advisory revenue, Morgan Stanley saw a surge in debt underwriting revenue by over 100% YOY. The CEO stated, \u201cThe pipeline is clearly growing\u201d.\n\nThe company pays a dividend of $0.85 per share and has a yield of 3.69%.\u00a0 It has increased dividends for 11 consecutive years, and the positive momentum in the business could lead to a steady dividend hike.\n\nOnce interest rates are reduced, the stock could rally. This dividend stock under $100 is a strong buy. Analysts have raised the price target of the stock after the results.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is another company that has beat expectations regarding quarterly results. It reported an 11% YOY revenue growth to hit $15.8 billion and an impressive 34% YOY net income growth.\n\nThis number captured the attention of investors since it led to a 39% jump in the EPS. The current financials\u00a0prove\u00a0that American Express is set to benefit from the increase in the use of debit and credit cards. This ensures growth in any economic cycle.\n\nIt added 3.4 million new cards in the quarter, and as the world steadily moves towards cashless payments, American Express will continue to benefit. The most interesting information in the quarterly results is the growing demand from Gen Z and millennials, making American Express highly attractive to this\u00a0specific\u00a0demographic. About 60% of the new consumer accounts were from Gen Z and millennials.\n\nTrading at $238 today, this stock is up 26% YTD and 49% in the year. It has gone from $140 in October to $238 today. AXP stock is very close to the 52-week high, and any pullback is a solid buying opportunity. The management aims to see 9%-11% revenue growth through 2026.\u00a0It is also a dividend stock with a yield of 1.17%.\n\nLike\u00a0the other two companies mentioned here, over half a dozen analysts have upgraded their price target for AXP stock after the blowout quarterly results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some of the largest banks, fintechs, and even tech firms are coming together to form a group to get everyone on the same page.\n\nThe AI Readiness for Financial Services Industry Special Interest Group, or SIG, is launching through the Fintech Open Source Foundation, or FINOS, a hub for open innovation in finance. On the agenda? Deploying generative AI.\n\nFINOS members have signed on to advance this initiative, led by Citi, Scott Logic, Morgan Stanley, and ControlPlane. Databricks is an executive sponsor. Other FINOS members\u2014including the London Stock Exchange Group, Publicis Sapient, and EPAM\u2014are participating alongside new FINOS members such as Microsoft and Provectus.\n\nMorgan Stanley chairs FINOS\u2019 Open Source Readiness Special Interest Group, which will provide the blueprint for the AI Readiness SIG, Trevor Brosnan, global head of technology strategy, architecture, and modernization at Morgan Stanley, told me.\n\n\u201cWe're going to look at common challenges we all face\u2014whether it's developing threat models, risk frameworks, mitigation of those risks\u2014all the things that we need to address with financial services firms to onboard this technology,\u201d he explained. \u201cFINOS is that great kind of neutral location where we can discuss them.\u201d\n\nThe AI Readiness SIG could be useful for any financial institution looking to deploy generative AI, including national and even regional banks, Brosnan said.\n\nIan Micallef, head of developer enablement at Citi, told me that the initiative's organizers are currently \u201cat the stage of gathering interest and putting together a core group who are going to be able to commit the time and resources to move this forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems prudent that we don\u2019t do that in isolation, and that we come together and try to do that as a group,\u201d Micallef added. \u201cThe beauty of open source is that you are getting access to ideas beyond the boundaries of your organization.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to creating an AI framework, there\u2019s really no competition between banks, Micallef said. \u201cI put it akin to fire safety,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no firm in the world that wants their competitor to have a fire safety issue.\u201d\n\n\u2018Part of the future\u2019\n\nMore than a year ago, when ChatGPT first came on the scene, some major companies including financial institutions imposed restrictions on employees using generative AI. But the business case for harnessing the technology quickly became evident.\n\n\u201cOverall, the risks of not embracing generative A.I. far outweigh the risks of engaging with it,\u201d Citi CEO Jane Fraser wrote in a LinkedIn post in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial services leveraging AI isn't necessarily new, but large language models are making the tech available to everyone, Micallef said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be part of the future, just like Excel and other tools in the past have been transformative for CFOs.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley views AI as a mechanism to augment humans, Brosnan told me. \u201cWe look at it as, \u2018How can we help our financial advisors do what they do best, which is to serve their clients more effectively or efficiently at scale?\u2019\u201d Brosnan explained. Having machines to \u201cdo the work of synthesizing and organizing insights and knowledge\u201d allows \u201chumans to create those ideas in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nMar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Procter &amp; Gamble Stock (NYSE:PG): Dividend Hikes Don\u2019t Offset Valuation Concerns",
        "content": "Recently, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) announced its 68th consecutive dividend increase along with its Fiscal Q3 results. Renowned for its portfolio of 65 household-name brands, the consumer staples titan upheld its long-standing tradition of growing dividends annually. In fact, P&G\u2019s latest dividend hike marked a reacceleration from previous rates. Its Q3 report also included notable developments in earnings growth. Yet, the stock\u2019s unjustifiably rich valuation forces me to remain neutral on PG stock.\n\nP&G\u2019s Accelerating Dividend Hike Is Commendable\n\nP&G\u2019s most recent dividend hike broke a gloomy trend of underwhelming dividend increases. This April\u2019s dividend boost was by 7%, marking a reacceleration compared to the lackluster hikes of 3% and 5% in the two preceding periods.\n\nTo a certain extent, it was almost essential for the company to boost the pace of dividend growth. Given the persistent heat of inflation, now hovering around 3.5%, merely matching the pace of dividend growth seen last year would essentially erode investors\u2019 income and overall purchasing power in real terms. And given that P&G is primarily held by income-oriented investors and funds for its reliable dividend, another soft dividend hike would likely deteriorate investor confidence in the stock.\n\nDecent Q3 Report, Including Raised Guidance, Inspires Confidence\n\nP&G\u2019s dividend increase came along with its Fiscal Q3 report, which was decent. While sales figures came in quite soft, P&G\u2019s continuous focus on controlling costs and achieving internal efficiencies increased margins, leading to meaningful earnings growth. Thus, management felt comfortable enough to raise its prior guidance.\n\nIn particular, for Fiscal Q3, P&G posted net sales of $20.2 billion, up just 1% compared to last year. While net sales grew by 3% organically, entirely driven by higher pricing, the company faced a foreign exchange headwind of 2%, offsetting much of that increase. There was nothing out of the ordinary here. P&G\u2019s products continued to reflect consumers\u2019 regular purchasing patterns, with the majority of its brands comprising everyday household necessities.\n\nThe more interesting developments occurred in the company\u2019s margin profile following cost-control efforts. Specifically, P&G\u2019s core gross margin in Fiscal Q3 rose by 310 basis points year-over-year and by 400 basis points in constant currency.\n\nThe gain was powered by a 260 basis point gain from productivity savings, a 130 basis point gain from favorable commodity costs, and a 130 basis point gain from increased pricing. These gains more than offset the 100 basis point headwind caused by an unfavorable product mix and another 20 basis point headwind, mainly from product reinvestments.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, despite rising rates negatively affecting the profitability of most companies in the space these days, P&G\u2019s favorable credit profile and ongoing debt paydowns led to interest expenses rising by just 5% to $233 million. Hence, the ongoing margin expansion was able to have a significant impact on net earnings, which grew by 11% to $3.75 billion.\n\nAccordingly, management boosted its full-year guidance. While organic sales growth is still expected to be in the range of 4% to 5%, the ongoing margin expansion P&G is undergoing is expected to boost its full-year adjusted EPS growth to a range of 10% to 11% from last year\u2019s EPS of $5.90. This is better than its prior guidance for growth of between 8% to 9%. I believe this is a rather strong development from the consumer staples giant, which also explains management\u2019s decision to reaccelerate dividend growth.\n\nP&G\u2019s Valuation Remains Unjustifiably Rich\n\nDespite P&G\u2019s positive developments in earnings and dividend growth, I continue to find the stock\u2019s valuation unjustifiably rich. Remember that aside from the cost control efforts and favorable commodity price movements (which can easily be reversed) that led to earnings growth, revenue growth has been completely stagnant for years. P&G\u2019s last-12-month revenue growth CAGR (including Q3) over the past 10 years stands at just 0.5%. Even Q3\u2019s organic growth of 3% was entirely due to pricing.\n\nCost-control efforts can only improve profitability so much. Given the lack of meaningful top-line growth, I believe it will be impossible for P&G to sustain the current pace of earnings growth for a long time. A growth rate in the low-single digits over the medium term sounds more reasonable. But then, it\u2019s very hard to accept that P&G is currently trading at a hefty forward P/E of 23.2x. This is in line with its five-year average, even though interest rates have skyrocketed during this period.\n\nIn the meantime, the stock\u2019s yield of just 2.6% is hardly attractive these days when you can earn 5% on your cash with a lower degree of risk attached. The premium can largely be attributed to income-oriented investors holding P&G tight due to its tremendous legacy as a dividend growth stock. But that doesn\u2019t make justifying the ongoing valuation any easier.\n\nIs PG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street continues to appear more or less unbothered about Procter & Gamble\u2019s valuation, evident in the current sentiment surrounding the stock. Procter & Gamble has gathered a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. At $169.60, the\u00a0average PG stock forecast implies 4.9% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re pondering which analyst holds the key to navigating PG stock trades, look no further than Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). He is the most accurate analyst covering the stock, featuring an average return per rating of 10.91% and a 91% success rate over the past year. Learn more by clicking on the image below.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nOverall, Procter & Gamble\u2019s accelerated dividend hike, coupled with management\u2019s commendable efforts to improve profitability, paints a picture of soundness. However, despite these positive developments, the stock\u2019s rich valuation remains a concern. With stagnant sales growth and uncertainty regarding how long cost-control headways can last, its current valuation appears unjustified. As such, while P&G\u2019s status may continue to attract dividend investors to the stock, I would urge caution against downside potential.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s top currency official opted to keep market players in the dark over whether Tokyo had intervened in the currency market Monday following a sharp move in the market that sliced 2% off the dollar-yen exchange rate.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Leaves China With Tesla Driving Software Hurdles Cleared Musk Makes Surprise China Visit in Search of Tesla Revenue Boost Elliott Built \u2018Large\u2019 Stake in Buffett-Favored Sumitomo, Source Says Yen Rebounds Strongly After First Slide Past 160 Since 1990 Yen Watchers Ask When Japan Will Step In as Slide Accelerates\n\n\u201cI have nothing to say about whether or not Japan had intervened in the market,\u201d said Masato Kanda, vice minister for international affairs, when asked by reporters if authorities had stepped into markets to prop up the yen.\n\n\u201cWe cannot overlook the negative impact that excessive and abnormal FX fluctuations driven by speculation are having on the nation\u2019s economy,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we will continue to take appropriate measures as necessary.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s currency had slipped beyond the 160 mark against the dollar earlier in the day for the first time since 1990 adding to losses of more than 10% this year. The sharp strengthening of the yen around lunchtime briefly took the currency back to 155.06. Later in the afternoon it reached 154.54.\n\n\u201cA yen appreciation of about 4 yen within an hour is unlikely to occur in normal trading,\u201d said Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute in a note.\n\nRead more: Yen Rebounds Strongly After First Slide Past 160 Since 1990\n\nThe yen remains under pressure as a stark gap remains between interest rates in the US and Japan. With expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting rates repeatedly retreating, the yen has continued to weaken even after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the first time since 2007 in March.\n\nLast week\u2019s stand-pat decision by Japan\u2019s central bank and Governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s press briefing comments further fueled the slide in the currency.\n\nThe feeble yen, now worth less than half its value against the dollar back in 2012, is pushing up import prices and fueling inflation. That\u2019s adding to the squeeze felt by households and companies and generating discontent with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s government.\n\nStill, Japanese currency officials don\u2019t have a free hand to take action. They must balance the need to stop the yen plunging against the need to comply with international commitments to let markets determine rates. They must also assess the risk of any intervention being viewed as a failure and spurring further speculation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dynamics in the market are unlikely to change for the time being, leaving the yen in a vulnerable position. The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged when it meets later this week, and it will likely take a change in expectations over the path of US rates to turn the tide.\n\n\u201cThe effect of an FX intervention wouldn\u2019t be significant, it would only buy time,\u201d Kiuchi said.\n\nRead more: Why the Yen Is So Weak and What That Means for Japan: QuickTake\n\nJapan\u2019s reluctance to comment on the currency move may keep doubt in the minds of market players over the finance ministry\u2019s stance on intervention. That could serve the ministry\u2019s interests even if it hasn\u2019t stepped into markets by keeping traders warier over possible action.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that jittery market players and trading algorithms in thin liquidity were largely behind the moves as happened in October 2023. At that time, senior finance ministry officials also declined to comment on whether they had stepped into markets, an indication that maintaining uncertainty is part of the their forex strategy.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\u201cOur model shows the outlook for the yen is finely balanced, but that the risks are skewed toward appreciation. That means the window for successful intervention is open a little wider than usual.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Taro Kimura, economist\n\nFor the full report, click here\n\nTokyo releases figures on currency intervention at the end of each month, with the next statement due Tuesday at 7 pm local time. Japan spent around $60 billion to prop up the yen in autumn 2022.\n\nThe monthly announcement typically excludes the last couple of working days of the month. So in the case that Japan has stepped into markets Monday, the official figures won\u2019t be released until the end of May, enabling Kanda and his colleagues to try to keep market participants second-guessing the ministry\u2019s tactics for a month.\n\nJapan\u2019s Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki met Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Washington earlier in April and together with South Korea\u2019s Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok, they issued a three-way statement expressing concern over the sharp falls in the yen and the won.\n\nRead more: Yellen\u2019s Nod to Japan, Korea Adds Scope for Defending Yen, Won\n\nWhile that statement prompted some speculation of possible joint action to prop up the Asian currencies, the hurdle for large forays into the market remains high. Group of Seven agreements call on members to allow markets to determine rates, leaving wiggle room for action only if there are excessive or disorderly moves.\n\nYellen said last week that intervention in markets should occur \u201conly rarely\u201d and with excessive volatility and with prior consultation.\n\n--With assistance from Emi Urabe, Yuki Hagiwara and Isabel Reynolds.\n\n(Adds economist comment)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides US White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are lining up nearly \u20ac1 billion ($1.1 billion) of debt financing that will allow buyout shop CVC Capital Partners to hold on to Multiversity, one of its university investments, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJavier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World US Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes Plunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin\u2019s Glow Is Fading Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Huawei\u2019s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip\n\nThe bridge loan will support CVC\u2019s plan to move the Italian university group into a so-called continuation fund. Continuation funds are one of the tools deployed by investment firms to manage their portfolio companies, by allowing sponsors to roll over assets bought through older funds into a new vehicle. The process enables investors to either hold on to the assets for longer than the typical investment cycle, or to cash out of their stakes.\n\nOther underwriters on the debt raise include Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, CVC Capital Markets, UniCredit SpA, BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. A high-yield bond offering is expected to follow the raise, according to one of the people.\n\nThe company currently has \u20ac765 million in high-yield bonds outstanding which mature in October 2028.\n\nRepresentatives for CVC, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, BNP and UniCredit declined to comment, while those for Goldman, Deutsche and Credit Agricole didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\n\nCVC initially invested in Multiversity in 2019 through its CVC Capital Partners VII fund, and would go on to acquire the Italian online higher education provider two years later.\n\nIt now plans to transfer the business from CVC Capital Partners VII and into the new continuation fund, in which CVC Capital Partners VIII is also expected to be an investor, according to an April 16 statement. The fund will be structured as a single-asset vehicle, as Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nMultiversity has shown \u201cimpressive performance\u201d since CVC\u2019s initial investment, the private equity firm said in its statement, pointing to the business\u2019s ability to tap an \u201cunder served and largely under penetrated Italian undergraduate market.\u201d CVC also noted that the extension of the partnership would allow it to support Multiversity\u2019s growth ambitions while providing continuity and stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nLazard and Morgan Stanley are financial advisers to CVC on the transaction, which is subject to customary investor approvals.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea\u2019s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities A Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 most profitable banks in the US in 2024. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest news in the US banking industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024.\n\nThe US banking industry of 2024 is quite different from what consumers, analysts, and investors were used to before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Before the pandemic, interest rates were moderate and stood between 1.50% and 1.75% enabling banks to lend money to each other. However, after COVID-19 forced governments to shut down factories, hospitality establishments, and other business avenues, the rates were cut to nearly 0% in order to ensure that some economic activity remained and the drop in output was compensated to an extent by easy capital.\n\nHowever, as they say, there's no such thing as a free lunch, the inflationary surge after the lax monetary policies of the pandemic era has now resulted in interest rates eclipsing levels just before the Great Recession of 2008. Since banks are involved in the business of money, higher interest rates tie in quite closely to their operations. Generally, while consumers bemoan higher rates, banks are happy as they are able to widen their 'spread' and make more profits even if borrowing is dropping due to tighter monetary conditions.\n\nAdditionally, higher rates can also mean that banks find it difficult to manage their asset base, which is often another term for the funds that the banks have invested in securities such as bonds. Should rates fluctuate too much, then these securities have to be revalued, and the resultant losses can drive some of the biggest banks out of business. This became clear last year in the US banking crisis of 2023, and you can find out more details about it by reading Top 20 Most Profitable Banks in the World.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, April 2024 is seeing the start of the first earnings season of the year for US banks. Some of the biggest names in the US banking industry, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) are out with their latest financial results.\n\nStarting from Goldman Sachs since it has been one of the most troubled US banks as of late, its first quarter of 2024 results marked somewhat of a turnaround. Since the result, Goldman's shares are up by a cool 3.7% since its latest earnings results, and at the heart of this is Goldman's revitalized investment banking division that turned analyst expectations of a turnaround in deal making right. The bank's investment banking fees jumped by a whopping 32% in its latest results to stand at $2.08 billion. At the same time, Goldman's consumer banking division also reported a 24% growth in revenue, for a nice breath of fresh air after years of costly losses and write-downs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother record setting bunch of financial results in the US banking industry came from the New York City based The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK). Its first quarter earnings saw the bank post a respectable $4.53 billion in revenue, a modest figure when we consider banking behemoths the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). While we'll get to JPMorgan in a bit, BNY's latest quarterly revenue of $4.53 billion was the highest in its 240 year history. Not only did BNY's revenue beat analyst estimates of $4.39 billion, but its net income of $953 million and earnings per share of $1.25 also beat analyst estimates of $890 million and $1.19, respectively.\n\nHowever, as you might know, an earnings beat is not a guarantor of favorable share price performance after the earnings results. This was also true in the case of JPMorgan, whose $42 billion in revenue and $13.4 billion in net income were unable to prevent a 6.5% share price drop on the day of the earnings report. So why did JPMorgan's shares fall? Well, the US bank's net interest income dropped by 4% sequentially, a higher delinquency rate for the consumer banking division, and a disappointing decision to keep 2024 interest income guidance unchanged in the face of some quarters expecting an upward revision.\n\nOn the last bit, here's what JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum had to say during the accompanying earnings call:\n\nOur total NII guidance remains approximately $90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Markets NII guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the Markets business. And as a reminder, changes in Markets NII are generally revenue neutral. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned upfront.\n\nWith these details in mind and as the US bank stock earnings season kicks off, we decided to take a look at the most profitable banks in the US. Some notable names are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC). 20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024\n\nA person using a mobile device to access their bank account information.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable US banks, we ranked the 50 most valuable US banks market cap wise by their latest trailing twelve month net income and picked out the banks with the greatest profits.\n\n20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024\n\n20.

        "title": "Wall Street Winners: The 3 Biggest Analyst Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "Wall Street analysts are revisiting their rating calls in recent days and weeks amid the increase in market volatility, leading to some of the biggest analyst upgrades. While the S&P 500 remains comfortably in the green territory in 2024, the ongoing market pullback has forced analysts to rethink some of their recommendations to clients.\n\nThe pullback is part of a broader market correction influenced by various factors. Hotter-than-expected March inflation heightened worries about persistent inflation and potential Federal Reserve actions, possibly delaying a rate cut expected in June. Geopolitical tensions, notably between Israel and Iran, also drove investors towards safer assets, exacerbating the market\u2019s downturn.\n\nWriting about the current market conditions, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) equity strategists noted that the recent market behavior resembled a \u201cclassic hedge fund de-grossing,\u201d where there was significant selling in technology and momentum stocks, while traditionally higher-risk sectors like small caps saw unusual gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe banking giant indicated that current market conditions might not necessarily signal a shift to value and financial shares but rather a broader move to reduce risk. Wells Fargo also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding financial stocks, given a potentially less dovish Fed stance.\n\n\u201cWe have been surprised [by] equity volatility, and the VIX have been so well-behaved YTD, especially with rising rates and geopolitical risk,\u201d added the bank. \u201cOur late-2023 analysis suggested we would see a VIX spike in 1H24 and slight equity downside,\u201d the strategists said in a note.\n\nAs equity prices move lower, Wall Street sell-side analysts tend to refresh their models and look for opportunities to upgrade their recommendations amid more attractive valuations. Here are the three biggest analyst upgrades from last week.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNeedham & Company analyst Laura Martin has upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Hold to Buy and set a price target of $700.00 on the streaming giant\u2019s stock, marking one of the biggest analyst upgrades recently. The analyst\u2019s optimism is based on Netflix\u2019s impressive first quarter 2024 performance, where it reported revenues of $9.4 billion, marking a 15% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Still, shares for Netflix fell after the earnings report following a soft guidance.\n\nOn a more positive note, Netflix\u2019s subscriber base grew by 9.3 million, reaching 270 million, and its free cash flow was $2.1 billion for the quarter. As a result, Martin believes Netflix is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI, citing the company\u2019s tech-first approach and global scale, which maximizes data value.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, anticipated price increases and accelerating advertising revenue are expected to spur revenue growth and expand margins. The analyst also noted that Netflix\u2019s stable content spending, which remains around $17 billion, alongside its strategy to repurchase shares using its free cash flow instead of paying down debt, will likely result in free cash flow and return on invested capital surpassing estimates.\n\nEBay (EBAY) ebay app on a smartphone\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nEBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock received a strong boost last week after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts double-upgraded their recommendation to Overweight from Underweight. The price target on EBAY stock was nearly doubled to $62.00 per share.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s upgrade is grounded in the positive outlook on eBay\u2019s strategic shift towards broader site-wide horizontal solutions and the integration of generative AI technologies, which analysts anticipate will enhance both Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and adjusted EBIT.\n\nSpecifically, the broker projects a CAGR of 1% for GMV and 5% for adjusted EBIT from 2023 to 2026. Moreover, they believe eBay\u2019s return to positive FX-neutral GMV growth in a challenging economic environment will bolster investor confidence in the company\u2019s medium-term growth potential, possibly materializing sooner than expected in the first half of 2024.\n\nOne of the key drivers of the double upgrade is the fact that despite having a growth profile similar to Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), eBay currently trades at about a 35% discount based on 2025 EV/EBITDA estimates. That valuation gap, according to Morgan Stanley, offers a compelling case for potential multiple expansion if eBay successfully executes its strategic initiatives.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nHSBC analysts upgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock from Hold to Buy, also raising the price target from $180.00 to $225.00. This is one of the biggest analyst upgrades and is based on enhanced earnings projections fueled by expected growth in AMD\u2019s AI GPU revenue and improved performance across its non-AI segments.\n\nThe broker also adjusted the 2024 and 2025 EPS estimates upwards by 7% and 25%, respectively, resulting in new forecasts of $4.08 for 2024 and $7.43 for 2025. These revised estimates are significantly above the consensus, by 13% for 2024 and 31% for 2025.\n\nAnalysts said their latest move reflects the confidence in AMD gaining a 10% market share by 2025 and capitalizing on competitor Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) anticipated product transitions in the AI GPU space during 2024. Furthermore, HSBC suggests that under a bullish scenario for AMD\u2019s AI GPU business, there could be a further 16% upside potential to his already elevated 2025 EPS estimate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Adds more details from memo in paragraphs 3-5,7-9)\n\nBy Kane Wu\n\nHONG KONG, April 25 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia (PEA) is reorganising its teams in the region as its current chief executive of Asia Chin Chou is retiring, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.\n\nMorgan Stanley will carve out a China-focused team from the rest of the region that focuses on investments in onshore and offshore China, according to the memo.\n\nThe firm has appointed Jun Xu, who is currently head of its yuan-denominated investment funds, to lead all private equity investing in China, the memo said.\n\nXu joined Morgan Stanley in 2005 and has led the expansion of the yuan-denominated private equity business in China since joining Private Equity Asia in 2008.\n\nNirav Mehta and Arjun Saigal, currently co-heads of India PE, will take the role of co-heads of PEA ex-China, which will still invest across the region with India as its core focus, Morgan Stanley said in the memo.\n\nA spokesperson for the firm confirmed the content of the memo.\n\nChou will be retiring after a 35-year career with the Wall Street bank's private equity arm, with stints in its New York office in the late 1980s before coming to Asia in the 1990s to establish the business.\n\nHe served on the firm's Asia-Pacific Executive Committee and is a key leader in its five regional private equity funds in addition to overseeing the creation of the China yuan and Thai Funds.\n\nAndrew Hawkyard will also retire after 24 years with the PE Asia unit, most recently serving as the unit's chief investment officer, the memo said.

        "title": "Which Companies Will Join the Trillion-Dollar Team in 2024? Our 3 Best Guesses",
        "content": "The majority of leading global indices reached new highs in 2024, fueled by loose financial conditions and burgeoning enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI). In the U.S., this rally pushed the S&P 500 to fresh highs. And unwavering investor optimism and the prospect of stocks joining the trillion-dollar club maintained the surge.\n\nHistorically, the markets prefer challenging complacency among investors. This lesson seems particularly important today. Initially, market sentiment was buoyed by expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with predictions of up to seven reductions by January 2025.\n\nHowever, contrary to these expectations, recent data indicates stronger-than-anticipated economic growth and rising inflation. Yet, investors remain undeterred. They are pivoting to a narrative of a reaccelerating economy bolstering the markets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite this optimism, there are signs of caution. Analysts have been revising earnings estimates downward for this year and next, while the stock market\u2019s strength is concentrated in a select group of mega-cap stocks.\n\nTherefore, if rate cuts are unlikely and earnings fundamentals are weakening, what continues to drive the stock market\u2019s ascent? According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), two factors stand out.\n\nFirst, liquidity levels are unusually high. Significant cash inflows from banks, money markets and government stimulus outpace the Fed\u2019s tightening efforts. However, this influx of liquidity may be nearing its limit as the buffers of excess savings are depleted.\n\nSecond, excitement around AI\u2019s potential to enhance productivity is high. Morgan Stanley Research suggests AI could increase net profit margins for S&P 500 companies by 30 basis points next year, particularly benefiting sectors like software, consumer services and financial services.\n\nAs Wall Street analysts boost their S&P 500 targets, we look at three stocks joining trillion-dollar club as soon as this year.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has a market capitalization that exceeds $700 billion. The company has made a significant strategic bet on GLP-1 receptor agonists. In particular, its standout drug, Mounjaro (tirzepatide) targets obesity and type 2 diabetes. This has fueled a massive rally in LLY stock given the size of this untapped market.\n\nThis way, Eli Lilly capitalizes on the growing demand for effective weight-loss treatments, an area with substantial market potential. Mounjaro has shown promising results in clinical trials, demonstrating substantial weight loss. And it shows improvement in glycemic control, positioning Eli Lilly as a key player in this lucrative sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s exposure to the GLP-1 market enhances its portfolio and potential revenue stream. Recently, the U.S. Federal and Drugs Administration (FDA) reported that nearly every dosage of Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide-based product is currently experiencing a shortage.\n\nAlso, LLY said that it doesn\u2019t expect to meet demand for weight-loss drugs this year. As a result, this biotech giant remains uniquely positioned to see earnings rise in the coming years.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is strategically positioning itself within the burgeoning AI chip market. AVGO recognizes the increasing demand for high-performance semiconductors in AI applications.\n\nFurther, Broadcom\u2019s portfolio includes advanced networking and connectivity chips, essential for AI data centers and infrastructure. The company\u2019s investment in developing AI-specific technologies reflects a clear bet on the continued expansion of AI capabilities across various sectors.\n\nThis move not only diversifies Broadcom\u2019s offerings but also increases its exposure to the high-growth AI segment. In March, the company\u2019s stock surged on the back of the better-than-expected AI-focused analyst event.\n\nFinally, Broadcom reported a robust fiscal first quarter in March, with its adjusted EPS of $10.99 surpassing Wall Street\u2019s consensus by 6%. This performance was driven by strong results in the AI semiconductor sector and effective synergy realization immediately following its acquisition of VMware.\n\nThe company\u2019s market capitalization stands at almost $580 billion.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands to benefit significantly from rising oil prices, bolstered by its extensive upstream projects. The company\u2019s strategic investments in key areas such as the Permian Basin, offshore Guyana and Brazil are poised to boost its production capacity and operational efficiency.\n\nAs a leading player, XOM\u2019s focus on expanding its upstream operations not only strengthens its market position. But also, it aligns with global energy demands, ensuring sustained growth amid rising oil prices.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation could see its stock price explode in case the rising Middle East tensions translate into a direct conflict between Israel and Iran. Escalating tensions have raised fears of potential supply disruptions.\n\nThe uptick in oil prices, up almost 20% since January, poses a risk of further increasing gasoline prices across the U.S. and globally. As a result, companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron are positioned to benefit from the rapidly evolving situation. Hence, they would be stocks joining the trillion-dollar club.\n\nMoreover, Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities and Houthi attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea are also contributing to higher oil prices. Compounding these issues, analysts pointed toward a slower-than-anticipated rebound in U.S. oil production. It had been hindered by cold weather events in January, further tightening the supply.\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s market capitalization sits at just below $500 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

        "content": "David Solomon defeated a shareholder proposal seeking to separate his roles as CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs (GS), but the measure received double the support it did in 2023.\n\nThe preliminary tally released by the Wall Street giant at its annual meeting Wednesday showed 33% of shareholders in favor of the split, up from 16% last year.\n\n\"We are pleased that voting in support doubled from last year,\" said Luke Perlot of the National Legal and Policy Center, which sponsored the shareholder proposal. \"We are disappointed that these clear examples of excesses did not convince a majority to support our proposal.\" Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO David Solomon. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nPerlot argued that the dual role held by Solomon had shielded him from the accountability of past missteps, including the company's costly push into consumer banking.\n\nShareholders at Bank of America (BAC) also rejected a similar proposal Wednesday that would have separated the CEO and chairman roles held by Brian Moynihan. There were 31% in favor of it, as compared with 26% last year.\n\nBoth banks have argued they need the flexibility to determine the best leadership structure for their firms.\n\nSolomon and Moynihan are among several Wall Street bosses to be tested by such proposals this year.\n\nIn May, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s (JPM) Jamie Dimon and BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) Larry Fink will also face such tallies. And Citigroup (C) shareholders will vote next week to formalize a CEO-chair split in its bylaws, even though the company has had an independent board chair since 2009.\n\nOther big banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), Morgan Stanley (MS), already have separate CEO and chair positions.\n\nThe pressure to split the CEO and chairman roles in the US ramped up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Between 2010 and 2023, 76 companies within the S&P 500 did so, according to ISS-Corporate.\n\nBy the end of 2023, nearly 60% of S&P 500 companies had those roles split.\n\nThe Goldman vote was of particular interest to Wall Street observers because Solomon is emerging from his most challenging year ever as boss.\n\nDealmaking slowed across Wall Street and he grappled with a costly exit from consumer banking as well as a series of high-profile departures from the firm.\n\nThe firm\u2019s profit declined by 24% and Solomon\u2019s annual compensation still rose by the same percentage \u2014 to $31 million.\n\nISS and Glass Lewis both advised shareholders to cast votes Wednesday in favor of separating Solomon\u2019s roles.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK, April 23, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Graystone Consulting, a business of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), announced today that it was named by Coalition Greenwich, a leading global provider of strategic benchmarking, analytics, and insights to the financial services industry, as one of three consulting firms to receive the 2023 Greenwich Quality Leader* designation in Overall U.S. Investment Consulting among large consultants. This is Graystone\u2019s third consecutive year as a recipient of this distinction.\n\n\"Our clients are at the heart of Graystone, and we focus on bringing them the best of what our organization offers \u2013 boutique-level service backed by the extensive intellect, resources, and solutions of Morgan Stanley,\" said Jeremy France, Head of Institutional Consulting Solutions at Morgan Stanley. \"Because this designation truly reflects our clients\u2019 opinions, I\u2019m very proud of this honor as well as our incredible team.\"\n\nGraystone\u2019s overall score, which is the compilation of investment counseling and service factor scores, was one of the three highest among large consultants that received at least 10 evaluations in the Coalition Greenwich study.\n\nThis award was determined by research based on in-depth interviews with U.S. institutional investors between February and November 2023. Coalition Greenwich interviewed 708 individuals from 575 of the largest tax-exempt funds in the United States, including corporate, public, union, and endowment and foundation funds, with either pension or investment pool assets greater than $150 million.\n\nAbout Graystone Consulting\n\nGraystone Consulting, a business of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, provides a complete range of investment consulting services to institutional clients, which include corporations, educational institutions, faith-based institutions, endowments and foundations, healthcare organizations, insurance entities, and Taft-Hartley funds.

The 2023 Greenwich Quality Leader in Overall U.S. Investment Consulting (Large Firms) designation was awarded to three firms and is based on the results of interviews conducted by Coalition Greenwich as described above. The award is the product of numerical scores in Coalition Greenwich\u2019s proprietary studies that are generated from the study interviews. In addition to study interviews, the award is based on other criteria including assets under management and industry experience. Investment performance is not a criterion because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and advisors rarely have audited performance reports. Neither Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC nor Graystone Consulting pays a fee to Coalition Greenwich in exchange for the award; Graystone does not pay to have its clients participate in the study. The award is not indicative of participating firm\u2019s nor their financial advisors\u2019 past or future performance and may not be representative of any one client's experience because the results represent an average of all experiences of responding clients only.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Today as Investment Banking Rebounds",
        "content": "After a two-year slump, investment banking looks like it's entering the early stages of a recovery. Investment banks reported earnings growth of double-digit percentages in the first quarter, driven by strong initial public offering (IPO) markets and a pick-up in debt underwriting. Here are three stocks to buy today to capitalize on this recovery.\n\n1. Goldman Sachs is a direct play on investment banking\n\nGoldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) is the closest thing to a pure-play investment bank that you can invest in. It wasn't entirely by choice. The bank made a push into consumer banking in 2016 and aimed to take in deposits and build a more resilient earnings stream across cycles.\n\nThat push didn't fare well, and it began winding down its consumer business last year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTherefore, Goldman Sachs should be one of the biggest beneficiaries of active capital markets, which was the case in the first quarter. The company's earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled from the fourth quarter and grew 27%, compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestment banking fees of $2 billion increased 32% from last year, with good growth in advisory, equity underwriting, and debt underwriting, compared with last year. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon noted several large IPOs, including Reddit, which were well-received and showed an increased appetite for risk from investors.\n\nIn addition, corporate debt refinancing was a common theme. Solomon sees a more accommodating issuance backdrop and more financing for acquisition as two things that have the bank expecting \"solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year.\"\n\n2. Morgan Stanley's CEO says we're in the early stages of a recovery\n\nMorgan Stanley(NYSE: MS) is another bank with sizable investment banking operations. However, it differs from Goldman because it has built large asset and wealth management businesses. These more diversified earnings can help stabilize the bank's business during lulls in investment banking.\n\nMorgan Stanley's EPS surged 138% from the fourth quarter, and increased 19% compared with the same quarter last year. Its earnings revealed mixed results within investment banking. For example, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) were down, and advisory revenue fell 28%. However, equity underwriting and debt underwriting revenue increased 113% and 37%, respectively, compared to the same period last year.\n\nTed Pick took over as CEO in January after James Gorman, who led the bank since 2010, stepped down.\u00a0Pick told investors that, \"The pipeline is clearly growing\" and that we are now in the \"early innings of a multiyear M&A cycle\" that could last three to five years. That, coupled with recovering equity and debt underwriting markets, could be a powerful tailwind for investment banking revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Citigroup's efficiency push could get a boost from investment banking\n\nCitigroup(NYSE: C) may not be commonly known for its investment bank operations, but it raked in $903 million in revenue in the first quarter. A rebound in investment banking and Citigroup's ongoing initiatives to become more efficient make it an appealing investing opportunity.\n\nIn 2021, Jane Fraser became Citigroup's CEO. Fraser's primary focus became streamlining operations and improving the bank's profitability.\n\nCitigroup struggled with its sprawl and last year announced it would wind down 13 global consumer franchises. The bank recently restructured its management team and will continue to lower costs to improve its profitability. Its cost-cutting initiatives have some analysts very optimistic about the bank.\n\nCitigroup's investment banking revenue increased 35% from last year, thanks to the strength in equity and debt underwriting. Like Morgan Stanley, Citi's advisory revenue dropped because of fewer M&A deals during the quarter. However, debt issuance surged. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told investors that \"improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly investment grade, which is running at near-record levels.\"\n\nFraser noted, \"We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter.\" She expressed optimism, noting that, \"Corporate sentiment is quite positive.\"\n\nThis is a welcome sign for investment banks that have endured several years of sluggish growth. It makes these banks compelling value stocks to buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Goldman Sachs Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Goldman Sachs Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Goldman Sachs Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

Governance (\"G\") factors can include, but are not limited to, how an issuer operates, such as its leadership composition, pay and incentive structures, internal controls, and the rights of equity and debt holders.\n\nYou should carefully review an investment product's prospectus or other offering documents, disclosures and/or marketing material to learn more about how it incorporates ESG factors into its investment strategy.\n\nESG investments may also be referred to as sustainable investments, impact aware investments, socially responsible investments or diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\") investments. It is important to understand there are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. This is due to a current lack of consistent global reporting and auditing standards as well as differences in definitions, methodologies, processes, data sources and subjectivity among ESG rating providers when determining a rating. Certain issuers of investments including, but not limited to, separately managed accounts (SMAs), mutual funds and exchange traded-funds (ETFs) may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. Further, socially responsible norms vary by region, and an issuer\u2019s ESG practices or Morgan Stanley\u2019s assessment of an issuer\u2019s ESG practices can change over time.\n\nPortfolios that include investment holdings deemed ESG investments or that employ ESG screening criteria as part of an overall strategy may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results. For risks related to a specific fund, please refer to the fund's prospectus or summary prospectus.\n\nInvestment managers can have different approaches to ESG and can offer strategies that differ from the strategies offered by other investment managers with respect to the same theme or topic. Additionally, when evaluating investments, an investment manager is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the manager to incorrectly assess an investment\u2019s ESG characteristics or performance. Such data or information may be obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. Morgan Stanley does not verify that such information and data is accurate and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy, timeliness, or completeness when evaluating an issuer. This can cause Morgan Stanley to incorrectly assess an issuer\u2019s business practices with respect to its ESG practices. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products.\n\nThe appropriateness of a particular ESG investment or strategy will depend on an investor\u2019s individual circumstances and objectives. Principal value and return of an investment will fluctuate with changes in market conditions.\n\nDiversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in a declining financial market. Any securities mentioned are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell. Securities discussed in this report may not be appropriate for all investors. It should not be assumed that the securities transactions or holdings discussed were or will be profitable. Morgan Stanley recommends that investors independently evaluate particular investments and strategies, and encourages investors to seek the advice of a Financial Advisor. The appropriateness of a particular investment or strategy will depend on an investor\u2019s individual circumstances and objectives.\n\nMorgan Stanley makes every effort to use reliable, comprehensive information, but we make no guarantee that it is accurate or complete. We have no obligation to tell you when opinions or information in this report change.\n\nHistorical data shown represents past performance and does not guarantee comparable future results.\n\nInvesting in the markets entails the risk of market volatility. The value of all types of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (\"ETFs\"), closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, may increase or decrease over varying time periods.\n\nAn investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate, so that an investor\u2019s ETF shares, if or when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost.\n\nBecause of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.\n\nEquity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment. Companies paying dividends can reduce or stop pay-outs at any time.\n\nGrowth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.\n\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally, the longer a bond\u2019s maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Debt instruments issued by U.S. corporate and municipal issuers that provide a return in the form of fixed periodic payments and eventual return of principal at maturity. Fixed income investments are advantageous in a time of low inflation, but do not protect investors in a time of rising inflation. Interest income on government securities is subject to federal income taxes, but exempt from taxes at the state and local level.\n\nBond funds and bond holdings have the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the funds. The return of principal in bond funds, and in funds with significant bond holdings, is not guaranteed.\n\nMorgan Stanley, its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Individuals should consult their tax advisor for matters involving taxation and tax planning, and their attorney for matters involving legal matters.\n\nThis material may provide the addresses of, or contain hyperlinks to, websites.

        "title": "Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?",
        "content": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nMorgan Stanley in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -2.78% so far this year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.85 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.75%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.49% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.61%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.40 is up 4.6% from last year. In the past five-year period, Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.33%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Morgan Stanley's payout ratio is 59%, which means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nEarnings growth looks solid for MS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $6.77 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 23.99%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\n\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that MS is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Buyout Firm CVC Sets Price Range for \u20ac1.6 Billion Amsterdam IPO",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- CVC Capital Partners and some of its investors are seeking to raise \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) in an initial public offering in Amsterdam, as the buyout firm moves ahead with its long-delayed listing plans.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into Chaos TikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US Claims Trump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway Tesla Spends Weekend Cutting Prices of Cars and FSD Software China Is Front and Center of Gold\u2019s Record-Breaking Rally\n\nThe company and the investors are offering 114 million shares for \u20ac13 to \u20ac15 each, according to a statement on Monday. That gives the company an implied market value of \u20ac13 billion to \u20ac15 billion.\n\nCVC is issuing 18 million new shares, while existing investors will sell 96 million shares. Shareholders that are selling in the IPO include Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, Kuwait Investment Authority, a wealth fund run by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and certain management shareholders.\n\nNone of the firm\u2019s active employees are selling in the IPO, CVC said in an earlier statement.\n\nCVC has been working on a listing since at least 2022, with previous attempts buffeted by volatile markets. One of Europe\u2019s best-known buyout firms, CVC manages about \u20ac186 billion of assets and owns stakes in companies including Swiss watchmaker Breitling and Lipton Teas and Infusions, according to its website.\n\nBlue Owl Capital Inc. plans to invest in as much as 10% of the offering, according to the earlier statement, increasing its stake. A listing of CVC will test investor sentiment toward alternative asset managers at a key moment for the industry.\n\nIt will also mark a revival for listings in Amsterdam, which lost its position as one of Europe\u2019s busiest listing venues after a blowout year in 2021.\n\nThat\u2019s while a rebound in European IPOs is also underway, though investors are keeping an eye on trading. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index marked its third consecutive weekly drop last week amid concerns over the US Federal Reserve potentially keeping rates higher for longer and tensions in the Middle East.\n\nWhile investor appetite for listings is improving globally, the rebound in Europe has been uneven. Galderma Group AG, a skin-care company backed by CVC\u2019s private equity rival EQT AB, has soared above its offer price, and Spanish beauty and fragrance group Puig Brands SA is set to raise around \u20ac2.6 billion in an offering. CVC-backed German perfume retailer Douglas AG suffered a more disappointing stock market debut, however.\n\nStory continues\n\nCVC plans to use IPO proceeds to fuel growth, including scaling the next generation of its funds, pursuing acquisitions and funding a part of the price tag for its acquisition of a majority stake in DIF Capital Partners, announced in September.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires What Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Echo Wang and Abigail Summerville\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's North America head of consumer and retail equity capital markets (ECM) Tilli Dias Passi will leave the bank, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nPassi is taking an indefinite break and is not immediately joining a rival bank, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. Reuters could not immediately determine what caused her departure.\n\nNew York-based Passi has been with Morgan Stanley for 18 years, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her departure from the bank comes at a time when the market for initial public offerings (IPO) is showing early signs of a rebound in activity after stock market flotations dried up during most of 2022 and 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment. Passi could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nOver the past few years, some other senior IPO bankers have left Morgan Stanley to pursue other opportunities. In 2022, Lauren Cummings and Ashley MacNeill, who served as co-heads of the technology ECM team in the Americas, left the bank to join private equity firms Hellman & Friedman and Vista Equity Partners respectively.\n\n(Reporting by Echo Wang and Abigail Summerville in New York; Editing by Anirban Sen and Louise Heavens)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Having started the year on a highly optimistic note, the market has now turned into an uncertain zone. The inflation report and the pushback of Fed rate cuts have left investors worried. However, some stocks can survive a soft landing. These growth stocks weren\u2019t made in a day. These companies have a rich history, solid long-term potential and the ability to keep going even in turmoil.\n\nIf the economy continues to grow, we will see these companies report higher earnings. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at the growth stocks that can thrive in the long run. If you are ready to take the leap, invest $5,000 in these three growth stocks by 2025 and build a resilient portfolio.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy: DraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) has trended 22% higher since the beginning of the year and 112% in the past 12 months. That is no small feat, considering the high-interest environment. Trading at $42 today, this growth stock is a solid buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe online sports betting sector is set to grow in the coming years, and that means DraftKings is in a strong position right now. The company could see a higher valuation over the decade. Currently, it only exists in a few states, and as more states legalize online sports betting, DraftKing\u2019s market share will grow.\n\nFor Q4, 2023, the company reported a revenue of $1.23 billion, up 44% year-over-year (YoY), and reported a non-GAAP profit of $0.29 per share, up from the loss of $0.14 per share in the same period the previous year. Its monthly unique payers (MUP) stood at 3.5 million, and the average revenue per MUP came in at $116. For 2024, it is aiming for a revenue of $4.8 billion.\n\nSeveral analysts, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), have a bullish view on DKNG stock. Goldman Sachs has initiated the stock with a Buy rating with a price target of $60. It expects a 42% upside on the stock driven by healthy growth in existing states and an expansion after the legalization in other states. Morgan Stanley has a price target of $50 for the stock with an Overweight rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 14% year-to-date (YTD) and 23% in the year, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is making the most of the AI hype. Exchanging hands for $118 today, ORCL stock is racing ahead. It is building 100 data centers to expand its cloud services to other companies. That expansion is only the beginning as its current customers are more likely to adopt its solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a rich history and many years of experience in catering to the needs of clients. The company recently announced an investment of $8 billion in cloud computing and AI in Japan. Oracle reported impressive third-quarter results with a 7% YOY revenue surge and a 29% YOY rise in the order backlog to over $80 billion.\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) recently signed a deal with Oracle to deliver AI solutions to the government, and it also has a contract with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), where both companies will market their software and AI chips.\n\nIt could be a win-win situation for both the tech giants. There is no stopping the growth of Oracle, and it could make you big gains by 2025. It also pays a dividend and yields 1.35%, making Oracle one of the best AI stocks to own.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo matter how the market moves from here, people will not stop shopping at Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The company is a highly diversified business and has been holding strong over the past two years. Up 14% YTD, WMT stock is trading for $59 today, and I think it is highly undervalued. While it is close to the 52-week high of $61, it can keep moving higher.\n\nOne of the most popular retail chain stores, Walmart has been investing in the e-commerce businesses and saw a 23% surge in its global online sales in the fourth quarter. It manages more than 10,000 stores right now, and the business continues to focus on groceries, health and wellness products.\n\nKnown for offering lower-priced goods, the biggest grocery store chain isn\u2019t affected by the ups and downs of the market. That ensures the company posts strong financials and the stocks keep rallying upwards. WMT stock has soared 74% over the past five years.\n\nAnother reason to put money in this growth stock is its dividend yield. Walmart stock enjoys a yield of 1.39%, which makes it even more attractive for passive income investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Graphic: Morgan Stanley Wealth Management)\n\nInflation, election concerns mount\n\nNEW YORK, April 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley Wealth Management today announced results from its quarterly individual investor pulse survey:\n\nBullishness remained steady. Three out of five investors (60%) are bullish this quarter\u2014consistent with last quarter. Fewer investors are optimistic about the economy. Roughly half (53%) agree that the Fed will be able to execute a \"soft landing,\" down 7 percentage points from last quarter. Yet, fewer investors are making changes to their portfolio. Half of investors (50%) said they do not plan to make any changes to their portfolios for the next six months, significantly more than last quarter (42%). Additionally, only 10% plan on moving out of their current positions and into cash, down 4% from Q1. Inflation and election concerns have increased. Over half (53%) said that they were most concerned about inflation, up from 49%. Unease about the 2024 election ticked up to 31% from 26%.\n\n\"The US stock market is coming off one of its strongest first quarters of the past 20 years, and so it should not be too large a surprise to see it pull back,\" said Chris Larkin, Managing Director, Head of Trading and Investing, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. \"Yet despite economic uncertainty amid the revised pace of rate cuts for the year, along with uncertainty around the 2024 election, investors remain optimistic about the market.\"\n\nThe survey explored investor views on sector opportunities for the second quarter of 2024:\n\nIT \u2013 Amid continued interest in chipmakers and AI, technology remained the top choice for investors this quarter. Energy \u2013 After Q1 showed glimpses of recovery from 2023, interest in energy held steady as a second choice for investors as oil prices rallied to multi-month highs. Health care \u2013 Perhaps utilized as a hedge, the traditionally defensive health care sector secured the third spot at 36%.\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThis wave of the survey was conducted from April 1 to April 17 of 2024 among an online US sample of 875 self-directed investors, investors who fully delegate investment account management to financial professionals, and investors who utilize both. The survey has a margin of error of \u00b13.20 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. It was fielded and administered by Dynata. The panel is broken into three investable assets: less than $500k, between $500k to $1 million, and over $1 million. The panel is 60% male and 40% female and self-select as having moderate+ investing experience, with an even distribution across geographic regions, and age bands.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley Wealth Management\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, a global leader, provides access to a wide range of products and services to individuals, businesses and institutions, including brokerage and investment advisory services, financial and wealth planning, cash management and lending products and services, annuities and insurance, retirement and trust services.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is a leading global financial services firm providing a wide range of investment banking, securities, wealth management and investment management services.

        "title": "Results: Morgan Stanley Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) just released its latest first-quarter results and things are looking bullish. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 5.1% to hit US$15b. Morgan Stanley also reported a statutory profit of US$2.02, which was an impressive 22% above what the analysts had forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Morgan Stanley's 20 analysts is for revenues of US$57.5b in 2024. This reflects a modest 5.5% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to soar 25% to US$6.91. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$56.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.44 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Morgan Stanley's earnings potential following these results.\n\nThe consensus price target was unchanged at US$97.63, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Morgan Stanley at US$118 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$83.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 7.4% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 7.1% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 7.3% per year. So although Morgan Stanley is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Morgan Stanley's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Morgan Stanley. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Morgan Stanley analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou should always think about risks though.

        "content": "The battle against inflation is being won by the Fed \u2014 even if it doesn't appear that way to Mr. Market right now.\n\n\"The reality is that they [the Fed] have got to win the war on inflation, and they are winning, and it's coming down. They have got it on the right trend,\" Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdded Moynihan, \"The past would tell you it would take a longer period of time, especially when they started late.\"\n\nThere continues to be great focus on what Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Tuesday, that it will \"take longer than expected\" to get inflation down to Federal Reserve's 2% target. This comes as the latest economic data, such as retail sales and consumer prices, have surprised to the upside.\n\nLost in the Powell focus, though, were even more hawkish comments from Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson the same day.\n\n\u201cIf incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2%,\" Jefferson said.\n\nIn the wake of this commentary, fed funds futures are now pricing in only 40 basis points of rate cuts by year-end. Deutsche Bank pointed out this is the lowest this has been so far this cycle.\n\nDespite sticky inflation and more volatile markets, BofA managed to post an OK first quarter. But, pressure from higher charge-offs and softening credit quality did catch the attention of some on Wall Street.\n\nNet interest income fell 3% to $14 billion compared to the year-earlier period, roughly in line with consensus forecasts. Adjusted earnings of $0.83 a share beat analysts' estimates of $0.77 but dropped from $0.94 a year earlier.\n\nNet charge-offs increased to $1.5 billion from $807 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue fell 2% from the prior year to $25.8 billion, despite top-line gains in wealth management, investment banking, and sales and trading.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts, BofA hinted the first quarter would be the low point for the bank's key net interest income line \u2014 the difference between what banks pay on deposits and earn on loans.\n\nIn support of that, BofA's net interest income did improve by 1% sequentially in the first quarter and is projected to increase in the second half of 2024, BofA said.\n\nShares still fell about 4% during Tuesday's session but recovered by 3% on Wednesday.

(Photo by Aaron Schwartz/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images)\n\nThe stock was largely defended by Wall Street analysts following the Tuesday sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We get being bummed out about banks in this rising rate backdrop (which hopefully doesn\u2019t last), but feel BofA\u2019s strong capital markets performance, ongoing expense discipline, $31 billion and growing excess capital and multiple source of organic growth should continue to underpin a stable and steadily climbing top line, and therefore the stock,\" Evercore ISI Glenn Schorr wrote in a client note.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Q1 Earnings Top on Revival of IB Business",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS first-quarter 2024 earnings of $2.02 per share handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. The figure also compared favorably with $1.70 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, MS\u2019 net revenues of $15.14 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion. The top line grew 4% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason for Morgan Stanley\u2019s better-than-expected performance was the resurgence of the investment banking (IB) business. Since 2022, the performance of the IB business has been subdued because of a host of factors, including high inflation, central banks\u2019 monetary tightening policy and geopolitical tension, among others.\r\n\r\nThese factors kept the clients on the sidelines, and hence, global deal-making and underwriting activities almost crashed. Nonetheless, since mid-2023, some green shoots were visible in the IB business, with a proper rebound occurring in the first quarter of 2023. Morgan Stanley\u2019s quarterly performance immensely benefited from this revival.\n\nMorgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMorgan Stanley price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Morgan Stanley Quote\n\nIB Majorly Supports Revenues\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Institutional Securities (IS) segment, which mainly runs its capital markets operations, posted decent top-line performance in the first quarter. The segment\u2019s revenues grew 3% year over year to $7.02 billion, driven by increased underwriting revenues and equity trading revenues.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the company\u2019s equity underwriting income jumped 113% and fixed income underwriting income was up 37%. On the other hand, advisory business was still a weak point for Morgan Stanley, with advisory revenues declining 28%. Thus, total IB fees (in the IS segment) grew 16% to $1.45 billion.\r\n\r\nLikewise, JPMorgan JPM witnessed a decline in advisory fees while underwriting business performance improved. The company\u2019s equity underwriting fees jumped 51% and debt underwriting fees were up 58%. On the other hand, advisory fees fell 21%. Overall, total IB fees grew 21% from the prior-year quarter to $2 billion.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Goldman GS posted a solid improvement in advisory fees. The metric was up 24% year over year in the first quarter. Further, both debt and equity underwriting fees were up 38% and 45%, respectively. Its IB fees jumped 32% to $2.08 billion.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley also posted a decent trading performance. Equity trading revenues increased 4% year over year, while fixed-income (FICC) trading income declined 4%.\r\n\r\nSimilar to MS, JPMorgan witnessed lower FICC markets revenues, while equity markets revenues remained stable. Here GS also bucked the trend, and both FICC and equity revenues grew 10% each in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the performance of Morgan Stanley\u2019s Wealth Management and Investment Management segments was decent in the first quarter. The company witnessed a 21% year-over-year rise in total client assets and a 10% increase in total assets under management or supervision.\r\n\r\nThus, the company\u2019s fee income grew 10% to $13.34 billion. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley\u2019s net interest income declined 23% because of higher interest expenses.\r\n\r\nFurther, non-interest expenses for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company increased during the quarter. The metric was $10.74 billion, up 2% from the prior-year quarter.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 16, 2024\n\nMorgan Stanley isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning. Welcome to Morgan Stanley's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following information and disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplements, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements in this discussion. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Ted Pick.\n\nTed Pick: Good morning, and happy spring in New York. Thank you for joining us. We entered 2024 with optimism, encouraged by improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our institutional and wealth management clients, the quarter was strong. We generated $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2.02 in earnings per share and a 20% return on tangible equity. In a relatively constructive environment, these results highlight the power of our clear and consistent strategy, serving as trusted advisor to our clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. During the quarter, higher asset prices and an improved economic backdrop supported confidence with our wealth management client base.\n\nWe saw greater activity both in the advisor based and self-directed channels, resulting in higher adjusted margins of 27%. Net new assets grew by $95 billion. Investment Management also generated positive long-term flows in the quarter. Across both wealth and investment management, total client assets grew to $7 trillion advancing toward our $10 trillion goal. As the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters, it was great to see us regain our leadership position in equity capital markets. More broadly, we saw building momentum in investment banking, both in our M&A and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients. [Audio Gap] both generated very solid results to round out a strong quarter in institutional securities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs ever, we remain focused on managing our resources, sweating the income statement and being judicious with our capital. Our CET1 ratio was 15.1%. Our excess capital position allows us to support our clients, invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders, particularly as regulators continue to evaluate Basel III endgame. Additional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our global franchise, further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm. I wanted to touch on the topic of client onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with 3 short observations. First, this quarter's wealth management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board, including strong margins and very strong net new assets.\n\nWe are really pleased with this terrific performance and we are going to keep ongoing. Second, this is not a new matter. We've been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while. We have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large banks do. As James said in January, we want to ensure we continue to be world class in every aspect of this growing business. And third, to be clear, this is about processes. We have been spending time, effort and money for multiple years, and it is ongoing. We've been on it. And the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate. To conclude, the first quarter of 2024 aligns with the goals outlined in the January strategy deck: $15 billion of revenue, a 71% efficiency ratio, $2 of earnings, $7 trillion of client assets, and a 20% return on tangible.\n\nWe have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm. While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis. I'm very optimistic what lies ahead for Morgan Stanley. And on behalf of our 2,300 Managing Directors and 80,000 employees, say to those listening to the call, we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and in its intensity. Now, I'll turn it over to our excellent CFO, Sharon Yeshaya to discuss the quarter in more detail.\n\nSharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. In the first quarter, the firm produced revenues of $15.1 billion. Our EPS was $2.02 and our ROTCE was 19.7%. Our model is working as intended. The first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our scaled business and an improving backdrop. Benefits of durable revenues, particularly asset management fees in the wealth management business, stronger capital markets and a continued focus on managing the full income statement, all contributed to results. The firm's first quarter efficiency ratio was 71%, illustrating the inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following multiple years of integration. Efforts are evidenced by the year-over-year reduction in professional services and marketing and business development spend, lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio.\n\nNow to the businesses. Institutional securities revenues of $7 billion were up 3% versus the prior year, reflecting strong performance across businesses. First quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our cross divisional collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities. The geographical breadth continues to distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions. Investment banking revenues were $1.4 billion for the first quarter, up 16% from the prior year. A pickup in both equity and fixed income underwriting supported results, offsetting the year-over-year decline in advisory. Leading indicators continued to progress positively, including the preliminary reemergence of sponsor activity.\n\nAdvisory revenues of $461 million reflected a decline in completed M&A transactions. Equity underwriting revenues of $430 million more than doubled versus the prior year as IPO markets reopened for most of the quarter alongside conducive markets for follow-ons. Our global reach supported our ability to lead cross-border transactions, and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting lead tables as global market volumes picked up. Fixed income underwriting increased year over year to $556 million, results were driven by strength in investment grade and noninvestment grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads. Looking ahead, we expect the steady build of this business to continue. We are encouraged by the health of the advisory and underwriting pipelines.\n\nWhile the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the near-term conversion of pipeline to realized, conditions should improve over time and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is increasing. We remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires, particularly as we continue to see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity. Turning to Equity, we continue to be a global leader in this business. Revenues were strong increasing 4% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. Results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash, and the franchise benefited from the scale of our prime brokerage business. Cash revenues increased year-over-year, reflecting broad based strength in equity markets across the region. A panoramic view of a financial institution, representing the number of corporations who trust the company's services.\n\nPerformance in Japan was particularly strong supported by higher volumes. Our increased coverage augmented by our longstanding and unique partnership with MUFG should be supportive over time. Derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well and client activity was strong. Prime Brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards all-time highs on higher market levels. Results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads. Fixed income revenues were $2.5 billion results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year. Recall, last year's result benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events, including those related to the U.S. regional banks.\n\nClient demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset, reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise. Macro and micro revenues declined modestly year-over-year on lower volatility and client activity, which resulted in less transactional flow. Results in commodities increased year-over-year, supported by higher revenues in the North America Power and Gas business. Turning to Wealth Management. The business delivered strong results across all key metrics, demonstrating the continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built. Record revenues increased from the prior year to $6.9 billion driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs.\n\nTransactional revenues, excluding DCP, were also strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors. Importantly, net interest income remained in line sequentially. Pre-tax profit was $1.8 billion and the PBT margin was 26.3%. Together, DCP and the FDIC special assessment impacted the margin by approximately 115 basis points. The results highlight the inherent operating leverage embedded in the business, particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong fee-based flows as clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds. Net new assets for the quarter were strong at $95 billion with contributions from multiple channels including our family office offering. Over time, our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets and lead to share capture.\n\nFee-based flows of $26 billion were strong. Within fee-based flows this quarter, we saw particular strength from the migration of assets from the advisor led brokerage accounts to fee-based accounts. This demonstrates that over time, assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenue generating accounts. Fee-based assets now stand at over $2 trillion. Asset Management revenues were $3.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong fee-based flows. Transactional revenues were $1 billion and excluding the impact of DCP, were up 9% versus the prior year. The first quarter's results were driven by client engagement across products, including record activity in structured products.\n\nInvestments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand. Bank lending balances were $147 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting modest growth in mortgages. Total deposits of $347 billion were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset by continued demand for our savings offering. While sweep balances were down on a spot-to-spot basis, average sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter, broadly consistent with our modeled expectations. Net interest income was $1.9 billion flat to the fourth quarter's results, consistent with our guidance. The moderate increase in average deposit cost was offset by several factors, including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates.\n\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels.\n\nTotal AUM increased to $1.5 trillion, long-term net flows were strong at $7.6 billion inflows were driven by strengths in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering. Within alternatives and solutions, demand for parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients, including our own wealth management clients, allocated investments to Parametric's equity based products, underscoring the value of the integrated model. Flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies. Liquidity and overlay services had out close of $12.9 billion. Performance based income and other revenues were $31 million. Gains in U.S. private equity and private credit offset lowered accrued carried interest in Asia private equity and real estate demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform.\n\nWe are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business. We remain focused on customization, private credit and our global distribution. Parametric, in particular, has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm, evidenced by the ongoing demand from our wealth management client base. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.1%, down 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Standardized RWAs increased quarter-over-quarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive markets. We continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, buying back $1 billion of common stock during the quarter. Our tax rate was 21% for the quarter. The vast majority of share based award conversion takes place in the first quarter resulting in a lower tax rate.\n\nWe continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do. With client assets at a record of $7 trillion across Wealth and Investment Management, we are on strong footing. Our Wealth Management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice in delivering our differentiated offering, and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint. This combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time.\n\nWith that, we will now open the line up to questions.\n\nSee also\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in Georgia and\n\n10 Dividend Stocks with Over 9% Yield According to Analysts.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Adds Asia investment banking outlook in the 6th and 7th paragraphs; and China IPO data in the 11th paragraph)\n\nHONG KONG, April 17 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley and HSBC are cutting dozens of investment banking jobs in the Asia Pacific region this week, sources said, as they ramp up cost-cutting, with weaker dealmaking and sluggish markets in China and Hong Kong weighing on business prospects.\n\nMorgan Stanley is cutting at least 50 investment banking jobs in the region starting this week, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, affecting around 13% of the Wall Street bank's Asia investment banking workforce of 400.\n\nLayoffs at the investment banking unit of HSBC, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, started on Tuesday and is expected to see the departure of around 30 dealmakers in the region this week, three separate sources said.\n\nAll of the sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment on the job cuts. HSBC did not respond to a Reuters query on Wednesday.\n\nMore global investment banks may follow suit in the near future as they come under increased pressure to rein in costs amid rapidly falling income from the capital market and M&A advisory businesses.\n\nThe move marks a reversal of fortune for Wall Street banks in Asia which had expanded their operations a few years ago to grab a bigger share of the dealmaking activities in the region, especially in China.\n\nThe cuts at Morgan Stanley and HSBC are among the largest for the two banks' China-focused investment banking teams and follow similar measures by other banks stung by a decline in deal-making activities in China amid a slowing economy.\n\nThe top listing destinations for Chinese companies are facing a drought in dealmaking and shrinking valuations.\n\nHong Kong's stock exchange saw 12 initial public offerings (IPOs) raise HK$4.7 billion ($600.28 million) in the first quarter, a drop of 30% year on year and the worst since 2009, according to data from Deloitte.\n\nMoney raised via IPOs by Chinese companies, including both on onshore and offshore bourses, plunged 80% in the first quarter of this year compared to a year-ago period to $2.9 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nIPOs in mainland China dropped 82% from a year earlier to just $2.4 billion during the same period, the smallest quarterly fundraising since the fourth quarter of 2018, showed the LSEG data.\n\nThe total value of merger and acquisition deals with China involvement shrank by 36%, according to LSEG data, pointing to smaller fees bankers earned from clients by advising on such transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, a new round of staff cuts that began in late 2023 on the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, key regional investment banking hubs of Western banks, is set to gather pace this year, bankers and recruiters have said.\n\nIn January, Bank of America laid off around 20 bankers in the region, following a flurry of investment bank downsizing by UBS, Citigroup and other boutique firms.\n\nOutside Asia, U.S. banking giants overall continued to shed employees in the first quarter, with Citigroup seeing the biggest drop. Banks are under pressure to control costs due to the uncertain economic outlook.

        "title": "Wall Street says a Wall Street revival is finally here",
        "content": "Wall Street is surging again. This time, bank executives say it\u2019s for real.\n\nBank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) all reported first-quarter jumps in investment banking.\n\nThey did so because initial public offerings, bond issuances and in some cases M&A deal making beat analyst expectations.\n\nCollectively those revenues at the five big banks were up 26.6% from a year ago, to $8.08 billion. The biggest jump of 34% belonged to Bank of America, followed by 32% increases at Goldman and Citigroup.\n\nCEOs are not hiding their enthusiasm for the turnaround, following two years of depressed dealmaking.\n\n\"The pipeline is clearly growing,\" Morgan Stanley boss Ted Pick told analysts Tuesday, repeatedly using the world \"bullish\" to describe his outlook.\n\nWall Street is in the \"early innings of a multi-year M&A cycle.\"\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon said Monday that \"it's clear that we're in the early stages of reopening the capital markets, adding that \"I've said before that historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever.\"\n\nThe investment banking rebound for these banks couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, serving as a boost while higher interest rates begin to eat away at more traditional consumer banking margins. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nWall Street has been waiting two years for this moment, enduring repeated false starts.\n\nLast year was supposed to be the year things turned around as executives touted a string of IPOs and merger announcements. Instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade, as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. (Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (SAUL LOEB via Getty Images)\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\n\"We've grown tired of predicting\" when investment banking will return, Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick said in October.\n\nBut this time CEOs are sounding more optimistic, citing the need for companies to grow or restructure following the pandemic along with mandates for private equity to return gains to their investors \u2014 known as limited partners (LPs).\n\n\"Corporate boardrooms have been quiet for three, four years and that is not sustainable,\" Morgan Stanley\u2019s Pick said. \"They need to move.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLimited partners that invested with private equity firms are \u201cputting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Solomon added.\n\n\"And so I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters.\"\n\nTrading was another positive for the five big Wall Street banks in the first quarter, as that revenue rose nearly 1% from last year to $31.52 billion and exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nEquities were stronger than fixed income. Only Goldman Sachs earned revenue from fixed-income trading that was higher from a year ago. Jim DeMare, head of global markets at Bank of America. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBank executives are being more careful not to hype expectations for trading, given how difficult revenues for the business can be to predict.\n\nBut changing expectations for the US and global economy did increase client activity at these banks.\n\n\"I still think there's uncertainty. You can't predict the future and as a result, clients have to kind of adjust their portfolios,\" Jim DeMare, Bank of America\u2019s head of global markets, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"That results in more business and good activity for us,\" he added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Is Planning Biggest China Job Cuts in Years",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley plans to start cutting about 50 investment-banking jobs in the Asia-Pacific region this week, with at least 80% of the reductions in Hong Kong and China, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding What If Fed Rate Hikes Are Actually Sparking US Economic Boom? China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Powell Signals Rate-Cut Delay After Run of Inflation Surprises US Yields Spike as Hawkish Powell Puts 5% in Play: Markets Wrap\n\nThe planned cuts affect about 13% of the 400 bankers in the region, excluding Japan, one of the people said. More than 40 people in Hong Kong and mainland China are expected to lose their jobs in the coming round, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.\n\nThe final size and timing of the cuts may change, the people said. A media representative for the New York-based bank declined to comment.\n\nThe job cuts would be the deepest in years for Morgan Stanley in China, its biggest market in the region. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is struggling to find a firm footing due to a prolonged real estate crisis and persistent doubts over growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley reported Tuesday that net revenue from Asia fell 12% to $1.74 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, even as its global results topped forecasts. Earnings for the quarter totaled $3.4 billion, on $15.1 billion in revenue, lifted by trading.\n\nThe firm delayed the layoffs late last year, betting that historically low bonuses for dealmakers would spark voluntary departures, one of the people said. Only a few bankers left, prompting the company to make deeper cuts as revenue from China continues to slide. The bank plans to start communicating with the affected employees this week, the people said.\n\nGlobal financial firms are seeking to reduce expenses amid a deal drought, and have been cutting investment-banking staff in Asia amid deteriorating US-China relations, along with a crackdown on private enterprise and a property crisis.\n\nStock sales by Chinese firms in the US and Hong Kong plummeted to a two-decade low of $1.7 billion in the first quarter, about 30% of the volume in the same period last year, and just 4.3% of the level seen in the 2021 peak, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nHSBC Holdings Plc on Tuesday started a new round of reductions of about a dozen bankers, joining UBS Group AG and Bank of America Corp., which cut jobs earlier this year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have made unprecedented rounds of job cuts in the past two years in Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nPay for most senior investment bankers at Wall Street firms in Asia dropped to the lowest level in almost two decades last year, with total compensation for many dipping below the $1 million or more they typically earn. At least 20% of managing directors at banks, including Morgan Stanley and UBS, received no bonuses, Bloomberg reported in January.\n\nRead more: Goldman, Citigroup Begin Cutting About 35 Dealmakers Across Asia\n\nMorgan Stanley last year reduced its investment-banking head count in the region by about 7%, with China-focused bankers taking the biggest hit, following major cuts in 2022.\n\nStill, Morgan Stanley is gradually building its onshore China business. It won approval for principal trading and research licenses last month, after obtaining the go-ahead to set up a futures company and take full ownership of its fund management business last year.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley Hires Huang for China Asset Management Drive\n\nThe bank also made some senior hires for its investment-banking division this year, including Michael Ginzburg from Goldman Sachs in Australia, and ex-Credit Suisse banker Seiwon Kim in Korea.

        "content": "HONG KONG (Reuters) \u2014 Morgan Stanley and HSBC are cutting dozens of investment banking jobs in the Asia Pacific this week, sources with knowledge of the matter said, as weaker deal activities and sluggish markets in China and Hong Kong weigh on their business prospects.\n\nMorgan Stanley is cutting at least 50 investment banking jobs in the region starting this week, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, affecting around 13% of the Wall Street bank's Asia investment banking workforce of 400.\n\nLayoffs at the investment banking business unit of HSBC, which makes the bulk of its revenues and profits in Asia, started on Tuesday and is expected to see the departure of around 30 dealmakers in the region this week, three separate sources said.\n\nAll of the sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment on the job cuts. HSBC did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on Wednesday.\n\nThe cuts are among the largest to the two banks' China-focused investment banking teams and follow similar measures by other banks stung by a decline in deal-making activities in China amid a slowing economy.\n\nA new round of staff cuts that began in late 2023 on the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, key regional investment banking hubs of western banks, is set to gather pace this year, bankers and recruiters have said.\n\nThe top listing destinations for Chinese companies are facing a drought in dealmaking and shrinking valuations. Hong Kong's stock exchange saw 12 IPOs raise HK$4.7 billion ($600.28 million) in the first quarter, a drop of 30% year on year and the worst since 2009, according to data from Deloitte. FILE PHOTO: Logo of HSBC is seen on its headquarters at the financial Central district in Hong Kong\n\nMoney raised via China IPOs also plunged two-thirds from a year earlier to just $2.4 billion during the same period, the smallest quarterly fundraising since the fourth quarter of 2018, and down 82% from a year earlier, preliminary LSEG data showed.\n\nThe total value of merger and acquisition deals with China involvement shrank by 36%, according to LSEG data, pointing to smaller fees bankers earned from clients.\n\nIn January, Bank of America laid off around 20 bankers in the region, following a flurry of investment bank downsizing by UBS, Citigroup and other boutique firms.\n\n(Reporting by Selena Li, Julie Zhu and Kane Wu in Hong Kong, Scott Murdoch in Sydney; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Jacqueline Wong)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Financial Services Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "The financial services scene finds itself in a predicament these day.\n\nTraditional heavyweights like big banks face a wide range of financial technology companies seeking to expand their financial service offerings.\n\nIn fact, tech-leveraging firms have been trying to disrupt banking for quite some time now. But they have enjoyed limited success going against the financial heavyweight champs. With the rise of generative and predictive artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps fintech companies may finally have a window of opportunity. And then, they can meet the needs of consumers dissatisfied with big bank services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIndeed, all generations have turned to tech-focused payment platforms over the years. But the big banks haven\u2019t been slouches, either, investing heavily to digitize their platforms for the new age.\n\nEither way, the financial services scene stands to benefit as AI-induced automation looks to drive costs lower and growth higher. Let\u2019s explore three financial services stocks that look like intriguing bets for the second quarter.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Square, Block (NASDAQ:SQ) stock has been recovering nicely since late October lows. That was until a notable downgrade to underweight from neutral by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) dragged shares down to $73.50. That represents more than 14% lower from its 52-week highs.\n\nIndeed, underweight (the equivalent of a sell) ratings are quite rare on Wall Street. Investors would be wise to reconsider SQ as it looks to give up more of the gains it posted since reporting its latest solid quarter and upbeat outlook.\n\nTherefore, the main draw to SQ stock is valuation. It\u2019s incredibly cheap for a tech-forward fintech, with shares going for a mere 2.06 times price-to-sales (P/S).\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 2000, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has hit speed bumps in recent years. Lately, the stock\u2019s been choppy, but shares have risen 26% since last year\u2019s depths. And, it has one of the cheapest multiples (12.4 times forward P/E) in the fintech scene today. PayPal could be a comeback kid for those who believe the firm will be all right as its new CEO Alex Chriss rights the course.\n\nAlso, Chriss sees potential for productivity gains as the firm streamlines operations. Truely, PayPal\u2019s AI firepower may have been impressive to some. But I fail to see how such innovations can help power durable long-term growth, especially as PayPal\u2019s competitors also invest in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot all analysts are convinced PayPal will be able to move earnings per share (EPS) growth considerably higher anytime soon.\n\nDaiwa Capital Markets downgraded the stock back in February, noting that \u201cit will take some time\u201d before recent improvements work their way into the numbers. Indeed, Chriss\u2019 big moves are not going to pay off overnight.\n\nThen again, when expectations are so low with a valuation that I think is bordering on deep-value territory, it may not take much to get PYPL stock going again.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeavyweight American Express (NYSE:AXP) has been retreating after its impressive spike to all-time highs. This is thanks in part to a big downgrade from Barclays, primarily due to valuation concerns. For a stock that\u2019s risen over 60% in a matter of months, do the multiples make sense?\n\nAt writing, AXP stock trades at 19.5 times trailing P/E, which is undeniably on the pricy side of the historical valuation range. Still, the stock still appears cheap relative to its credit card rivals. Also, its wealthier-than-average cardholders have the capacity to keep spending, despite macro headwinds. This makes American Express one of the more resilient financial services stories in the entire market right now.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s hard to overlook momentum in Gold and Platinum card acquisitions lately, especially among younger generations. Millennials and Gen Z are significantly driving AXP business growth. As the two generations build wealth over time, demand for the most premier cards isn\u2019t likely to slow down. American Express updates and improves the benefits, rewards and other perks of having the centurion in one\u2019s wallet.\n\nSure, expectations and valuations have crept up in recent months. But it may be a bad idea to bet against the financial services juggernaut, with earnings on tap for April 19, 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of American Express.

        "title": "Wall Street bosses cheer investment banking gains but stay cautious",
        "content": "By Tatiana Bautzer and Saeed Azhar\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's bosses are finally seeing signs of a broader pickup in investment banking, but they are not cheering too loudly just yet.\n\nInvestment banking divisions showed robust growth in the first quarter for the largest U.S. banks, which reported surging revenues and fees. Capital markets led the comeback, executives said.\n\n\"We have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm,\" Morgan Stanley's new CEO Ted Pick told analysts on a conference call after his first quarter at the helm. \"While the pipelines are healthy, there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMorgan Stanley's investment banking revenues jumped 16% to $7 billion in its first quarter, it reported on Tuesday, sending shares up more than 3%.\n\nAt Bank of America, fees from investment banking surged 35% to $1.6 billion, but its stock fell more than 4% as it set aside more money to cover souring loans.\n\n\"We're just happy to see the investment banking activity improve,\" BofA's finance chief Alastair Borthwick told journalists. He cited efforts to deepen is presence in middle markets and boost collaboration between corporate and commercial bankers.\n\n\"It appears that a rising tide has been lifting all capital market boats here,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, adding that Morgan Stanley's performance was \"excellent.\"\n\nThe results echoed strong performances at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. While executives cited the return of some activity, they were also quick to point out risks, including interest rate uncertainty, escalating geopolitical conflicts and the U.S. election.\n\n\"I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever,\" Goldman's CEO David Solomon told investors on a conference call Monday. \"CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman shares rallied 3% after profits rose 28%, beating analyst expectations.\n\nEquity capital markets have been a bright spot in recent months as several prominent initial public offerings (IPOs) fueled optimism that more activity would follow.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter,\" Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told analysts on Friday.\n\nCiti's investment banking fees climbed 35% in the first quarter, lifted by debt and equity capital markets. Yet mergers and acquisitions (M&A) were still slow to emerge, Fraser said.\n\n\"Corporate sentiment is quite positive, especially in the U.S., and our clients around the world have very sound balance sheets,\" she said. Still, markets were too \"benign\" in pricing in risk factors such as geopolitical conflicts, she added.\n\nCiti hired JPMorgan's former co-head of investment banking, Viswas Raghavan, who is tasked with growing its banking revenues when he joins later this year.\n\nAt JPMorgan, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum also struck a cautious note even as investment banking revenue climbed 27% to $2.0 billion.\n\n\"While it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue,\" Barnum told analysts on a call on Friday. \"And the advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley's Pick is more optimistic than other CEOs on the effect of geopolitical risks, saying in some cases it can even create incentive for international deals if global conflicts affect supply chains.\n\n\"We are in the early innings of a multi-year M&A cycle,\" said Pick at Morgan Stanley, who described investment banking and capital markets as being in the early to middle parts of the business cycle. \"We should continue to see all kinds of underwriting... I'm feeling good about this.\" Large M&A announcements in multiple industries presented recent signs of rising confidence from CEOs and boards, that would support capital markets, Fraser said.\n\nGoldman's Solomon expects private equity firms, or financial sponsors, to get more involved in deals in an effort to start returning capital to investors.\n\nFraser, meanwhile, noted financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion that they need deploy.\n\nCitigroup shares are up nearly 11% so far this year, outpacing peers including JPMorgan and Bank of America, which have gained 6% and 3%, respectively. Goldman shares have risen 3%, contrasting with a 3% decline for Morgan Stanley. The S&P 500 banks index has climbed 6%.\n\n(Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer and Saeed Azhar in New York, additional reporting by Nupur Anand, editing by Lananh Nguyen and Nick Zieminski)",

We\u2019ve been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick said Tuesday on the first-quarter earnings call. \u201cWe have ongoing communications with our regulators, as all the large banks do.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley shares took a dive last week after a report in the Wall Street Journal that a number of US regulators are scrutinizing the firm\u2019s efforts to prevent potential money laundering by wealthy clients.\n\n\u201cThis is about processes,\u201d Pick said. \u201cWe have been spending time, effort and money for multiple years and it is ongoing. We\u2019ve been on it. And the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate.\u201d\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other Treasury Department offices have been digging into whether the New York-based bank has done enough to investigate the identities of risky clients, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The Federal Reserve was already known to be looking into those controls last year.\n\nThe inquiries focus on a wealth management arm that has swelled into Morgan Stanley\u2019s biggest business, generating almost half of the company\u2019s revenue last year. The US government has been ramping up pressure on the industry to tighten money-laundering controls as authorities make greater use of sanctions.\n\nThe bank has told regulators it\u2019s improving controls and procedures and met with Federal Reserve officials to allay concerns last year.\n\nChief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya added on the call that the international portion of its wealth business is small and there has been minimal impact from the focus on its client monitoring processes.\n\n\u201cThere are no strategic changes to our business,\u201d she said. \u201cNo changes in our ability to do business.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Paige Smith.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Specifically, equity underwriting income jumped 113% and fixed income underwriting income was up 37%. So, total IB fees (in the Institutional Securities division) grew 16% to $1.45 billion. We had projected it to be $1.26 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company also posted a decent trading performance. Equity trading revenues increased 4% year over year, while fixed-income trading income declined 4%.\r\n\r\nA provision benefit was another tailwind for Morgan Stanley.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite a 30% increase in interest income, the company\u2019s net interest income (NII) declined due to higher interest expenses. Also, an increase in total non-interest expenses was a headwind.\r\n\r\nNet income applicable to common shareholders (GAAP) was $3.27 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $2.69 billion.\n\nRevenues Improve, Expenses Rise\n\nQuarterly net revenues were $15.14 billion, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.47 billion.\r\n\r\nNII was $1.8 billion, down 23%. We had projected NII of $1.89 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest revenues of $13.34 billion increased 10%. Our estimate for the metric was $12.51 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal non-interest expenses were $10.74 billion, up 2%. Our estimate for expenses was $10.67 billion.\r\n\r\nProvision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million against a provision expense of $234 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nQuarterly Segment Performance\n\nInstitutional Securities: Pre-tax income was $2.35 billion, up 24% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same was $1.65 billion.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $7.02 billion, up 3% year over year. The upside resulted from increased underwriting revenues and equity trading revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.33 billion.\r\n\r\nWealth Management: Pre-tax income totaled $1.81 billion, up 5% year over year. Our estimate for this was the same as the reported number.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $6.88 billion, up 5%, driven by higher asset management revenues and transactional revenues. We had projected revenues of $6.82 billion.\r\n\r\nTotal client assets were $5.5 trillion as of Mar 31, 2024, up 21% year over year. We had projected the metric to be $5.03 trillion.\r\n\r\nInvestment Management: Pre-tax income was $241 million, jumping 45% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the same was $241.5 million.\r\n\r\nNet revenues were $1.38 billion, up 7%. The improvement is attributable to a rise in asset management and related fees. We had projected revenues of $1.4 billion.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, total assets under management or supervision were $1.51 trillion, up 10% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $1.47 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Position Solid\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, the book value per share was $55.60, up from $55.13 in the corresponding period of 2022. The tangible book value per share was $41.07, up from $40.68 as of Mar 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 17.2% compared with 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.3%, down from 15.6% a year ago.\n\nShare Repurchase Update\n\nIn the reported quarter, Morgan Stanley repurchased 12 million shares for $1 billion.\n\nOur View\n\nElevated expenses due to investments in franchises will likely continue to hurt MS\u2019 profits. Uncertainty about the performance of the capital markets makes us apprehensive. Yet, the company\u2019s increased focus on the wealth management business will likely keep aiding revenues.\n\nMorgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Morgan Stanley Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMorgan Stanley price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Morgan Stanley Quote\n\nCurrently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPerformance of Other Banks\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\u2019s GS first-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $11.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.54. Also, the bottom line increased 16.3% from the year-earlier quarter.\r\n\r\nGoldman\u2019s results have benefited from the strength in the consumer banking and investment banking businesses, along with improved fee income. However, increased expenses and provisions were the undermining factors.\r\n\r\nCitigroup\u2019s C first-quarter 2024 net income from continuing operations per share of $1.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. However, the metric declined 28% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nCitigroup witnessed declines in total loans and deposits in the quarter. Also, a decrease in revenues and deteriorating credit quality are near-term woes.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Top Estimates",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.70 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $1.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of 7.62%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nMorgan Stanley , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $15.14 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.60%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $14.52 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMorgan Stanley shares have lost about 6.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Morgan Stanley?\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Morgan Stanley: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.61 on $14.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.36 on $56.88 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial - Investment Bank is currently in the top 16% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nPiper Sandler Companies (PIPR), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on April 26.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nPiper Sandler Companies' revenues are expected to be $306.96 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analysts had expected net income to fall and net revenue to be flat.\n\nIts investment banking and trading also exceeded what analysts predicted.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley\u2019s traders delivered first-quarter revenue that exceeded expectations as its wealth management juggernaut also got back on track \u2014 both handing a key win for its new leader Ted Pick.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBeyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Iran\u2019s Attack on Israel Sparks Race to Avert a Full-Blown War S&P 500 Futures Steady After Selloff Rattles Globe: Markets Wrap Microsoft Invests $1.5 Billion in UAE\u2019s G42 in Pivot From China\n\nRevenue from the trading business came in at $$5.33 billion, cruising past analyst estimates and following the blowout earnings from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders.\n\nThe wealth unit generated $6.88 billion in revenue, higher than analysts\u2019 expectations. Net new assets in the division, a key metric tracked by Morgan Stanley watchers, were $95 billion, higher than the previous two quarters combined and in excess of what the bank needs to meet the target it has sought to grow the business.\n\nPick, who took the helm in January, is confronting the challenge of convincing investors he can advance the growth pace set by his predecessor, revive fortunes at the investment bank he oversaw and accelerate the expansion of its wealth-management behemoth. While the money-management business has grown steadily, executives are eager to capitalize on a reopening of capital markets that could spell more deals, trades and capital-raising business.\n\nThe bank\u2019s stock has been the worst performer among the biggest US banks so far this year after outpacing rivals through much of the previous decade. Earnings for the quarter totaled $3.4 billion on $15.1 billion in revenue.\n\n\u201cAs a result of strong net new asset growth, the firm has reached $7 trillion of client assets across wealth and investment management,\u201d Pick said in a statement.\n\nThe bank\u2019s shares were up about 2.7% to $89.35 at 7:52 a.m. in early New York trading. Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock is down 6.7% so far this year, bucking gains across the banking sector especially among its biggest peers.\n\nThe stock took a dive last week after a report in the Wall Street Journal that a cadre of US regulators are scrutinizing the firm\u2019s efforts to prevent potential money laundering by wealthy clients. Investors have also been analyzing its ability to meet its ambitious target to attract new assets into its wealth unit and deliver promising pre-tax margins of as much as 30%.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s fixed-income trading business posted $2.49 billion in revenue, compared with estimates of $2.33 billion. In equities, revenue totaled $2.84 billion. In that business, the New York-based firm has lost the crown to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. whose equities haul totaled $3.31 billion in the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nFees from advising on deals came in at $461 million, compared with estimates of $510 million. Equity-underwriting revenue rose to $430 million as the return of public listings and secondary offerings raised banker hopes for a reopening of those markets.\n\nDespite advisory revenue falling behind its chief rivals, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya pointed to the bank\u2019s prominent standing in recently announced deals.\n\n\u201cBacklogs are building and we\u2019re seeing sponsor activity pick up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a great position.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Financial, statistical and business-related information, as well as information regarding business and segment trends, is included in the financial supplement. Both the earnings release and the financial supplement are available online in the Investor Relations section at www.morganstanley.com.\n\nNOTICE:\n\nThe information provided herein and in the financial supplement, including information provided on the Firm\u2019s earnings conference calls, may include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of such measures or reconciliation of such measures to the comparable U.S. GAAP figures are included in this earnings release and the financial supplement, both of which are available on www.morganstanley.com.\n\nThis earnings release may contain forward-looking statements, including the attainment of certain financial and other targets, objectives and goals. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, which reflect management\u2019s current estimates, projections, expectations, assumptions, interpretations or beliefs and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the Firm, please see \"Forward-Looking Statements\" preceding Part I, Item 1, \"Competition\" and \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1, \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A, \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 and \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk\" in Part II, Item 7A in the Firm\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other items throughout the Form 10-K, the Firm\u2019s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Firm\u2019s Current Reports on Form 8-K, including any amendments thereto.\n\n1 Includes preferred dividends related to the calculation of earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 of approximately $146 million and $144 million, respectively.\n\n2 The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain \"non-GAAP financial measures\" in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\n\n3 Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results.\n\n4 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents full year or annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents tangible common shareholder\u2019s equity divided by common shares outstanding.\n\n5 \"DCP\" refers to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation programs. Please refer to \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Other Matters \u2013 Deferred Cash-Based Compensation\" in the Firm\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n6 Pre-tax income represents income before provision for income taxes.\n\n7 Pre-tax margin represents income before provision for income taxes divided by net revenues.\n\n8 The expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues.\n\n9 Wealth Management fee-based client assets represent the amount of assets in client accounts where the basis of payment for services is a fee calculated on those assets.\n\n10 Wealth Management fee-based asset flows include net new fee-based assets (including asset acquisitions), net account transfers, dividends, interest, and client fees, and exclude institutional cash management related activity.\n\n11 Wealth Management net new assets represent client asset inflows, inclusive of interest, dividends and asset acquisitions, less client asset outflows, and exclude the impact of business combinations/divestitures and the impact of fees and commissions.\n\n12 AUM is defined as assets under management or supervision.\n\n13 Long-term net flows include the Equity, Fixed Income and Alternative and Solutions asset classes and excludes the Liquidity and Overlay Services asset class.\n\n14 Following the failures of certain banks and resulting losses to the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund in the first half of 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule on November, 16 2023 to implement a special assessment to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors. We recorded the cost of the special assessment of $286 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. We recorded an additional estimated cost of $42 million during the current quarter based on the February notification received from the FDIC which contained revised estimated losses as well as the estimated recoveries from its receivership residual interest from those bank failures.\n\n15 Transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fee revenues.\n\n16 Capital ratios are estimates as of the press release date, April 16, 2024.\n\n17 CET1 capital is defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The Firm\u2019s risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk\u2010weighted assets (RWAs) (the \"Standardized Approach\") and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the \"Advanced Approach\"). For information on the calculation of regulatory capital and ratios, and associated regulatory requirements, please refer to \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Liquidity and Capital Resources \u2013 Regulatory Requirements\" in the Firm\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n18 The Tier 1 leverage ratio is a leverage-based capital requirement that measures the Firm\u2019s leverage. Tier 1 leverage ratio utilizes Tier 1 capital as the numerator and average adjusted assets as the denominator.\n\n19 The Firm\u2019s supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) utilizes a Tier 1 capital numerator of approximately $79.1 billion and $77.9 billion, and supplementary leverage exposure denominator of approximately $1.46 trillion and $1.42 trillion, for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nMorgan Stanley Consolidated Income Statement Information (unaudited, dollars in millions) Quarter Ended Percentage Change From: Mar 31, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Mar 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2023 Mar 31, 2023 Revenues: Investment banking $ 1,589 $ 1,415 $ 1,330 12 % 19 % Trading 4,852 3,305 4,477 47 % 8 % Investments 137 189 145 (28 %) (6 %) Commissions and fees 1,227 1,110 1,239 11 % (1 %) Asset management 5,269 5,041 4,728 5 % 11 % Other 266 (61 ) 252 * 6 % Total non-interest revenues 13,340 10,999 12,171 21 % 10 % Interest income 12,930 12,830 9,980 1 % 30 % Interest expense 11,134 10,933 7,634 2 % 46 % Net interest 1,796 1,897 2,346 (5 %) (23 %) Net revenues 15,136 12,896 14,517 17 % 4 % Provision for credit losses (6 ) 3 234 * * Non-interest expenses: Compensation and benefits 6,696 5,951 6,410 13 % 4 % Non-compensation expenses: Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees 921 865 881 6 % 5 % Information processing and communications 976 987 915 (1 %) 7 % Professional services 639 822 710 (22 %) (10 %) Occupancy and equipment 441 528 440 (16 %) -- Marketing and business development 217 224 247 (3 %) (12 %) Other 857 1,420 920 (40 %) (7 %) Total non-compensation expenses 4,051 4,846 4,113 (16 %) (2 %) Total non-interest expenses 10,747 10,797 10,523 -- 2 % Income before provision for income taxes 4,395 2,096 3,760 110 % 17 % Provision for income taxes 933 555 727 68 % 28 % Net income $ 3,462 $ 1,541 $ 3,033 125 % 14 % Net income applicable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests 50 24 53 108 % (6 %) Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley 3,412 1,517 2,980 125 % 14 % Preferred stock dividend 146 134 144 9 % 1 % Earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders $ 3,266 $ 1,383 $ 2,836 136 % 15 % __________________________\n\nNotes: - In the first quarter of 2024, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes that impacted interest income and interest expense but had no effect on net interest income. These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related customer receivables and payables that are currently accounted for as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The current and previous presentation of these interest income and interest expense amounts are acceptable and the change does not represent a change in accounting principle. These changes were applied retrospectively to the income statement in 2023 and accordingly, prior period amounts were adjusted to conform with the current presentation. - Firm net revenues excluding mark-to-market gains and losses on deferred cash-based compensation plans (DCP) were: 1Q24: $14,949 million, 4Q23: $12,527 million, 1Q23: $14,364 million. - Firm compensation expenses excluding DCP were: 1Q24: $6,447 million, 4Q23: $5,597 million, 1Q23: $6,217 million. - The End Notes are an integral part of this presentation.

        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Morgan Stanley Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is set to release earnings results for its first quarter, before the opening bell on April 16, 2024.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, analysts expect the New York-based bank to report quarterly earnings at $1.66 per share, up from $1.55 per share in the year-ago quarter; and quarterly revenue of $14.41 billion, compared to $13.92 billion in the year-earlier period.\n\nOn April 9, JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan reiterated Morgan Stanley with a Market Perform rating.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Morgan Stanley, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends. As of now, Morgan Stanley has a dividend yield of 3.94%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 85 cents a share ($3.40 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Morgan Stanley, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Morgan Stanley\u2019s $3.40 dividend: $6,000 / $3.40 = 1,765 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $152,125 worth of Morgan Stanley, or 1,765 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $3.40 = 353 shares, or $30,425 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on MS\n\nAlso Read: Jim Cramer Says WESCO International Is A Buy, Recommends Buying This Stock Under $20\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nMS Price Action: Shares of Morgan Stanley fell 0.8% to close at $86.19 on Friday.\n\nRead More: Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab And 3 Stocks To Watch Heading Into Monday\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Morgan Stanley Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "IB to Aid Morgan Stanley (MS) Q1 Earnings, Trading to Hurt",
        "content": "The performance of Morgan Stanley\u2019s MS trading business (constituting a significant portion of its top line) is not expected to have been impressive in the first quarter of 2024, due to lower market volatility. Thus, the company\u2019s trading numbers are not likely to have provided much support to its quarterly results, slated to be announced before the opening bell on Apr 16.\r\n\r\nClient activity was decent in the quarter. The expectations of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, a gradually cooling inflation and clarity on the Fed rate path drove client activity. However, volatility was low in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.63 billion, indicating a decline of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $2.28 billion indicates a year-over-year decline of 11.6%.\r\n\r\nOur estimates for first-quarter equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are pegged at $2.76 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively.\n\nOther Key Factors at Play\n\nInvestment Banking (IB) Income: Following weakness in 2022 and 2023, global mergers and acquisitions bounced back in the first quarter of 2024. Both deal value and volumes witnessed a noteworthy comeback driven by solid financial performances, fading recession risks, buoyant markets and expected rate cuts this year. However, tough scrutiny by antitrust regulators and lingering geopolitical tensions continued to be concerns.\r\n\r\nWhile Morgan Stanley\u2019s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have provided some leverage, overall growth in advisory fees is not expected to have been impressive in the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $533 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 16.5%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $626.4 million, indicating a 1.8% dip.\r\n\r\n The IPO market activity was decent in the first quarter on the back of robust equity market performance. This also drove some activity in follow-up equity issuances. Bond issuance volumes were bolstered by lower yields and a better operating backdrop compared with the last year. Hence, Morgan Stanley\u2019s underwriting fees are expected to have improved somewhat in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $484 million, suggesting a rise of 18.9% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $258 million indicates an increase of 27.7%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $742 million implies a rise of 21.8% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $416.9 million while equity underwriting fees is expected to be $216.7 million.\r\n\r\nGrowth in total IB income is likely to have been decent due to the expected rise in underwriting revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.28 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 2.2%. Our estimate for IB income is pegged at $1.26 billion.\r\n\r\nNet Interest Income (NII): Given some clarity on the Fed\u2019s interest rate path for the year and high chances of a soft landing of the U.S. economy, the lending scenario improved marginally in the first quarter. Per the Fed\u2019s latest data, while the demand for commercial and industrial loans was relatively weak, the demand for real estate and consumer loans was decent in the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Fed kept interest rates unchanged in the first quarter at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. However, despite decent loan growth and high rates, Morgan Stanley\u2019s NII is not expected to have improved much because of the inverted yield curve and higher funding costs.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $1.87 billion, suggesting a decline of 20.5% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $1.89 billion, implying a decline of 19.4%.\r\n\r\nOn a sequential basis, management expects NII in the first quarter of 2024 to be relatively stable.\r\n\r\nExpenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the March-ended quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have flared.\r\n\r\nWe expect first-quarter total non-interest expenses of $10.67 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 1.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts\n\nAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it doesn\u2019t have the right combination of the two key ingredients \u2014 a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better \u2014 to increase the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is -0.13%.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings has remained unchanged at $1.69 per share over the past seven days. The estimate implies a 0.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $14.47 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 0.3%.\n\nMorgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMorgan Stanley price-eps-surprise | Morgan Stanley Quote\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nPer our model, a couple of finance stocks, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this reporting cycle are PNC Financial PNC and Truist Financial TFC.\r\n\r\nThe Earnings ESP for PNC is +0.45%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 16.\r\n\r\nTFC is scheduled to release first-quarter 2024 earnings on Apr 22.

        "title": "Profits surge at Goldman Sachs on Wall Street revival",
        "content": "Profits at Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 28% in the first quarter as investment banking revenues surged, giving CEO David Solomon some needed momentum at the start of 2024.\n\nNet income was $4.1 billion, beating analyst expectations. Its revenues of $14.2 billion were also up from a year ago thanks in part to a 32% rise in investment banking fees. Asset and wealth management revenues rose, as did trading.\n\nGoldman's stock rose 3% in premarket trading Monday.\n\nThe improved results follow a year that was the most challenging for Solomon since 2019, his first full year in charge.\n\nDealmaking slowed across Wall Street and he grappled with a costly exit from consumer banking and a series of high-profile departures from the firm. Goldman CEO David Solomon. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe pressure on Solomon hasn\u2019t let up in 2024. Two prominent proxy advisory firms are advising stockholders to cast votes this month that would limit the power of Solomon, with results due to be tallied at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 24.\n\nThe proposal that garnered a stamp of approval from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co. would split the CEO and chairman roles, both currently occupied by Solomon. A similar proposal last year did not pass, winning only 16% of votes.\n\nGlass Lewis is separately suggesting that stockholders also vote against Goldman\u2019s executive pay plan due to a \"significant disconnect between pay and performance.\" ISS provided \"cautionary support\" for the executive pay plan.\n\nSolomon\u2019s 2023 compensation rose 24% \u2014 to $31 million \u2014 despite a profit decline of the same amount.\n\nNot only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan, Charles Scharf, and Jane Fraser made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C).\n\nOnly JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance.\n\nA lot is in flux at Goldman as key executives depart, raising new questions about the race to eventually succeed Solomon.\n\nOne surprise exit in 2024 is Jim Esposito, who had been co-head of Goldman\u2019s global banking and markets division and is leaving after nearly three decades. Esposito had been viewed on Wall Street as among the possible successors to Solomon.\n\nAnother recent departure in March was Stephanie Cohen, global head of its platform solutions division.\n\nEven the board of Goldman is changing. This year, ex-Goldman CFO David Viniar was appointed as the board\u2019s lead director to replace Adebayo Ogunlesi, who announced he would step down after selling his infrastructure investment company to BlackRock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first quarter results could help Solomon as he prepares to face shareholders later this month. The surge in investment banking included a 24% rise in advisory fees, a 38% jump in debt underwriting and a 45% increase in equity underwriting fees.\n\nTrading revenues from fixed income and equities were also both up 10% from a year ago.\n\n\"Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of Goldman Sachs,\" Solomon said in a press release.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley Hires Huang for China Asset Management Drive",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley hired former Credit Suisse banker Min Huang to lead its China investment management division as the US firm recalibrates its mutual fund business and expands its product offerings in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Versus Iran \u2014 What All-Out War Could Look Like Texas Warns of Possible Power Emergency Next Week Iran\u2019s Missile Barrage Was an Error Israel Can Gain From Apple\u2019s iPhone Shipments Drop 10% as Android Rivals Rise Israel Grapples With New Phase in Its Multi-Front War With Iran\n\nHuang, most recently China head of client coverage for UBS Asset Management, will focus on attracting funds from high net worth and institutional investors, according to an internal memo last week that was confirmed by a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been overhauling its money management business in China after attaining full ownership of a joint venture with its local partner last year. The New York-based bank hired Michael Levin from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to head the unit for Asia, while adding Alex Zhou, formerly with United MetLife Insurance Co. in Shanghai, as chief investment officer. The bank also reorganized the China operation, letting go more than a dozen local staff.\n\nLevin spent more than a decade at Credit Suisse and overlapped with Huang, who had a more than 18-year stint at the Swiss bank in Hong Kong. Part of Huang\u2019s mandate is to expand the business through so-called qualified domestic limited partnerships. These allow foreign and local asset managers to raise money in Chinese currency to invest in overseas products ranging from stocks and bonds to alternative investments like private equity and hedge funds.\n\nGlobal companies are making headway in China\u2019s 27 trillion yuan ($3.7 trillion) mutual fund market after regulators quickened approvals, increasing the number of wholly foreign-owned operators. JPMorgan Chase & Co. got regulatory approval for full control of its joint venture in January last year, two months after Manulife Financial Corp. became the first foreign firm to win 100% ownership through an acquisition. Other companies that have similar operations include Fidelity International Ltd., Neuberger Berman Group and BlackRock Inc.\n\nRead more: Credit Suisse Names Min Huang as APAC Head of Asset Management\n\nBased in Hong Kong, Huang will have responsibilities across Morgan Stanley investment management business platforms and distribution in Greater China, according to the memo.

        "title": "10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most undervalued value stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and undervalued stocks, then you can check out 5 Most Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAmong the several categories that stocks can be divided into, two categories are value stocks and growth stocks. They stand on the opposite end of the spectrum and cater to investors with different kinds of risk appetite and goals. These stocks are defined primarily through the price to earnings ratio, which measures the premium that the stock market is paying over the firm's ability to make a profit. The higher the ratio is, the more a stock can be said to be a 'growth' stock and vice versa, with the industry in which the value stock or growth stock belongs also playing a crucial role as different sectors often have wildly varying P/E ratios.\n\nInvestors who pile into growth stocks do so to grow their money. A stock with a high P/E ratio shows that the market believes that it will grow its earnings significantly in the future and is therefore willing to bet on this future growth in the present. On the flip side, value stocks are for those investors who just want to place their money in a stable security and just forget about it. As opposed to growth stocks, whose high P/E ratio comes with the risk of significant share price drop in case of an untoward event, value stocks are relatively insulated since investors have not paid a hefty premium over their earnings. One exception to this statement is value traps which are stocks with strong current earnings but negative earnings growth rates. Value traps may look cheap but investors face significant capital destruction risk.\n\nThis fundamental difference between value stocks and growth stocks is most often based on their business models. So say, one example of a value stock, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), is unlikely to be perceived by investors to leave a blazing trail in its wake of pursuing high technology innovation. On the flip side, investors of the eCommerce behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), rightly have high expectations from the firm when it comes to maintaining a foothold (or stronghold) in the high growth eCommerce market and artificial intelligence. This is also reflected in Amazon's forward and trailing P/E ratios which currently sit at 43.67 and 63.82, respectively. For more on growth stocks, you can check out 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother set of categories that stocks can be divided into are undervalued and overvalued stocks. In fact, stock valuation sits at the heart of an investing philosophy called Value Investing. This set of beliefs has found some highly successful adherents on Wall Street, with two notable ones being Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. At its heart, value investing involves determining the fair or true value of a stock and then comparing it with the market price. If the market price is lower, then an investing decision is made depending on the difference between the two called the margin of safety. The greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels with their decision as it reduces the amount of losses in case of the share price dropping in an untoward event. Stocks that have a fair value that is higher than the market value are called undervalued stocks, and those whose market price is higher are called overvalued stocks - with the market price being the primary determinant of the valuation adjective.\n\nThe next question to ask is, what constitutes a fair value of a stock? Well, one commonly used proxy for this is the analyst share price targets. Sell side financial firms such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) employ analysts whose sole job is to see what the value of a firm's stock can be based on different metrics such as future cash flows. Averaging these price targets aims to remove some of the biases present in a single analyst's analysis and it is often used as a proxy for fair value.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the most undervalued value stocks, we can check to see if investing in undervalued stocks has its merits or not. Well, we don't have to look too far to find a list of undervalued stocks. One such list is Insider Monkey's coverage of 14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now. This list used consensus undervalued stock picks of the financial media and was published in mid September 2023. The average six month share price performance of all the stocks on this list is 19.64% and ranges from 44.64% for Amazon to -22.77% for the lithium provider Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).\n\nAlbermarle has suffered amidst a glut in the global lithium industry that has been hurt from oversupply and slow demand, and here's what The London Company had to say about the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nALB underperformed as weak lithium prices drove downward revisions to earnings expectations, and sentiment became more negative regarding demand for electric vehicles. Commodity prices are inherently uncertain, but we continue to view ALB as a winner in this growing industry and favorably positioned on the cost curve. Our long-term view of ALB is not affected by short-term supply-demand dynamics for the commodity.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most undervalued value stocks that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG). 10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued value stocks we first made a list of 40 stocks with P/E ratios under 15 and average analyst percentage share price upside greater than 20%. Then, the 20 stocks with the highest upside were selected, and they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top stocks were selected.\n\nFor these undervalued value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now\n\n10.

        "title": "Coupang Stock (NYSE:CPNG): Should You Ride This Rocket Higher?",
        "content": "Maybe you\u2019ve seen the trending stock tickers today and noticed that Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock was on a rocket ride higher. There\u2019s nothing wrong with momentum, but investors should look into the reason for the move and make their own decisions. I am bearish on CPNG stock, and as we delve into what\u2019s actually going on with Coupang, you might decide to find better investment opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Coupang is as South Korea\u2019s version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It\u2019s a popular e-commerce company with an order-fulfillment service called Rocket Delivery.\n\nCPNG stock was on the move today, and you may be tempted to go all-in on the South Korean Amazon. However, be sure to learn all of the relevant facts before making any investment decisions. After all, a stock can be vulnerable to a pullback if a rally isn\u2019t really justified.\n\nA Bigger Company Could Threaten Coupang\n\nBefore we get into the headline news, there\u2019s a development that prospective Coupang investors can\u2019t afford to ignore. Specifically, a huge company is reportedly taking steps to compete directly with Coupang.\n\nThis company is much bigger than Coupang \u2014 and no, it\u2019s not Amazon. Rather, it\u2019s China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which has a $184.13 billion market cap, as opposed to Coupang\u2019s $38.16 billion market cap.\n\nHere\u2019s the scoop, courtesy of Nikkei\u2019s Kotaro Hosokawa (via TheFly). Apparently, Alibaba plans to invest $1.1 billion \u201cover the next three years to create a logistics network in South Korea.\u201d With this move, Alibaba intends to take on Coupang \u201cby leveraging low prices and speedy deliveries.\u201d\n\nFor an e-commerce business, being threatened by Alibaba in Asia would be like being threatened by Amazon in the U.S. It\u2019s just bad news for Coupang.\n\nFurthermore, Alibaba has the capital resources to cause problems for Coupang. Reportedly, Alibaba will build a logistics center in a 180,000-square-meter lot this year, as well as a call center with 300 employees. Plus, Alibaba plans to establish a \u201cpurchasing department to sell local products overseas, aiming to boost exports for 50,000 small South Korean businesses over three years.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the market is simply ignoring this news, as short-term traders are obsessing over a new development with Coupang. Still, big-picture thinkers shouldn\u2019t just dismiss the threat that Alibaba will pose to Coupang in the coming years.\n\nWhy Was Coupang Stock Up 11.5% Today?\n\nSo, here\u2019s the catalyst that caused CPNG stock to rally 11.5% today. As The Korea Times reported, Coupang plans to increase its monthly Wow service (which is similar to Amazon\u2019s Prime service) membership fee from 4,990 South Korean won previously to a new price of 7,890 won (equivalent to approximately $5.74).\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, bear in mind that $5.74 can be a lot of money for families in different regions of the world. Moreover, this is a 58% increase in the monthly Wow service fee.\n\nSurely, Coupang\u2019s customers are now saying \u201cwow\u201d to the \u201cWow\u201d service, but not in a good way. This probably should go without saying, but The Korea Times stated, \u201cMany consumers [are] displeased with [the] steep price hike.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s put this into perspective. Without a doubt, some customers haven\u2019t been particularly happy about Amazon\u2019s Prime membership price hikes throughout the years. However, at least Amazon had the sense to make those price increases somewhat gradual \u2014 not 58% all at once.\n\nMy point is that this could backfire in a big way. In the immediate term, stock traders are probably over-focused on the revenue-generating potential of Coupang\u2019s Wow service price hike. If the company loses angry customers, though, then there could be long-term damage to Coupang\u2019s bottom line. That\u2019s the last thing Coupang needs as Alibaba makes major moves to steal some of the company\u2019s market share in South Korea.\n\nIs Coupang Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CPNG comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\u00a0three Buys and two Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average CPNG stock price target is $21.75, implying 2.35% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CPNG stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Seyon Park of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with an average return of 16.1% per rating and an 89% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Coupang Stock?\n\nCoupang\u00a0is certainly an intriguing company that might be compared to Amazon. Yet, even the mammoth Amazon didn\u2019t have the audacity to raise its subscription service fee by 58% all at once. Truly, Coupang\u2019s huge price hike is either a brilliant move or just reckless and greedy.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t consider it to be a brilliant move. Coupang needs to keep its customers happy, especially with Alibaba threatening to make a move into Coupang\u2019s home turf. Consequently, even though\u00a0CPNG stock is quickly moving higher, I\u2019m not considering owning it now.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) closed the latest trading day at $86.19, indicating a -0.75% change from the previous session's end. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.46%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.24%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.63%.\n\nShares of the investment bank have depreciated by 2.54% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Finance sector's loss of 3.74% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 1.6%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Morgan Stanley in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on April 16, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.69, reflecting a 0.59% decrease from the same quarter last year.

        "title": "3 Utility Stocks Short Sellers Are Pulling the Plug On: Is a Power Outage Looming?",
        "content": "One of the best ideas for surviving market ambiguity is to focus on utility stocks. Since the enterprises underlying this category benefit from a natural monopoly, they effectively command permanent relevance. Still, even this ecosystem can become a short-seller target.\n\nOrdinarily, you wouldn\u2019t look for short trades in the regulated power and resource space. Nevertheless, not all regions enjoy the same level of economic viability or resilience. Further, certain regions may suffer from unique headwinds that don\u2019t impact other markets.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated narrative. However, with analysts dumping these utility stocks combined with their status as short-seller targets, these are the ideas you may want to avoid.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAvista (AVA) multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skyline. AQN stock\n\nSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Spokane, Washington, Avista (NYSE:AVA) operates as an electric and natural gas utility company. It provides electric distribution and transmission along with natural gas distribution services in parts of eastern Washington and northern Idaho. On paper, it sounds relevant. However, it happens to be one of the utility stocks that are short-seller targets.\n\nConspicuously, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate sell. The assessment breaks down as one Hold and one Sell. Further, the average price target sits at $33, implying more than 3% downside risk. Yes, the company overall enjoyed a strong performance in fiscal 2023. Its average positive earnings surprise came out to 7.8%.\n\nHowever, experts are looking for revenue to slip 3.9% to $1.68 billion. Further, fiscal 2025\u2019s projected revenue of $1.78 billion is only marginally better than last year\u2019s haul of $1.75 billion.\n\nData from Fintel indicates that AVA features a short interest of float of nearly 4% with a short ratio of 7.02 days to cover. Combined with the aforementioned Sell rating, AVA might be one of the utility stocks to avoid.\n\nMGE Energy (MGEE) Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit up\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, MGE Energy (NASDAQ:MGEE) operates as a public utility holding company mainly in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, MGE generates, purchases and distributes electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and Iowa. It also owns and leases electric generating capacity and plans, constructs, operates, maintains and expands transmission facilities to provide transmission power services.\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s like most other relevant utility stocks: MGE gets the job done for its customers, which number around 163,000. However, Morgan Stanley\u2019s (NYSE:MS) David Arcaro isn\u2019t keen on the idea, pegging MGEE a Sell. In addition, the expert has assigned a $64 price target on shares, implying more than 15% downside risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of the disillusionment could stem from the erratic earnings performance last year. Back then, the average quarterly surprise came out to 3.08% below consensus expectations.\n\nAdding to the pressure, MGEE represents one of the short-seller targets. Currently, its short interest comes in at 5.78% of the float. As well, the short ratio stands at 14.94 days to cover. Risk-averse investors may want to consider something else.\n\nHawaiian Electric (HE) graphic of magnifying glass zooming in on Hawaiian Electric Industries (HE) webpage\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Casimiro PT\n\nThe island state of Hawaii is often considered a top destination spot for vacationing. However, its utility stocks don\u2019t necessarily get the same love. Just look at Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE). With its subsidiaries, the company engages in the electric utility business. It provides production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai.\n\nHowever, Hawaii depends greatly on tourism. With consumer discretionary sentiment under pressure from inflation and other headwinds, this narrative faces some questions. Sadly, the wildfires in the state devastated tourism, leading to a catastrophic loss of equity value in HE stock. Year-to-date, it\u2019s down 24%. Over the past 52 weeks, it slipped more than 72%.\n\nNow, there is an argument that Hawaiian Electric could make a comeback. That\u2019s up to you. The fact of the matter is that analysts rate shares a Moderate Sell with an average price target of $9.75. That implies almost 10% downside risk.\n\nFurther, HE suffers from a short interest of 14.64% and a short ratio of 8.03 days to cover. Again, it\u2019s your call if you want to speculate. However, it is an extremely risky idea.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "High interest rates are getting more challenging for even the biggest banks",
        "content": "A key revenue source for three giant banks fell during the first three months of the year, showing that even the biggest financial institutions are struggling with the same challenges facing the rest of the industry as interest rates remain elevated.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) all said Friday that their net interest income dropped from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. It was down 4% at JPMorgan, 4% at Wells Fargo, and 2% at Citigroup.\n\nNet interest income is a critical measure for many banks, since it measures the difference between what banks earn on their assets and pay out on their deposits.\n\nSmaller banks have struggled to boost this measure over the last year as interest rates and deposit costs soared. Now there are some signs in the first quarter that high rates are starting to weigh on growth even at the nation\u2019s largest lenders. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan said in a press release that its net interest income dropped due to \"deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances.\"\n\nDepositors are seeking out higher yields, as they have at smaller banks, and moving their money into products such as certificates of deposits where JPMorgan has to pay a higher rate.\n\n\"As customers move out of checking and savings, they may choose to go into CDs,\u201d CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters Friday in response to a question from Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat means that the bank is paying more for the internal migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the sort of deposits migration that we\u2019re expecting\u201d for the rest of 2024, he added.\n\nIt is certainly still true that the big banks are better positioned than their rivals to withstand a period of elevated interest rates and that they will still be able to earn plenty of money from lending.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s net interest income in the first quarter, for example, was $1 billion higher than expected, and JPMorgan did boost an estimate of net interest income for all of 2024 to $89 billion, excluding trading, up from a previous estimate of $88 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that was flat when compared to 2023. JPMorgan\u2019s stock dropped by more than 5% Friday as investors absorbed the news.\n\nOverall profits for JPMorgan were still up by 6% from a year ago, to $13.4 billion, beating Wall Street expectations.\n\n'We are a little bit cautious'\n\nBoth Wells Fargo and Citigroup disclosed they are also paying more for their deposits.\n\nWells Fargo's average deposit cost was 1.74%, which was higher than 1.58% in the fourth quarter and 0.83% in the year-ago period. Its overall profits dropped 7% from a year earlier.\n\nAt Citigroup, its average rate paid on deposits rose to 3.70%, up from 3.61% from the previous quarter and 2.72% from the year-ago period. Its overall profits dropped 27% from a year earlier.\n\nCitigroup also provided some updates about an ambitious restructuring of the bank that is resulting in thousands of job losses. It said it eliminated 7,000 positions as part of a target of reducing headcount by 20,000 by 2026.\n\nThe stocks of Wells Fargo and Citigroup were both flat Friday.\n\nThere were also a number of positives in the banks' results Friday. JPMorgan set aside less money for future loan losses and investment banking fees jumped 21% to $2 billion, a sign that a Wall Street revival may be underway.\n\nBut most of that came from debt underwriting, as opposed to advisory work.\n\n\"We are a little bit cautious,\" Barnum said about any pickup in M&A activity.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s boss, Jamie Dimon, also offered more warnings about the road ahead for the US economy, repeating a theme he hammered home in his annual shareholder letter released earlier in the week.\n\n\"Many economic indicators continue to be favorable,\" Dimon said. \"However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces.\"\n\nHe cited wars and geopolitical tensions, \"persistent inflationary pressures\" that \"may likely continue,\" and a campaign of quantitative tightening from the Federal Reserve.\n\nDimon has said he is prepared for rates to go as high as 8%. When asked by Yahoo Finance on Friday about the prospect of rates remaining higher for longer, he said \"rates being higher on their own isn't that important, what is important is why.\"\n\n\"If it is because of stagflation that's obviously negative. If it\u2019s because of, you know, healthy growth, that's actually pretty good.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best high volume stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nWith the first quarter of 2024 firmly behind us, the second quarter is seeing the return of the bulls vs bears that we grew accustomed to last year. Before artificial intelligence took the market by storm, investors and analysts were pulling their hair out as they analyzed and tried to guess the future of the American economy. Back then, inflation was much sharper than it is now, and as stock market investors were still coming to terms with rapid interest rate hikes, they were uncertain about what lay ahead in America's economic future and how they should position their portfolios.\n\nNow, these same trends are raising their heads in the second quarter of 2024. While investors' thirst for rapid stock market percentage gains was quenched with artificial intelligence, stocks nevertheless paired back their gains in April after the latest set of inflation data hit the news wires. This data showed that the consumer price index, one of the economy's inflation indicators, rose by 0.4% in March and 3.5%, slightly outpacing earlier estimates. The annual growth ended up being the fastest in six month, and while the data wasn't even remotely as striking as the peak inflation readings of 2022, it nevertheless shattered some hopes of a respite from the Federal Reserve in the form of early interest rate reductions.\n\nThe aftermath of this data led to widespread implications. High volume stocks are those that are trading above their average reading and they can indicate several things. For our latest set of macroeconomic data, such volume stocks can indicate investor sentiment about those firms that do not stand to benefit from rates being higher for longer. The data's implication for the stock market saw stocks naturally tumble as inflation ended up beating expectations for the third consecutive month. The impact on the market was bifurcated across sectors, as while the S&P 500 fell by 1%, the index's real estate sector was sharply hit as the stocks fell by 4%. The technology dominated NASDAQ 100 and NASDAQ Composite were down by 1% as well, and other sectors that outpaced the broader stock market indexes include small cap stocks and utilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading stocks based on their volume is part of a toolkit dubbed technical trading. This sees investors focus on purely market based indicators such as share price movements, averages, and volatility. Courtesy of the copious amounts of data that are available to the everyday investor, finding stock volumes simply requires following a screener. Current volumes, i.e. the number of shares that are trading hands at the moment are compared to average historical volumes to see if anything is out of the ordinary.\n\nStocks with high trading volumes can see investor interest for a variety of reasons. In the aftermath of the latest inflation data, this was somewhat visible as well. For instance, roughly two hours before markets closed on the day of the data release, shares of the mega retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) gained roughly 90 basis points. Their average volume at the time was 8.1 million, which was less than half of the average volume of 19 million. This trend was also visible in the shares of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), with the 1.2 million shares trading hands less than half the average volume of 3.8 million. On the flip side, roughly 2.8 million Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) were trading hands, which was almost in line with the historical volume of 3.1 million. Shares of another real estate company, Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) painted a similar picture with the current trading volume being 75% of the historic trading volume.\n\nWhat these facts make clear is that broader market news such as inflation data tends to cause volume spikes in some sectors and leaves other sectors alone. As for real estate, here's what Third Avenue Management had to say about the high volume stock Prologis in its fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter:\n\nPrologis (a U.S.-based Industrial and Logistics REIT) held a capital markets forum, where the management team reviewed the evolution of the business and highlighted their \u201ccustomer focus\u201d. The team also covered several material value-drivers, including: (i) the \u201closs-to-lease\u201d opportunity within the existing portfolio with market rents approximately 60% above in-place leases, thus representing nearly $3.0 billion of incremental cash flow3 that can be realized as leases renew, (ii) a 12k acre landbank that can accommodate more than 200 million square feet of additional properties, which is increasingly being used to deliver datacenters given the higher capital values relative to industrial properties, and (iii) its Essentials segment, including the addition of rooftop solar panels at many facilities, which currently account for 555 Megawatts (\u201cMW\u201d) of installed capacity (and generates $40 million of operating profits) but is expected to comprise 7000 MW of capacity by 2030 (and generate approximately $800 mm of annual profits).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the high volume stocks that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable names are Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nAn experienced day trader at a modern trading workstation, looking intently at changing stock prices and reviewing portfolios.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best high volume stocks, we ranked the 40 stocks with the highest three month trading volume by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.\n\nFor these best high volume stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "3 Obesity Drug Stocks Set to Skyrocket as Demand Goes Wild",
        "content": "The burgeoning interest in obesity drugs, particularly GLP-1 products such as Ozempic, Saxenda, and Mounjaro, marks a significant shift in the global approach to managing obesity. In this article, we look at three obesity drug stocks investors should consider.\n\nShares of the companies producing these drugs soared in 2023 as demand outstripped supply and projections suggesting a market growth to $150 billion annually within the next decade. The surge is driven by the drugs\u2019 effectiveness not only in weight loss but also in potentially improving overall health, such as reducing heart failure symptoms.\n\nThe accessibility of these treatments is hindered by insurance hurdles, notably Medicare\u2019s exclusion of weight loss medication coverage due to a 2003 law, raising concerns about equitable access to potentially life-saving treatments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe escalating demand has led to shortages, fueling fears about patients turning to the black market for alternatives, which could have dangerous consequences. As the world grapples with these issues, the long-term health impacts and the economic implications of the obesity drug boom remain critical areas for ongoing scrutiny and policy adaptation.\n\nNearly a quarter of the world\u2019s population will be obese by 2035, a significant increase from 14% in 2020, according to latest projections. In the United States alone, the economic fallout from obesity is staggering, with the negative impact on the gross domestic product (GDP) estimated at 3.6%. According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), this figure translates into a potential $1.24 trillion in indirect costs, primarily due to lost productivity.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the top three obesity drug stocks set to skyrocket.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical leader which has made significant strides in the obesity treatment market with its innovative product, Mounjaro (tirzepatide). Mounjaro, initially approved for managing type 2 diabetes, has shown promising results in weight loss, positioning it as a potential game-changer in obesity management.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s diabetes medication, Mounjaro, achieved an impressive $5 billion in sales during 2023, its debut year, indicating a high demand for this therapy and similar drugs. The strong performance contributed to Lilly\u2019s annual revenue reaching $34 billion, marking a 20% growth from the previous year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter alone, revenue hit $9.35 billion, surpassing expectations by 5%. Mounjaro now represents 27% of all U.S. prescriptions for injectable incretins, a class of drugs that enhance insulin production through hormone modulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, sales for Trulicity, Lilly\u2019s older incretin-based drug, declined by 4% to $7 billion, though it remains a key product. Additionally, Lilly\u2019s obesity drug Zepbound, sharing Mounjaro\u2019s active ingredient, launched in the fourth quarter, generating $176 million in sales by year-end. According to Morgan Stanley\u2019s projection, Zepbound could generate between $2.2 billion and $2.7 in sales.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO)\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is also at the forefront of the obesity treatment market with its revolutionary drugs, Saxenda and Wegovy. These revolutionary products, which suppress appetite and promote weight loss, pushed NVO stock to record highs and positioned it as one of the top obesity drug stocks to buy.\n\nIn January, the Danish pharmaceutical giant announced a surge in sales for its renowned obesity and diabetes medications, Wegovy and Ozempic, propelling its valuation beyond the $500 billion mark.\n\nThe stock price surge has established Novo Nordisk as Europe\u2019s highest-valued firm, surpassing even luxury behemoth LVMH. The obesity drug sector saw a staggering 154% increase in sales, primarily driven by Wegovy, while diabetes medication sales, including Ozempic, rose by 52%.\n\nSales in the Diabetes and Obesity care sector rose by 38% to DKK 215.1 billion, with a remarkable 42% growth at constant exchange rates. This significant increase was primarily propelled by a 48% growth in GLP-1 diabetes treatment sales, which reached 52% in constant rates. Furthermore, the Obesity care segment was up by 147% in Danish Kroner to 41.6 billion, and achieved an even more impressive 154% growth at constant exchange rates.\n\nDexCom (DXCM) Dexcom (DXCM) logo on an app store page on a mobile phone\n\nSource: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com\n\nDexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) is one of the major players in glucose monitoring technology, primarily focusing on diabetes management rather than obesity products. The company\u2019s Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time glucose readings, aiding people with diabetes in managing their condition and potentially contributing to obesity management by enabling better glycemic control.\n\nBack in February, Dexcom reported a 27% increase in revenue to $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, with both U.S. and international markets contributing equally to this growth. The company\u2019s operating income rose to $216.9 million for the same period of the year.\n\nOn the strategic front, Dexcom submitted Stelo, a new sensor for type 2 diabetes patients not on insulin, for FDA review and enhanced its pump connectivity options. This includes the integration with Tandem Diabetes Care\u2019s t:slim X2 insulin pump and Beta Bionics\u2019 iLet Bionic Pancreas. Moreover, Dexcom is innovating with a direct-to-watch feature pending FDA approval, allowing users to receive glucose readings directly on a smartwatch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A former Morgan Stanley banker who was punished in the block-trading probe that rattled Wall Street joined one of the firms that was the recipient of confidential information he leaked.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Iran\u2019s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare Trumpism Is Emptying Churches Apple\u2019s India iPhone Output Hits $14 Billion in China Shift\n\nPawan Passi was hired by Frank Fu\u2019s CaaS Capital Management, according to people familiar with the matter. CaaS made its name partnering with banks as they sought buyers for block trades, becoming one of the biggest US funds dedicated to buying big chunks of stocks.\n\nA yearslong investigation into block trading that reverberated across the industry culminated in January after Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $249 million to the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Passi also agreed to a monetary fine and a one-year ban from the industry as part of his pact with the SEC.\n\nHe\u2019s able to work at CaaS because three weeks ago the firm terminated its registration with the SEC, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nBloomberg has previously reported Fu\u2019s CaaS Capital was among a handful of unnamed firms described in legal documents that got leaks on upcoming stock trades. Morgan Stanley employees doled out the information, with the expectation that hedge funds would short the stocks and position themselves to buy parts of a block once it hit the market.\n\nProsecutors haven\u2019t accused any buy-side participants that allegedly received the tips of any wrongdoing.\n\nCaaS Capital\u2019s Fu didn\u2019t answer a phone call and text seeking comment on the hire. Passi responded to a call at CaaS but declined to comment.\n\nPassi\u2019s agreement with the SEC enforced a 12-month ban from the brokerage business. The deal also prevented him from working for an investment adviser for the same amount of time.\n\nStory continues\n\nCaaS used to call itself a \u201cglobal investment manager\u201d but now says it\u2019s a \u201csingle family office,\u201d according to its website. That allows it to give up its status as an investment adviser because it no longer has outside clients.\n\nPassi also entered into a six month deferred-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and pleaded not guilty to securities fraud to resolve the probe that cost him his career at Morgan Stanley. The DOJ didn\u2019t impose any monetary penalty, citing the roughly $7.4 million in forfeited compensation from his former employer due to the alleged conduct.\n\nRead More: Block-Trading Whale Entangled in U.S. Probe of Morgan Stanley\n\nPassi got to know Fu around 2016 when he was working at Laurion Capital Management. During Fu\u2019s last five years at Laurion, he made more than $40 million, according to a lawsuit filed over the terms of his exit in 2019.\n\nWhen Fu, a Cornell-educated engineer, opened his own hedge fund, he picked an unlikely niche.\n\nCaaS focused on block trading, one of the last bastions of old Wall Street, where big slugs of stock are sold through person-to-person negotiation. CaaS is short for \u201ccapital as a service.\u201d\n\nAfter Archegos Capital Management collapsed in March 2021, Fu\u2019s CaaS was a helpful partner for the lenders unwinding Bill Hwang\u2019s highly levered portfolio. A regulatory filing at the end of the month showed CaaS scooped up more than $440 million of the stocks that Archegos had been betting on.\n\nWith the termination of its registration with the SEC, CaaS has laid out new goals.\n\n\u201cOur overarching objective is to cultivate mutually advantageous relationships among all our stakeholders,\u201d the firm says on its revamped website. \u201cAll while remaining true to our family\u2019s core values of effecting positive change in the world through our investment endeavors.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "Big banks churned out more profits for much of 2023 as regional lenders struggled, but their performance in the first quarter is not expected to dazzle.\n\nInvestors may not mind, as long as the giant banks can demonstrate how they benefit if interest rates remain higher than expected this year.\n\n\"At the end of the day, what is the market paying attention to?\" said Ken Leon, a large bank analyst for CFRA Research.\n\n\"It's really looking to what these banks will do for the rest of 2024 and 2025.\"\n\nAnalysts expect JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) to report that their first-quarter profits were up from the fourth quarter of 2023 but down when compared to the same year-ago period. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America; Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase; and Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup testify last December in Washington, DC. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win McNamee via Getty Images)\n\nThat year-over-year drop for all four institutions hasn\u2019t happened since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in the second quarter of 2022. JPMorgan, Wells and Citigroup release results Friday, and Bank of America on Tuesday.\n\nTheir numbers will likely demonstrate that even the biggest banks are wrestling with slower loan demand and mounting troubles for some borrowers. Bad debt write offs are expected to surge by 76% and new provisions set aside to cover future loan losses are expected to jump 31%.\n\nMuch of the increase in write-offs will likely come from souring credit card loans, according to David Fanger, a senior vice president with Moody's Investor Service.\n\nBut investors may be more interested in the rest of 2024 than the first quarter. So far this year they have been rewarding the biggest banks at the expense of smaller rivals.\n\nThe stocks of Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Bank of America have climbed 20%, 17%, 16% and 112% so far this year \u2014 outperforming major indexes.\n\nWhat could help drive those stocks higher is if the banks predict more profits for the rest of the year due to changing expectations of how many rate cuts are expected this year from the Fed.\n\nTraders now expect one or two cuts, instead of the six they predicted at the beginning of the year, due to hot economic data and signs of persistent inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nFewer cuts actually benefit the giant banks because it allows them to charge more for their loans while keeping funding costs relatively low, boosting a key measure of profits known as net interest income. That dynamic helped them churn out profits for much of 2023.\n\n\u201cEvery time the number of rate cuts and timing is pushed out, the street is updating their expectations of what net interest income could look like this year,\" Ebrahim Poonawala, a large bank analyst for BofA Securities, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGerard Cassidy, a large bank analyst for RBC said in a research note Monday that as 2024 progresses \u201cwe could see upward revisions to EPS estimates driven by better-than-expected net interest income growth and outperformance on credit quality.\u201d\n\nWhat could also help the stocks of big banks is more optimism about dealmaking and trading for the rest of 2024. That issue will be of particular interest to stockholders of Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), two Wall Street-reliant institutions that report Monday and Tuesday.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nThe big banks are expected to report that first-quarter revenues from underwriting bonds and IPOs rose while advising on mergers and acquisitions still lags \u2014 extending a problem that challenged banks for much for 2023 and 2022.\n\n\"What you\u2019ve seen is the debt underwriting business picking up significantly,\" said BofA's Poonawala, who also pointed out that regulatory scrutiny hasn't been conducive to big deals.\n\nM&A recovery also just takes longer, according to Moody's Fanger.\n\n\"What's being completed in this quarter were deals that were agreed to in Q2 or Q3 of last year,\" he said.\n\nTrading revenues are expected to be down across the board from last year, although Bank of America could buck the trend, according to analyst estimates.\n\nInvestors may not be as kind to regional banks as they begin reporting results in the coming weeks. Mid-sized lenders are expected to struggle more if the Fed does in fact keep rates higher for longer, since they have been paying much more than giant lenders to keep their deposits intact.\n\nRegional banks also face more exposure to some commercial real estate loans that have lost value and need to be refinanced, an emerging source of problems for some institutions such as New York Community Bancorp (NYCB).\n\n\"Bigger banks\u2019 revenues are more diversified and they don't have as much commercial real estate exposure,\" Chris McGratty, a regional bank analyst and head of US bank research for KBW, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor all of 2024, KBW expects big bank profits to rise 4%. Regional and smaller lenders will see a 9-10% drop in their net income for the same period.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Passive income brings joy.\n\nMaking your money work for you allows for capital gains upon selling investments. However, not all investments will make you money, and smart investors know caution is recommended when choosing stocks.\n\nSo, passive income investors wisely look out for dividend stocks, identifying companies with strong records of dividend payments, stable balance sheets and steady cash flows. These companies believe in rewarding investors and will hike dividends over the years. Also, these global giants own an impressive record of dividend payments and are trading at an attractive valuation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, if you have limited cash on hand and are looking for dividend stocks under $100, explore these three top picks.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading at $59, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has a dividend yield of 1.39%. Once known as a traditional brick-and-mortar company, it has transformed into a successful e-commerce business.\n\nIn Q4 results, Walmart reported an online sales growth of 17% in the U.S. and 23% globally. It saw a 4% rise in comparable store sales across the U.S. While it remains the biggest U.S. grocery store, its giant strides increase its e-commerce space domination. Besides running over 10,000 stores today, WMT is investing aggressively in the e-commerce.\n\nIts business model continues to focus on the basics including health and wellness and groceries. The healthy growth in its top and bottom lines show that the company is doing well despite the inflationary pressures.\n\nAs consumer spending improves, we could see Walmart report stronger numbers, improving its cash flow position. In 2024, the company saw its cash flow increase to $15.1 billion from $3.1 billion. Thus, it raised the dividend by 9% to reach $0.21 per share. WMT stock is a resilient, safe investment for passive income investors.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) An image of a large brick wall painting of the top of a glass with a white \"Coca-Cola\" logo on it filled with soda and ice with soda splasing from the top of it on a red background.\n\nSource: Luciano Mortula - LGM / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe global conglomerate Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)\u00a0enjoys a dividend yield of 3.27%. The dividend aristocrat has raised its dividends over the last six decades, with a payout ratio of 68%. Although KO stock has moved sideways over the past few months, it is trading at $59 today. And down 5% in the year, there isn\u2019t much to worry about.\n\nCoca-Cola has been a strong industry player, diversifying into healthy drinks to meet consumer demands. Its well-marketed brand is a part of the lifestyle worldwide. Since it has sold off most of its bottling plants to local bottlers, currently KO focuses on marketing and advertising.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales of the concentrated syrup to the bottles provides most of the revenue. This is what has helped Coca-Cola keep going while ensuring that the operating costs remain at a minimum.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to beat Coca-Cola\u2019s dividend growth and reliability. The management is optimistic about 2024 growth prospects with organic sales between 6% to 7%. Thus, it has enough cash to keep rewarding shareholders in the coming years.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading for $94 today, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) transitioned from a traditional investment bank to a wealth management company. And, it generates the majority of its revenue from wealth management services today.\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.65% and a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, it certainly looks attractive. Through acquisitions, MS manages to boost the wealth management revenue by over 40%. So it has become a strong play in uncertain economic cycles. Morgan Stanley makes money primarily in the form of fees from the assets under management. And as these assets rise, revenue soars.\n\nIn the\u00a0last quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.85 and net revenue of $12.9 billion. Ending the year on a strong note, expect the momentum to continue.\n\nMorgan Stanley has hiked dividends for 10 consecutive years, and it is set to report results on April 16. The company could beat estimates yet again and have another dividend hike. The stock is very close to the 52-week high, but strong results could take it higher. \r\n\r\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Solar Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "Solar stocks are gaining ground again in 2024 after hawkish federal and domestic supply chain issues led to a decline in share prices. This is thanks to policy issues focusing on this market segment regardless of Republican and Democratic platforms. And solar stocks will remain center stage as we near the next U.S. presidential election.\n\nThese three renewable energy stocks have double-digit upsides, ranging from 25% to over 240%. The first one is getting analyst love from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Deutsche Bank. The second pick is a company in transition, becoming a storage-led enterprise. The last one is creating a first-of-its-kind \u201cmicro-utility\u201d in California that focuses on solar and storage. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpect Arizona-based First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) to attract value-conscious investors soon. Shares closed on Friday at around $174, down over 17% year over year (YOY). The dip will come as a surprise since First Solar offers the most eco-efficient photovoltaic (PV) solution. Still, numbers indicate no solar stock could escape rising interest rates, policy changes and rising material costs in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNevertheless, First Solar is coming off a great year, with three consecutive earnings beats brightening its prospects for 2024. FSLR recorded $3.3 billion in net sales for 2023, with a significant surge to $1.2 billion in Q4. In large part, this is because of increasing module sales, especially in late 2023.\n\nAlso, First Solar anticipates a more profitable year in 2024, with estimated revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion and a diluted EPS prediction of $13 to $14. To avoid supply chain issues, First Solar has obtained an extra 700 megawatts of advanced PV solar modules. It\u2019s a strategic part of a 4-gigawatt master supply deal with Silicon Ranch.\n\nRecently, Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $245, maintaining an overweight rating. The investment bank spotlights FSLR\u2019s strong risk-adjusted earnings profile and its sold-out position through 2026. Further, a Deutsche Bank analyst is similarly bullish. Analysts are projecting over 26% upside based on a target price of around $220.\n\nStory continues\n\nSunrun (RUN) Person holding cellphone with logo of U.S. solar energy company Sunrun Inc. (RUN) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) is following a similar trajectory to FSLR, with shares down 39%. But, analyst estimates point to a 71% upside. Apart from that, Sunrun is particularly attractive. A company in transition, it\u2019s moving from traditional solar installations to energy storage.\n\nSunrun deployed 219.7 Megawatt hours (MWh) of storage capacity in Q4 of 2023, up 154% year over year (YOY) and 25% sequentially. Also, 227.1 megawatts (MW) of solar energy capacity were installed. By the end of 2023, the total networked solar energy capacity reached 6,689 MW, firm footsteps on the transition path. If you think these stats are impressive, Sunrun installed 1.01GW of new solar installations in 2023.\n\nNot to be outdone, Sunrun anticipates installing 800-1,000 MWh of storage capacity by 2024, a 40%-75% annual increase. The estimated range for the entire year is between 971 and 1,073 MW, indicating a potential ramp-up to 5% YOY.\n\nTherefore, RUN holds a strong position as it shifts focus toward solar storage.\n\nSunnova Energy International (NOVA) A banner for Sunnova Energy International (NOVA) hangs on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nSunnova Energy International (NYSE:NOVA) wraps up our discussion on solar stocks, offering a potential upside of 240%.\n\nNOVA\u2019s strong buy rating is attributed to several creative projects, such as the first-of-its-kind \u201cmicro-utility\u201d in California. A wholly-owned subsidiary leads the project, which intends to provide self-sustaining micro-utilities for new housing communities.\n\nSunnova will be able to work with developers to deploy distributed solar-powered microgrids, focusing on newly constructed houses. An application for the project is with the California Public Utilities Commission. \u200b\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Department of Energy guarantees up to $3.0 billion in partial loans conditionally under Project Hestia. Underprivileged communities will have more access to Sunnova\u2019s clean energy services since the financial flows connected with their loans will be partially guaranteed. The initiative is anticipated to enable Sunnova loan originations of between $4.0 and $5.0 billion, lowering the cost of capital.\n\nSetting aside all of these activities, Sunnova stands out from other solar stocks thanks to strong execution. By the end of 2023, it had added over 419,000 customers, with over 34,000 users brought into service in Q4 alone.\n\nIn the middle of all this, don\u2019t ignore the client loan portfolio, which brought in $115.9 million for the year. Thus, Sunnova wants to build on these stats and add between 185,000 and 195,000 new customers in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "By Tatiana Bautzer and Mehnaz Yasmin\n\n(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley nominated former UK financial regulator Megan Butler to its board of directors, the bank said in a filing on Friday.\n\nButler, 59, previously served as executive director at the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Shareholders will vote on director nominees at Morgan Stanley's virtual annual meeting on May 23.\n\nMorgan Stanley in January agreed to pay $249 million to settle a government investigation into its block trading practices in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe bank also on Friday laid out details for executive pay for the shareholder vote, reflecting an average increase of 13% for its top five executives.\n\nThe board awarded Executive Chairman James Gorman, who served as CEO until the end of last year, a 17% pay bump to $37 million.\n\nDirectors cited Gorman's \"exemplary executive talent development,\" which \"led to the successful execution of an orderly, multi-year CEO succession planning process that is uncommon in financial services.\"\n\nThe bank also explained its decision to pay $20 million one-time awards to new CEO Ted Pick, who took the helm at the start of the year, and Co-Presidents Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz \"to reinforce the message of collaboration in leadership through the transition.\"\n\nExcluding the one-time award, Pick's compensation for last year stood at $25 million when he ran the bank's division encompassing investment banking and trading.\n\nSaperstein, who leads wealth and investment management, was awarded $21.5 million. Simkowitz, the former head of investment management who now leads institutional securities, was given $20 million. Finance chief Sharon Yeshaya was awarded $13.5 million.\n\nMorgan Stanley will report first-quarter earnings on April 16.\n\n(Reporting by Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru and Tatiana Bautzer in New York; Editing by Lananh Nguyen, Krishna Chandra Eluri and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court said former ViacomCBS investors may sue Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks that underwrote two stock offerings for the media company, upholding a ruling that banks fear could upend capital markets.\n\nThursday's decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan came one week after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Goldman and Morgan Stanley by investors in ViacomCBS and other stocks once held by Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management.\n\nInvestors said the banks hid their role as counterparties in total return swaps for Archegos, and dumped their shares to avoid losses in March 2021 as Archegos, with about $20 billion of ViacomCBS exposure, missed margin calls and swiftly imploded.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoldman and Morgan Stanley, which were two of Archegos' prime brokers, said banks already followed a slew of procedures to avert conflicts of interest, protect client confidences and prevent insider trading.\n\nThey said the \"sweeping expansion\" of disclosures ordered by a trial judge last year would \"pull the rug out\" from under countless banks, including by requiring them to predict how their stock holdings would affect markets.\n\nBut the five-judge appeals court said ViacomCBS' banks had a duty to disclose transactions that \"affect\" the stock price, and that saying in offering documents they \"may\" conduct such transactions could be misleading if they were already planned.\n\nThe court also said the banks wouldn't have to reveal confidential information about clients, and could have simply disclosed their intent to sell ViacomCBS shares without mentioning Archegos.\n\nKannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who argued the appeal for Goldman and Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit concerned offerings of ViacomCBS common and preferred stock in March 2021.\n\nInvestors were led by the Camelot Event Driven Fund and the Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday's decision largely upheld a February 2023 ruling by Justice Andrew Borrok of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.\n\nIn the federal ruling, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said investors in Archegos' stocks did not adequately allege that Goldman and Morgan Stanley conducted insider trading, or breached any fiduciary duty to the individual companies.\n\nHwang and former Archegos Chief Financial Officer Patrick Halligan face a scheduled May 8 criminal trial in Manhattan over their roles in Archegos' collapse.\n\nThe case is Camelot Event Driven Fund et al v Morgan Stanley & Co et al, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1st Department, No. 2023-00983.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

        "title": "Passive Income Perfection: 7 Dividend Stocks to Generate $50,000 Per Year",
        "content": "The topic of passive income is popular these days. Investors, consumers, and many other individuals are curious about any method that can produce income without work. Dividend stocks are an excellent example of one such method. In fact, investors can buy dividend stocks for $50,000 per year income.\n\nDividend stocks are one of the most reliable sources of passive income available. Investors have been using dividends to create wealth for hundreds of years, in fact several hundred years. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company began paying dividends to its investors. The trend continues today and has been well refined through time tested methods.\n\nLet\u2019s also be realistic here, $50,000 per year in passive income from dividends requires a substantial portfolio. at an average 5% yield an investor will need $1 million in dividend bearing stocks to create $50K in income yearly. Let\u2019s take a look at seven stocks to consider that can get any investor to that goal with enough time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has transitioned from an investment bank to a firm more oriented toward wealth management in recent times. That transition has made it one of the better dividend stocks to consider for investors seeking passive income.\n\nMy colleague Charles Munyi outlined the bank\u2019s transition toward wealth management in a recent article. Essentially, Morgan Stanley bought up several advisories in the wake of the 2008-2009 crisis. The result is that the company now derives a much greater percentage of revenues from wealth management. This makes it one of those stocks for $50,000 per year income.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s dividend currently yields 3.5% and was last reduced in 2010. It\u2019s also well within the healthy range with a payout ratio of 0.6. The dividend has also grown by nearly 27% over the last 5 years. That\u2019s much higher than the average dividend growth rate of 8 to 10%. Excessive growth can signal risk. In this case the higher rate is probably a representation of the company\u2019s dedication to its shift toward attracting greater wealth management revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltria (MO) packs of cigarettes in convenience store rack\n\nSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) is an exceptional dividend stock overall. The company sits among the ranks of the dividend kings. The dividend kings is an elite group of stocks that have not reduced their dividend payment within the last 50 years. It also yields nearly 9% which is quite high.\n\nThus, it provides an exceptional mix of yields and reliability that no other stock can. The reason that Altria is so unique relates to the nature of its industry which is in transition. The company sells tobacco and its fortunes are underpinned by its ownership of Marlboro. With smoking levels continuing to decline Altria is transitioning to smokeless alternatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s e-cigarette brand, NJOY, doesn\u2019t dominate its market. Instead, it sits in third place overall.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to navigate this transitional period will define the future of its dividend.\n\nMeanwhile, Altria recently bolstered its share repurchase program through the sale of $2.4 billion dollars worth of Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) stock. It all suggests that Altria\u2019s dividend is safe for the midterm at least. For investors seeking $50,000 per year from dividend stocks MO shares are an excellent choice.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock isn\u2019t far behind Altria in terms of reliability: The firm last reduced its dividend in 1983. That dividend is a prime point of attraction for investors. The energy market is a volatile one as the price of oil can fluctuate drastically from year to year. Exxon Mobil\u2019s dividend provides income and returns that smooth that volatility.\n\nThen in boom years like 2022 the company does exceptionally well providing an excellent opportunity for investors to cash out and profit. Investors learned that they can count on Exxon Mobil to continue paying its dividend through the pandemic and that it does create significant wealth creating opportunities at the same time.\n\nExxon Mobil and other energy giants are particularly attractive at the moment. The electric vehicle sector is in disarray and provides a strong antithesis to a rapid oil-free transition. In other words, ExxonMobil stock continues to be a beacon of reliability despite perceived challenges.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) A photo of a paper with a chart and the word \"Dividends\" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.\n\nSource: jittawit21/Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)\u00a0 continues to be an interesting choice among dividend stocks. The company has successfully navigated through the transition of Humira going off patent. Fear related to that had long plagued the company but it looks like it has mostly survived unscathed.\n\nThe company has successfully introduced other drugs to combat declining revenues. The result is that while revenues are slightly down in 2023 overall, most analysts believe the company has done well.\n\nSimply put, AbbVie wouldn\u2019t be able to continue paying its dividend if the company didn\u2019t manage that transition. Analysts from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) believe that ABBV shares are worth $200. Those analysts believe that earnings will improve as revenues from drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq replace those from Humira.\n\nEarnings is one of the primary areas to focus on for ABBV investors. The stock\u2019s P/E ratio isn\u2019t strong at the moment. However, the company\u2019s diverse portfolio has shown massive turnaround potential of late and those earnings could quickly reverse. That\u2019s essentially what Wells Fargo is saying in attaching a $200 target price to ABBV at present. The company will continue to pay dividends as it has since 1972. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how everything pans out but it looks like AbbVie will emerge stronger.\n\nPepsi (PEP) stock market ticker screen with the word \"dividends\" appearing in large text. Must-Have Dividend Stocks. Dividend kings to own\n\nSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.com\n\nPepsi (NYSE:PEP) is another dividend king, making it a very reliable stock overall. It\u2019s a nice addition to any portfolio for investors seeking to generate $50,000 in dividend income annually.\n\nOne of the most important things to consider when discussing Pepsi is its recent performance in light of inflation. The company has fared very well over the last few years as inflation has become endemic. What\u2019s important to note here is that Pepsi doesn\u2019t only sell beverages, it also has a large portfolio of snack foods. Its beverages and snack foods have become much more expensive. However, consumer\u00a0 demand remains steadfast. In fact, organic revenues increased by nearly 10% in 2023. That suggests Pepsi will now be able to charge those higher prices moving forward.\n\nConsumers shouldn\u2019t expect those prices to\u00a0 revert to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, they should expect a stabilization of prices. That means Pepsi will be able to depend on higher sales you forward and continue to pay a reliable dividend. In fact, Pepsi announced that it will increase its annual dividend by 7% beginning in June.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a stock that represents an intriguing mix of growth and income that should continue to attract investors.\n\nShare prices have appreciated dramatically over the past year. The legacy technology company has essentially positioned itself well in relation to AI. Strong investments have resulted in a book of business that doubled sequentially for AI workloads between the third and fourth quarter. That news served to reaffirm the recent increase in prices which is predicated on its AI potential.\n\nAnyway, That\u2019s The Story of IBM as it relates to growth. The company is well positioned to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other trends like quantum computing.Those opportunities may very well allow the company to shed its image as a legacy firm.\n\nThat\u2019s compelling in and of itself but then add in its dividend and IBM becomes even more attractive. The company is reliable for income investors: It last reduced its dividend in 1994. It all adds up to create a company that represents a unique opportunity for investors looking to build $50k annually in passive income.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is one of many legacy cigarette companies that continues to offer a lot to investors at the moment. The stock provides a dividend yielding more than 5.5% and is relatively stable having last been reduced in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially the same story for Philip Morris as for all other cigarette stocks: these firms are navigating a transition to lower arm tobacco products while relying on cigarettes to underpin their businesses.\n\nIn the case of Philip Morris, that also means taking some risks. The company has to find new sources of revenue to make up for declining smoking rates. The company is buying assets at a rate well in excess of revenue growth. That suggests inefficiency.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s an inefficiency born of necessity. Philip Morris has to find new growth. As it searches for that growth investors should simply take advantage of its dividend. It\u2019s the same story that investors will find in relation to Altria, discussed above.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) ended the recent trading session at $93, demonstrating a +0.31% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.11%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.23%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the investment bank had gained 4.02% over the past month. This has outpaced the Finance sector's gain of 2.37% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.5% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Morgan Stanley in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on April 16, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.71, up 0.59% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.4 billion, down 0.79% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.35 per share and revenue of $56.63 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.3% and +4.59%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.24% downward. At present, Morgan Stanley boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at valuation, Morgan Stanley is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.6. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 16.69.\n\nAlso, we should mention that MS has a PEG ratio of 1.88. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory.

This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, finds itself in the top 16% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

        "title": "3 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy for Under $100 in April",
        "content": "Passive income investing is a great way to build wealth. It will take years for you to generate enough for your retirement or to leave a legacy, but it is a tried and tested way of making money without having to work for it. Whether you are a beginner or want to diversify your portfolio, investing in dividend stocks is a great way to build wealth.\n\nWhen choosing dividend stocks, do not just look at their yield. Instead, focus on the balance sheet and sustainability of the dividends. Look for solid companies that have been rewarding investors for years and have hiked their dividends even in times of economic uncertainty. Such companies are rock solid and can help build wealth if you hold on to them.\n\nAs a passive investor myself, I love it when companies hike dividends each quarter. It allows me to reinvest those dividends, helping me build wealth slowly and steadily. If you are looking for dividend stocks to invest in, here are the top dividend stocks to buy for under $100 in April.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop Dividend Stocks to Buy for Under $100 in April: Coca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nTrading at $60, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock looks very cheap to me. The global giant has built a name for itself in the industry and its wide range of beverages keeps the revenue growing. The stock is down 3% in the year and has been moving in the range of $52 to $64 over the past 12 months. While you may not see a sudden upside in the stock price, you can make the most of the dividends.\n\nCoca-Cola is a Dividend Aristocrat and has increased its dividends for over 60 years. Its recent dividend hike was the 62nd consecutive increase. It raised the dividend to 5.4% quarterly to 48.5 cents per share. Its annual dividend yield is 3.23%, and the dividend payout is 78%, which is better than several other players in the industry.\n\nWhile the company has been lagging behind the market, it still has strong fundamentals, and the business generates adequate free cash flow to sustain the dividends. In the past four quarters, the company generated a free cash flow of $9.5 billion and also repurchased $1.7 billion worth of stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has also diversified into healthy drinks and energy drinks to meet the changing demands of consumers. Coca-Cola is not the one to sit back and enjoy the business growth. It is constantly looking for new avenues to expand and is working on innovative marketing campaigns, limited edition flavors and targeted promotions. As Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite stock, Coca-Cola still has a lot of power and is worth holding on to for years.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother dividend stock to buy below $100 is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Trading at $92, the stock has soared 16% in the past six months, and the bank has built a strong business model recently. However, the stock is still trading at the same level it was in May 2021. It is one of the top dividend stocks to buy for under $100 in April.\n\nMS stock hasn\u2019t been able to hit $100 over the past two years but is steadily improving its position. With a rate cut and an improvement in the economy, we will see Morgan Stanley report impressive numbers.\n\nThe bank has moved past the financial crisis and has become a huge part of the investment world and wealth management. It steadily earns fees on the assets under management (AUM), which keeps growing as the assets grow.\n\nThe company makes a significant part of the revenue from underwriting deals, which grew 25% in the fourth quarter. I believe the second half of the year will be great, as interest rates are expected to come down. That also allows Morgan Stanley to have a fixed revenue business and shields it from economic ups and downs.\n\nThere is an improved outlook for the company, which can benefit investors. Morgan Stanley enjoys a yield of 3.67%. Despite a dividend yield of over 3%, the company has a payout ratio of 66%, which means there is ample space for growth. If the business keeps expanding, you can expect dividend hikes.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHaving raised dividends for 14 consecutive years, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a dividend stock worth buying while it trades below $100. The stock is exchanging hands for $89 and had a rough start to the year. The stock is down 6% year-to-date and 14% over the year.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials are robust, but it reported a drop in sales in China. That led to a dip in the stock. However, I believe the coffee giant has a long way to go. It has a robust free cash flow growth, and the dividend has grown 18% in the last 10 years.\n\nAs one of the global players, Starbucks has gained brand loyalty and is on an aggressive expansion mission. It aims to open 55,000 stores by 2030, leading to a massive rise in revenue.\n\nThe company is also experimenting with different drinks to meet the needs of consumers across different countries. While the competition is growing, I think it will be hard to beat Starbucks when it comes to a coffee chain.\n\nThe stock has a dividend yield of 2.55% and a dividend payout ratio of 61%. As a passive income investor, you will not be disappointed with Starbucks. While the company missed revenue projections for the first quarter, it has slashed guidance for full-year sales, which resulted in a stock price drop.\n\nThe current issues are temporary, and the company can bounce back in the coming months. An improvement in consumer spending and the upcoming summer months could boost sales.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Towards the end of the just completed first quarter, U.S.-based hedge funds began dumping American equities and shifting capital into European stocks. In an analysis, investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) found that hedge funds \u201chave bought EU equities in nearly 70% of the trading sessions\u201d since the European stock market began to rally in January of this year. Hedge fund exposure to Europe has grown from below 17% at the end of 2023 to roughly 19% at the end of Q1 this year, says Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe move into European stocks comes amid growing concerns that U.S. equities have become too expensive and are in overbought territory. Europe\u2019s main STOXX 600 index is up 7% so far this year, lagging the 10% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index in the U.S. The S&P 500 index currently trades at 21 times forward earnings estimates, while European equities trade at 14 times, according to data from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nIn a recent note to clients, investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that \u201cEurope has room to catch up with the U.S.\u201d as the discount between both is the deepest it has ever been.

Soros Fund is one of several hedge funds that have been buying up stock of the company that makes the popular weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Soaring demand for the weight loss medications has NVO stock up 60% in the last 12 months, including a 25% gain so far in 2024.\n\nHuge demand for its weight loss drugs and rising stock price has made Novo Nordisk Europe\u2019s largest publicly traded company with a current market capitalization of $437.25 billion. Hedge funds have been buying up NVO stock on expectations of strong future earnings and as the company develops a weight loss pill to replace the current injections that are used to administer the medications. A pill is forecast to be a gamechanger for the burgeoning market for weight loss prescriptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nDutch semiconductor company ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is owned by so many hedge funds that in February of this year, Morgan Stanley put out a report stating that ASML is one of Europe\u2019s most \u201cover-owned\u201d stocks. The company specializes in the development and manufacturing of photolithography machines that are essential to the production of computer microchips. Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling demand for ASML\u2019s technology, sending the stock up nearly 40% this year alone.\n\nAppaloosa Management is a hedge funds that\u2019s been betting big on ASML stock since the second half of last year, run by famed investor David Tepper. Appaloosa first opened a position in ASML Holdings stock last August, buying $58 million worth of shares. The hedge fund has steadily increased its stake since then. ASML Holding is growing its role in the global semiconductor market, particularly in China, as AI technologies fuel a renaissance in the sector.\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (SBLK) A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San Francisco\n\nSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) is a lesser known European company and stock. Based in Greece, Star Bulk Carriers is a global shipping company. It operates a fleet of carrier vessels that transports iron ore, coal, and grain between Europe, North America and Asia. SBLK stock gets little attention, but has proven to be a very good investment. It has risen 14% in the last 12 months and 222% in the past five years. The stock also trades at only 13 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSBLK stock pays a hefty quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share, giving it a yield of 6%. So which hedge fund titans own Star Bulk Carriers? None other than Michael Burry, the famed investor profiled in the book and film The Big Short. Burry owns 250,000 shares of the company currently valued at just under $6 million. Star Bulk Carriers is one of only a few European stocks held by Burry\u2019s Scion Asset Management hedge fund, according to its latest 13F securities filing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors who are selling stocks because the Federal Reserve may scale back plans for interest rate cuts are missing the point. The move would be a good sign for the economy \u2014 and therefore equity markets, according Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Andrew Slimmon.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead Trump Media\u2019s Business Doesn\u2019t Matter Iran Vows to Punish Israel for Strike on Embassy in Syria Tesla Disappoints Analysts by Most Ever in Brutal Blow for EVs Caribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU Crackdown\n\n\u201cI think a patient Fed validates that the economy is strong,\u201d Slimmon told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s better for equities.\u201d\n\nSlimmon is worth listening to, as he was correctly optimistic last year while the S&P 500 Index soared 24%. By contrast, his highly publicized Morgan Stanley colleague Mike Wilson, the firm\u2019s leading sell-side strategist, repeatedly called for a rout that never materialized.\n\nAfter the strongest first quarter since 2019, US equities are starting April on a downbeat note as a wave of strong economic data renews concerns that the Fed will be in no rush to loosen policy. In fact, investors are now more hawkish than central bankers, projecting about 65 basis points of rate cuts this year, compared with the 75 basis points signaled by the median estimate of projections released following the Fed\u2019s March meeting.\n\nTraders have recalibrated their expectations for rate reductions throughout this year, dialing back bets to around three reductions from six at the start of 2024. But the S&P 500 still rose over 10% in the first quarter.\n\nThe need for fewer cuts is generally reason for optimism, Slimmon said. Zero rate cuts this year would signal to him that S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2025 can start between $275 and $280, which \u201cvalidates upside for equities,\u201d given the market will look ahead to those projections.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think they would be forced to cut rates if the economy weakens,\u201d he added, something that would pressure earnings estimates for the coming year.\n\nThe risk to this sanguine view is elevated oil prices could pressure stocks in the near term. Slimmon expects the recent spike in commodities to be temporary. But if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut interest rates because oil prices stay higher, that isn\u2019t a sign of economic strength.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an inflation problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet\u2019s Favorite Wok How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards Building Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned FTX\u2019s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto Eclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +8.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 7.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share, indicating a change of +0.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.35 points to a change of +16.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.21 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.4 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.8%. The $56.63 billion and $59.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +4.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +7.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "20 Biggest Financial Mistakes That Young Adults Make",
        "content": "In this article, we will list the 20 biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. We will begin by discussing the financial advisory service market and credit card and student loan debt in the US. If you want to skip this discussion, visit 7 Biggest Financial Mistakes That Young Adults Make.\n\nAccording to experts, by the time you reach 30, you should have saved an amount equal to your yearly salary. For some, this target is achievable. However, for those who make financial mistakes as young adults, it becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nIndividuals and businesses at all stages need to make sound financial decisions and avoid as many financial mistakes as possible. This is why the financial advisory service market is expected to grow at a rate of 5.3% for the forecast period of 2022 to 2032. It was valued at $94.8 billion in 2022 and will reach $157.7 billion by 2032. Businesses and individuals in this industry give financial services and advice to small and medium-sized businesses and high-networth individuals. In addition, more and more people are looking for alternative investments, which is why financial literacy is becoming quite important.\n\nCompanies in the financial services market are some of the largest in the United States. One such is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). It is an investment banking and financial services firm that also provides discretionary investment options to its clients. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) earned a revenue of $54 billion in the past year leading up to September 30th. In the last quarter of the year, Morgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reported growth of $13.27 billion in revenue.\n\nThe United States is the financial hub of the world with the largest GDP. However, many people in the country still lack financial literacy, the signs of which can be seen in its credit card debt. According to a Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Creditby the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average credit card debt was on the rise for Americans at least until the second quarter of 2023. The report tells us that credit card balances increased by $45 billion between quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2023. This amounts to a 4.6% increase in a single quarter. As per the report, cardholders have a total debt of $1.03 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe average balance of credit cards is $5,733 per cardholder. In addition, average credit card interest rates were 20.68% in quarter 2 of 2023. This means that those who pay only the minimum monthly payment on the average $5,733 balance on the credit card end up paying over $1,000 in interest payment. The situation is even worse when we consider the fact that many credit card holders pay their credit card amount in full, so actual balances on credit cards may be higher. The money they will end up paying because of the exorbitant interest rates could have been utilized elsewhere.\n\nAnother financial burden on the American economy comes in the form of student loans. Student debt in the country has been piling up over the years, but 2023 saw a decline. Nevertheless, the outstanding Federal student loan is $1.7 trillion, and accounts for almost 93% of all student loan debt. There are currently more than 43 million student loan borrowers, and the average federal student loan debt balance is more than $37,000.\n\nHowever, The United States government recognizes this situation and sometimes carries out student debt forgiveness schemes. More recently, in January 2024, the Biden Administration approved debt cancellation of 74,000 borrowers. These borrowers include public service workers such as firefighters, nurses, and teachers. Amongst them, 30,000 had been paying back their student loans for at least 20 years.\n\nTaking out student loans and accumulating credit card debt, are part of our list of the 20 biggest financial mistakes that young adults make, although you would have to go through the list to find out where they rank.  20 Biggest Financial Mistakes That Young Adults Make\n\nA customer withdrawing money from an ATM, illustrating the company's widespread availability of accounts.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 20 financial mistakes that young adults make, we went to Reddit and sampled five related threads to read up on real-life experiences of people. We did this instead of sampling the opinions of financial gurus because we learn the best from our mistakes. We noted down each response with a financial mistake along with its upvotes. Then, we categorized these responses into twenty financial mistakes by identifying a common theme. Next, for each category, we summed up the total number of responses to come up with our Insider Monkey Score. The higher this score, the higher the financial mistake ranks in our article. As a tiebreaker, we used the total number of upvotes of the responses in each category.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20 - Driving Under the Influence\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 1\n\nWhile it might not be that obvious, driving under the influence (DUI) is one of the biggest financial mistakes young adults make. A DUI offense can set you back $10,000. The costs include legal fees, court fines, and car towing expenses. In addition, DUI increases your probability of getting injured, which will lead to additional expenses in the form of medical expenditures and loss of income.\n\n19 - Not Managing University Expenses Efficiently\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 1\n\nApart from tuition fees, university expenses can take a toll on your overall finances. A University student can be expected to spend up to $50 weekly on books and study materials. A Reddit user notes that buying brand new books for university when second hands were available at a fraction of the cost was their biggest financial mistake.\n\n18 - Reckless Driving\n\nInsider Monkey Score -1\n\nReckless driving is one of the biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. In case of an accident, a person can spend thousands on repair and treatment and potentially lose income temporarily or permanently.\n\n17 - Making Bad Career Growth Decisions\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nOne of the biggest financial mistakes that young adults make is making bad career growth decisions. Some people stay at a certain job for too long with limited learning and monetary increments. On the other hand, others switch their jobs too frequently and lose the trust of potential employers, limiting their career growth in the long term.\n\n16 - Underestimating Child Care Expenses\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nNot taking into account or underestimating childcare expenses before starting a family is one of the biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. A high-quality infant childcare costs families $1,300 per month. Many individuals who are not financially ready underestimate this expense and start a family, which can be detrimental to their finances.\n\n15- Paying Only Minimum Credit Card Payment\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nPaying only the minimum amount due on credit card balances is one of the biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. By only making the minimum payment, cardholders incur interest charges that increase their balance over time, keeping them in debt for longer. It is also detrimental to the credit score report as credit scoring models consider the credit utilization ratio when calculating the score, making future borrowing more expensive.\n\n14 - Not Setting Up an Emergency Fund\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nNot having an adequate emergency fund can leave individuals vulnerable to unexpected financial crises. Major emergencies like job loss or serious medical issues can occur anytime, at which point an adequate emergency fund helps in covering expenses.\n\n13 - Not Choosing The Right Career\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nNot choosing the right career is a financial mistake that many people make. Users on Reddit note that an individual should try to find a balance between his interests and the financial potential of the job.\n\n12 - Not Planning For Retirement\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nNot planning for retirement is 12th on our list of the 20 biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. Users on Reddit note that young adults do not care about their retirement and, therefore, do not think about setting up their retirement portfolio until it's too late.\n\n11 - Spending Too Much on Clothing\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 2\n\nClothing expenses can take a toll on an individual's finances. Many Reddit users note that young adults often buy overpriced clothing, which they later regret,\n\n10 - Not Budgeting Enough\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 3\n\nFailing to budget is one of the top 10 financial mistakes that young adults make. It helps in tracking expenses, so it is easier to control unwanted expenditures and invest the money for a return.\n\n9 - Indulging in Gambling\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 3\n\nIndulging in gambling is one of the biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. Research indicates that young adults are vulnerable to the negative consequences of gambling, including addiction.\n\n8 - Not Opting For Employee Share Program\n\nInsider Monkey Score - 4\n\nNot opting for an employee share program is one of the biggest financial mistakes that young adults make. This is particularly true for companies that allow the employee to lock in a price to purchase their shares in the future.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 7 Biggest Financial Mistakes That Young Adults Make.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s 13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to Avoid 20 Biggest Social Media Mistakes By Companies in 2023\n\nDisclosure: none. 20 Biggest Financial Mistakes That Young Adults Make is originally published on Insider Monkey",

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: March Edition",
        "content": "Cybersecurity plays an ever-increasing role in our daily lives. Sure, the latest PC you bought or the application you downloaded adds a lot of joy to your life. However, lurking in the shadows are bad guys trying to tap into your privacy.\n\nSo, a surge in cybercrime prompts a rise in cybersecurity. The industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of\u00a011.44% until 2029, presenting secular growth opportunities.\n\nAmong numerous industry constituents, three best-in-class cybersecurity stocks stand out. Each asset hosts solid fundamentals and aligned quantitative metrics. So, let\u2019s delve into the three best cybersecurity picks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an integrated cybersecurity company primarily offering cloud workload and endpoint, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response. Unlike most cyber companies, Crowdstrike provides affordable products and services, allowing succinct customer switching. The firm\u2019s high-quality, fair-cost model has led to secular growth which looks set to continue.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest earnings report illustrated the aforementioned. Crowdstrike\u2019s fourth-quarter report communicated annual recurring revenue of $3.44 billion, a 34.4% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Furthermore, CRWD retained an 80% subscription gross profit margin, suggesting economies of scale are en route.\n\nApproximately 94.16% of the company\u2019s revenue derives from subscriptions. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom provides its Professional Services Segment with significant potential. Despite AI\u2019s popularity, corporate AI transition is complex and generally assisted by cyber companies. Will Crowdstrike leverage this market? It is highly likely.\n\nCRWD is grossly undervalued. For instance, its price-to-sales ratio of 25.58x is at a five-year discount near 12%. Moreover, the stock is trading above its 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages, indicating a momentum trend has occurred.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) operates in the advanced firewall and adjacent cloud-based business. The company hosts best-in-class status with a scintillating return on common equity ratio of\u00a089.52%. Additionally, the stock is highly touted on Wall Street, with numerous analysts backing it to succeed throughout 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few of the calls on Wall Street to set a baseline.\n\nEdward Stanley of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently added Palo Alto Networks to a list of \u201chigh productivity\u201d plays. The basis of Stanley\u2019s argument stems from AI integration and the phenomenon\u2019s operational efficiency benefits. Furthermore, Argus emphasized its bullish outlook on PANW earlier this month, upgrading PANW\u2019s price target to $336 from a previous $290 based on demand factors.\n\nMany investors are worried about Palo Alto Networks\u2019 strategy shift. In an announcement last month, Palo Alto\u2019s management indicated a pivot to provide more free offerings. This could potentially dent its billings by $600 million toward the back end of this year. However, this is a temporary change in strategy to stimulate long-term demand. Basically, Palo Alto\u2019s decision is long-term value-driven. Further, the firm has a cash position of nearly\u00a0$3.37\u00a0billion.\n\nAlso, the stock has a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of\u00a00.01x,\u00a0and the company has a five-year compound annual growth rate of\u00a023.75%. Considering these metrics alongside Palo Alto Networks\u2019 fundamentals, consider it a growth-at-a-reasonable price opportunity.\n\nRadware (RDWR) An image of a shield hovering above a motherboard with a forcefield surrounding it, a person holding a tablet stands facing it\n\nSource: Ico Maker / Shutterstock\n\nRadware (NASDAQ:RDWR) is primarily known for protecting against identity theft, protection against malicious user behavior, and related cloud protection services. Although mostly used for Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) applications, Radware is positioned for future expansion, providing its investors with much to anticipate.\n\nThe company and the stock alike possess numerous tailwinds. First, Radware recently signed a downstream agreement with Spark NZ. This allows Spark to re-sell its services throughout New Zealand, providing Radware with geographic diversification. Furthermore, Radware released its fourth-quarter earnings, beating its revenue target by $990,000 and its earnings target by one cent per share.\n\nFurthermore, its annual recurring revenue grew by 22% YOY. Moreover, RDWR has a price-to-sales ratio of merely 3.12x. Is RDWR undervalued? I certainly think so.\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Readcarefully before investing.\n\nRisk Considerations: There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in the portfolios. Please be aware that the portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Portfolio Turnover. Consistent with its investment policies, the Fund will purchase and sell securities without regard to the effect on portfolio turnover. Higher portfolio turnover will cause the Fund to incur additional transaction costs. Active Management Risk. In pursuing the Portfolio\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions will affect performance. ETF Structure Risks. Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. The Portfolio has a limited number of intermediaries that act as authorized participants and none of these authorized participants is or will be obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. As a result, shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. Cash Transactions Risk. Unlike certain ETFs, the Fund may effect creations and redemptions in cash or partially in cash. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in shares may be less tax-efficient. Trading Risk. The market prices of Shares are expected to fluctuate, in some cases materially, in response to changes in the Portfolio's NAV, the intra-day value of holdings, and supply and demand for Shares. The Adviser cannot predict whether Shares will trade above, below or at their NAV. may pay significantly more or receive significantly less than the Fund\u2019s NAV per share during periods when there is a significant premium or discount. Buying or selling Shares in the secondary market may require paying brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. New Fund Risk. A new portfolio's performance may not represent how the portfolio is expected to or may perform in the long term. In addition, there is a limited operating history for investors to evaluate and the portfolio may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies. See applicable prospectus for details on risks.\n\nEaton Vance, Parametric and Calvert are part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley\u2019s exchange-traded lineup now holds more than $1 billion thanks to the firm\u2019s first-ever mutual-fund conversions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Homebuyers Expecting $10,000 Savings Face Tough Reality Fed\u2019s Powell Ready to Support Job Market, Even If It Means Lingering Inflation Harassment and Drugs Plagued a Citigroup Division for Years Trump Facing Moment of Truth for Finances in Manhattan Court\n\nThe issuer is flipping two fixed-income mutual funds from Eaton Vance \u2014 one that follows a total return bond strategy and one focused on short-duration municipal debt \u2014 into ETFs, the company said in a statement Monday. That brings Morgan Stanley\u2019s total ETF lineup to 14 funds.\n\nThe conversions come as Morgan Stanley seeks to expand its footprint in the increasingly competitive $9 trillion ETF market. While Morgan Stanley was an early supporter of the industry three decades ago, the firm didn\u2019t launch its own products until last year. It has since created ETFs under a handful of Morgan Stanley\u2019s brands, including Calvert, Parametric, and Eaton Vance. Monday\u2019s new converts show Morgan Stanley\u2019s deepening commitment to active, fixed-income ETFs, according to the firm\u2019s global head of ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on some of these industry trends, and the two major ones are fully transparent ETFs and the acceleration of fixed-income,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Anthony Rochte said in a phone interview. \u201cWe thought long and hard about which mutual funds are we going to convert, and which brand will we use.\u201d\n\nIndustry players such as Dimensional Fund Advisors, JPMorgan Asset Management and Fidelity Investments have switched billions of dollars between vehicles after the first mutual fund conversion into an ETF was completed roughly three years ago. While Morgan Stanley has ventured into the process as well, the firm is \u201cvery focused on net new organic launches,\u201d Rochte said.\n\nThe Eaton Vance mutual funds will begin trading on Monday as the Eaton Vance Total Return Bond ETF (ticker EVTR) and the Eaton Vance Short Duration Municipal Income ETF (EVSM). The actively manged funds will charge 32 basis points and 19 basis points, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "16 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 most undervalued large-cap stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\n\nThe Fed's March Decision\n\nOn March 20, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, spoke at a press conference where he highlighted the Fed's interest rate policy moving forward. He noted that the Fed would remain committed to its \"dual mandate\" to promote \"maximum employment and stable prices\" to the population of the United States. While Powell spoke about the resilience of the US economy so far in 2024, he also commented on the fact that inflation being reduced is not an assured development for the year as of yet. The Fed's March decision also highlighted that the Fed would maintain its federal funds rate in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Additionally, Powell stated that the Fed will also continue to remain committed to bringing US inflation down to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nWhile the Fed meeting this March did not pinpoint any month for potential rate cuts this year, many financial professionals expect the first rate cut of 2024 to come in June. Additionally, the Fed is currently anticipating a total of three rate cuts this year, though this may be subject to change depending on external factors influencing the state of the US economy. Chairman Powell noted in the March press conference that high interest rates also impacted business investment in the US throughout 2023. Considering this, keeping updated on the Fed's latest moves in the rate cut department can be vital for investors in the US today.\n\nInvesting in Large-Cap Stocks\n\nAfter the Fed's announcements, US equities and the S&P 500 rallied to record levels. During times of economic uncertainty, investors may be considering where to put their money to ensure higher returns and profitability for themselves and their portfolios. We believe that a good place to start would be the type of stocks that are well-rounded and renowned in the market, particularly stocks with higher market capitalizations, that is, large-cap stocks. This assumption comes from the fact that these stocks have much to offer to investors, both in terms of market capitalization, which typically ranges from $10 billion to $200 billion in the large-cap bracket and in terms of revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy way of example, let's look at the earnings brought in by some of the stocks on our list below. In the fourth quarter, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) had an EPS of $0.66, beating estimates by $0.49, while its $9.9 billion revenue beat estimates by $174.1 million. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) brought in an EPS of $0.54, beating estimates by $0.09, while its $15.4 billion revenue beat estimates by $231.1 million. Finally, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had an EPS of $3.11 for the fourth quarter, beating estimates by $0.33. The company's revenue came in at $2.4 billion and beat estimates by $35.3 million. These are merely three examples of the value and potential of large-cap stocks, and yet an even more exciting prospect for investors in today's market may be the rise of some of the most undervalued stocks in this group since these stocks would offer investors the chance to buy into attractive stock opportunities offering more value than many other stocks in the market. We have thus compiled a list of some of the most undervalued stocks in the market today, including some of the most profitable cheap stocks to buy and some of the most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy. 13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA portfolio manager studying various stocks and other securities on a tablet.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a stock screener to identify large-cap stocks with market capitalizations between $10 billion and $200 billion and then shortlisted the 16 most undervalued stocks by gathering upside potentials for each stock from TipRanks, as of March 21. The stocks are ranked based on their upside potentials, from the lowest to the highest figure. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. \u00a0Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nMost Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\n16. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $98.2\n\nMarket Capitalization: $145.1 billion\n\nUpside Potential: 10.5%\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is an investment banking and brokerage company based in New York. It provides financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals.\n\nAn Outperform rating and a $97 price target were maintained on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on March 19 by Oppenheimer analysts.\n\nThere were 56 hedge funds long Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $2.7 billion.\n\nLike Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is among the most undervalued stocks in the large-cap cohort.\n\n15. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $705.6\n\nMarket Capitalization: $177.8 billion\n\nUpside Potential: 11.3%\n\nWells Fargo analysts maintained an Overweight rating and a $725 price target on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) on February 23.\n\nIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is an application software company that provides financial management and compliance products and services. It is based in Mountain View, California, and is among the most undervalued stocks to invest in this year.\n\nWe saw 75 hedge funds long Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in the fourth quarter, with a total stake value of $6.9 billion.\n\nL1 Capital mentioned Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFor the entirety of 2023, the Fund had investments in less than 30 companies. Half of these investments each positively contributed 1.0% or more (in AUD) to the Fund\u2019s returns for 2023. The Fund\u2019s investments in Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft contributed just over a quarter of the Fund\u2019s total gross returns for 2023. Advanced Micro Devices, Booking Holdings, CRH, Eagle Materials,\u00a0Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Natural Resource Partners also each contributed over 2% (in AUD) to the Fund\u2019s 2023 returns.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in Intuit as, after strong share price appreciation, we now consider the business to be fully valued. We also fully divested our investment in Analog Devices, again purely due to valuation considerations. We remain very comfortable with the quality of both of these businesses, with Intuit retained as a smaller holding and Analog Devices moving to our Bench of potential future investments. As outlined earlier in this report, our base case view is that there will not be a recession, particularly in the United States. However, growth is slowing, and this will negatively impact demand for many of Analog Devices\u2019 products.\u201d\n\n14. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $44.7\n\nMarket Capitalization: $167.9 billion\n\nUpside Potential: 11.8%\n\nVerizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) as of March 21.\n\nBaron Funds said the following about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions that improve workflow efficiency through automation and digitalization. The stock rose 26.4% in the fourth quarter, finishing the year up 82.0%. Stock appreciation was supported by strong quarterly results above expectations with 24.5% year-over-year subscription revenue growth in constant currency and 30% non-GAAP operating margins despite ongoing macro complexities. In addition, the stock benefited from growing investor expectations that the company would benefit from the integration of GenAI technology into its products, and a rise in software stocks more broadly. Management noted that key business drivers included strong traction with government customers, improving momentum with new customers, and budget consolidation into platforms like ServiceNow. In addition, the company launched its GenAI-supported product line, sold under a new higher-priced Pro Plus sku, at the end of the quarter and has already signed on multiple customers with hundreds more in the pipeline. The new product line should generate material efficiencies for customers as it improves their ability to automate and digitize, and hence we expect broader adoption of the Pro Plus sku, creating an additional growth engine for ServiceNow, supporting the company\u2019s long duration of growth.\u201d\n\n11. Pfizer Inc.

(NYSE:PFE) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.\u201d\n\n10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $47.2\n\nMarket Capitalization: $175.1 billion\n\nUpside Potential: 13.5%\n\nIn the fourth quarter, 86 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), with a total stake value of $4.3 billion.\n\nOn January 26, Mizuho analysts reiterated a Buy rating and $55 price target on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a semiconductor company on our list of the most undervalued stocks.

That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel\u2019s semiconductor \u201cfabs\u201d in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.\u201d\n\n9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $137.9\n\nMarket Capitalization: $142.8 billion\n\nUpside Potential: 13.8%\n\nEagle Capital Management was the most prominent shareholder in ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) at the end of the fourth quarter, holding 13.3 million shares in the company.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts maintained a $133 price target and an Overweight rating on ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) on March 14.\n\nBased in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is an oil and gas exploration and production company.

The stock has come under pressure in recent quarters as the company has experienced a significant (and expected) decline in sales tied to pandemic-era COVID testing. However, we feel this amounts to little more than a distraction, as the core business continues to perform very well. Nothing has changed around our expectations for long-term growth, yet the stock\u2019s valuation has compressed, making for an attractive opportunity to add to the position given the long-term durable growth profile of this business.\u201d\n\n7.

        "title": "Rewards startup Fetch taps private credit boom, raising $50 million from Morgan Stanley",
        "content": "By Krystal Hu\n\nMarch 20 (Reuters) - Fetch, an app that lets consumers scan receipts to earn rewards, has raised $50 million in debt from funds managed by Morgan Stanley Private Credit, the companies told Reuters.\n\nThis funding came after Fetch turned profitable for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2023. It shows how private credit, which has seen a boom on Wall Street, become more accessible to late-stage venture capital-backed startups as they turn their focus to profitability.\n\nWes Schroll, Fetch's chief executive, said the app is used by more than 10 million monthly active households. The company positions itself as a one-stop digital loyalty and marketing platform by partnering with retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands, including General Mills and Unilever .\n\n\"We've gotten to a tipping point of the number of consumers on the platform, where I think a lot of brands have realized, by coming on Fetch, you can move the needle for your national results,\" Schroll said.\n\nBacked by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Hamilton Lane and Headline, Fetch had raised $578 million from investors in total, and was valued at more than $2.5 billion in April 2022.\n\nFetch said it had grown its revenue by more than 400% since then, without disclosing details. Headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, the company has about 850 employees.\n\nLast August, the company hired Gideon Oppenheimer, a former executive at Uber, as chief financial officer to prepare for a potential public listing. It also plans to invest in acquiring more users and expanding its partnerships across CPGs, restaurant and retailers.\n\nAshwin Krishnan, co-head of North America private credit at Morgan Stanley, said the lender does not underwrite startups based on any single metric, but rather on the quality of the business and the growth rate.\n\nAlthough most private companies his team has financed are enterprise software makers, Fetch stood out by offering a tech-enabled service that benefited both consumers and brands, Krishnan added.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York.

        "title": "Cash bonuses are down across Wall Street. But not for some top execs.",
        "content": "Cash bonuses fell across Wall Street during a challenging 2023, according to a new report, but some bosses were able to buck that trend.\n\nCash payouts for New York City securities employees dropped by an average of 2% to $176,500, according to estimates released Tuesday by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. He attributed that caution to \"market volatility\" and an influx of younger workers who pulled down the average.\n\nThe caution didn\u2019t suppress cash amounts that went to some top executives at Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks. Those bonuses were up for the CEOs of Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), according to recent filings.\n\nTwo exceptions were JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who had a cash bonus of $5 million that was unchanged, and Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, who didn\u2019t receive his bonus in cash. Dimon\u2019s overall compensation rose, while Moynihan\u2019s dropped.\n\nOther top bank executives saw their cash bonuses increase. They include three of CEO David Solomon's top lieutenants at Goldman Sachs, including chief operating officer John Waldron. His cash bonus rose 30%, to $11.26 million. John Waldron, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe past year was a challenging one across all of Wall Street as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy. In fact, it was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nA lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeals are picking up significantly compared to this time last year after a string of major deals announced in the US, including credit card lender Capital One (COF) saying it would acquire rival Discover Financial Services (DFS) for roughly $35 billion.\n\nThese pacts could mean hundreds of millions in new fees for some of the biggest banks. Morgan Stanley, Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup all had a hand in at least one of the transactions thus far in 2024.\n\nThe fortunes of these firms contribute mightily to the fortunes of New York state and New York City, DiNapoli\u2019s office said Tuesday.\n\nThe securities industry employed 198,500 workers last year in New York City, a 3.6% increase from 2022. Bonuses accounted for 7% of total tax collections for New York City in the city\u2019s 2023 fiscal year.\n\nWhile the city remains the hub of finance in the US, its share of the industry\u2019s jobs has been declining over time, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The peak was 2000, and employment is now 1.3% lower than it was that year.\n\nOther parts of the US, particularly Texas, have emerged in recent decades as huge employment centers for the finance industry. In December, Texas actually employed more finance workers than New York State, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nThe comptroller told reporters Tuesday that lower bonuses mean lower tax revenues for the state and New York City but \"there's no negative drag\" given that both government offices had anticipated larger declines in their budgets.\n\nWall Street's total cash bonus pool of $33.8 billion for 2023 was up slightly by $100 million from a year ago but down 21% from 2021 and 9% from 2020.\n\n\"We need New York to continue to be the global capital for finance because we all benefit from Wall Street when it is profitable,\" DiNapoli added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned +1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.37 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.1%. The $56.88 billion and $59.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.1% and +4.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +7.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) closed the most recent trading day at $87.96, moving -0.48% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.63%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.2%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.82%.\n\nThe the stock of investment bank has risen by 2.17% in the past month, lagging the Finance sector's gain of 2.48% and overreaching the S&P 500's gain of 1.76%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Morgan Stanley in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on April 16, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.72, showcasing a 1.18% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.53 billion, showing a 0.12% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.37 per share and a revenue of $56.88 billion, signifying shifts of +16.67% and +5.05%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher. Morgan Stanley is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Morgan Stanley has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.89 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.09.\n\nWe can additionally observe that MS currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.79. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Financial - Investment Bank industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.16.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 25, this industry ranks in the top 10% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "New Clues Strongly Suggest This Is the \"Confidential Stock\" Warren Buffett Has Been Buying",
        "content": "For nearly 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has captivated the attention of professional and retail investors by running circles around Wall Street many times over. Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an aggregate return of 4,938,103% in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on March 14. For the sake of comparison, this is 146 times greater than the aggregate total return of the S&P 500, including dividends paid, over the same period.\n\nEven though the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" won't be right all the time, his track record suggests he has a knack for finding value that's hiding in plain sight. That's why investors wait so anxiously for Berkshire Hathaway's Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Images source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's 13F is a powerful tool for investors\n\nA 13F is a required filing each quarter for institutional money managers who are overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management. As of March 14, Buffett and his team had $366 billion of invested assets spread across 45 stocks and two index funds.\n\nWhat makes 13Fs valuable is they allow investors to easily see what Wall Street's brightest and most successful money managers have been buying, selling, and holding. These filings can provide valuable insight into what stocks and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors.\n\nFor example, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs have shown that Warren Buffett and his investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been actively adding to their positions in two energy stocks: Chevron(NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Though energy stocks have historically not accounted for a sizable percentage of Berkshire's invested assets, the combination of Chevron and Occidental comprise nearly 10% of the aforementioned $366 billion portfolio.\n\nHaving this much capital put to work in two integrated oil and gas stocks is a pretty clear message that Berkshire Hathaway's brightest minds expect the spot price of oil to remain above historic norms, if not head even higher. Years of capital underinvestment during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to tight global oil supply, which is helping to lift the spot price of crude.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeing able to track the investments Warren Buffett makes has allowed investors to ride his coattails to potentially life-changing returns.\n\nNew clues emerge about the \"confidential stock\" Warren Buffett is buying\n\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway's 13F isn't telling the full story in more ways than one. In addition to Warren Buffett's company having a $621 million \"secret\" portfolio, Berkshire Hathaway has also been granted an exemption by the SEC for confidential treatment regarding one or more of its holdings.\n\nIn other words, Buffett and his team are building a position in one or more companies, and they don't want the cat to be let out of the bag while doing so. Since investors tend to pile into the stocks Buffett and his aides purchase, this confidential treatment allows Berkshire to, presumably, build its stake at a lower cost basis.\n\nBerkshire's last two quarterly 13Fs have come with this confidential treatment disclosure, which means the Oracle of Omaha and his aides have been purchasing shares of a stock, or multiple stocks, from perhaps July through December. Though I've previously thrown a dart at which mystery stock this might be, new clues point to a very specific company as Warren Buffett's \"confidential stock.\"\n\nWhile there are genuinely thousands of publicly traded companies that Buffett could, in theory, be putting his money to work in, three clues quickly narrow down the field. First, we can examine how much Berkshire Hathaway spent purchasing equity securities during the third and fourth quarters and compare this figure to the rough value of the stocks purchased during those respective quarters, as listed in Berkshire's 13Fs. In the neighborhood of $5 billion in equity security purchases is unaccounted for on a combined basis over the second-half of 2023.\n\nWhat's interesting about this figure is that Berkshire Hathaway would be required to file with the SEC once it's reached at least a 5% stake in a publicly traded company. Since there's currently no filing, it intimates that the company Buffett and his team are secretly buying has a market cap of $100 billion or more. That eliminates all but 120 publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nSecondly, Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-quarter operating results show that the company's cost basis for equity securities held in \"banks, insurance, and finance\" grew by $2.38 billion to $27.14 billion from the September-ended quarter. This cost basis grew despite Buffett and Co. selling stakes in insurers Markel Group and Globe Life. This is something my Foolish colleague Adam Levy pointed out two weeks ago, and all but ensures that Buffett's confidential stock hails from the financial sector.\n\nThere are only 24 stocks with a $100 billion or greater market cap found in the financial sector.\n\nThe third clue is that Warren Buffett loves a good deal and will stubbornly sit on his hands until he gets one. This means any stock with a relatively high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is off the table. Setting the forward P/E cap at 15 reduces the number of candidates to just 13. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's the confidential stock Berkshire Hathaway is likely buying\n\nAmong the 13 remaining financial stocks are a handful of companies Berkshire already owns, including Bank of America, American Express, and Citigroup, as well as companies that were sold within the past few quarters or years, such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo. It's highly unlikely Buffett would reenter JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, or Wells Fargo on a confidential basis, and we'd see buying activity via the 13F if it was the former three stocks Berkshire currently owns.\n\nThis leaves seven possible choices:\n\nMorgan Stanley(NYSE: MS) HSBC Holdings Royal Bank of Canada Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group(NYSE: MUFG) Toronto Dominion Bank Chubb UBS Group\n\nHaving followed Buffett's trading activity for so long, I can't recall a time when he's shown much, if any, interest in Canadian banks. Furthermore, while the Oracle of Omaha is willing to go to bat for a reclamation project in the U.S. (e.g., Bank of America in 2011), European banks aren't his cup of tea. This likely eliminates HSBC, UBS, Toronto Dominion, and Royal Bank of Canada from the discussion.\n\nTo go one step further, Berkshire's investment team just purged its portfolio of Markel and Globe Life, meaning there's probably not a big desire to pile into an internationally based insurer like Chubb.\n\nThis leaves two companies that meet what Warren Buffett is looking for: Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which is better known as \"MUFG.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley can't be ruled out as Berkshire's potential \"secret\" buy. It's valued at 12 times forward-year earnings and generates a substantial portion of its sales and profits from the company's wealth management division. In theory, wealth management should help insulate Morgan Stanley from inevitable downturns in the U.S. and global economy.\n\nBut the financial stock that makes the most sense for Buffett and his team to confidentially buy is MUFG.\n\nIn Warren Buffett's recently released annual letter to shareholders, he described the small group of companies he values as core holdings that will be held \"indefinitely.\" While Coca-Cola and American Express unsurprisingly made the list, the Oracle of Omaha touted Occidental Petroleum and the five Japanese trading houses -- Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Sumitomo, and Marubeni -- as companies he'd never sell. In fact, Buffett has upped his company's stake to around 9% in each of these Japanese trading houses. Berkshire's investment team have not hidden their belief that Japan's economy can outperform over the long run.\n\nMUFG is the largest bank by assets in Japan. More importantly, it's trading at a reasonably low forward P/E ratio of less than 12, and is valued modestly below its reported book value. High-quality banks trading below their book value have often been a lure that's attracted Buffett. Comparatively, Morgan Stanley is valued about 60% above its book value.\n\nFurthermore, MUFG is actually riding Morgan Stanley's coattails to massive profits since the financial crisis more than 15 years ago. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group purchased $9 billion worth of preferred stock in Morgan Stanley following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This stake in Morgan Stanley has consistently generated between 30% and 40% of MUFG's annual profits in recent years.\n\nWhy buy Morgan Stanley stock when Buffett can get exposure to Morgan Stanley via Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group at a fraction of the cost? I strongly believe MUFG to be the confidential stock Warren Buffett is buying at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

Drone strikes over the weekend hit multiple plants, some of them deep within the country\u2019s territory. The attacks came as Vladimir Putin swept to victory in a presidential election.\n\nCrude has broken out of its tight trading range that dominated the opening months of the year, with prices hitting the highest since November. The advance has been helped by OPEC+ cutbacks to production, and predictions for a global deficit this year. Headwinds, however, remain amid a shaky demand outlook in top importer China and persistent inflation in the US, which is muddying the path for monetary policy.\n\nCrude\u2019s latest leg higher has been accompanied by a jump in the number of outstanding contracts, known as open interest.

Back in 2022, their annual revenue was $53.67 billion, overall down a bit.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is like the big cheese in the financial world, with a massive $10 trillion of assets under their wing by the end of 2023. In January 2024, they dropped a cool $12.5 billion to snag Global Infrastructure Partners, diving into some serious alternative investments like ports and power projects worldwide.

Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Credit Card Debt\n\n1st on our list of Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s relates to credit card. Credit cards might seem like a quick fix for impulse buys, but pause for a second and think: Can you actually afford it? Will your next paycheck cover the fun splurge and your monthly bills too? Credit card companies can be slick \u2013 they thrive on your slip-ups and unnecessary spending. Watch out for those sky-high interest rates and tricky fine print that could trip you up in a flash. Stay savvy and steer clear of those credit card traps!\n\n14. Not getting Insurance\n\nHey there, when you're in your 30s, it's essential to take charge of your family's financial well-being. Your superannuation fund might have some insurance coverage, but it's crucial to figure out what YOU really need. Don't rely solely on default options \u2013 do your own research and tailor your insurance to fit your needs. Keep in mind that if you switch jobs and funds, you could lose your insurance, and getting new coverage might cost you more. Here's the kicker: getting long-term disability insurance is way cheaper in your 30s than later in life. So, if you're young and healthy, now's the time to lock in that personal insurance. Waiting until you're older or dealing with health issues could mean paying more or even getting turned down for coverage. Take control of your financial safety net now \u2013 your future self will thank you!\n\n13. Getting carried away with kids\u2019 expenses\n\nGetting carried away with kids' expenses is 13th on our list of Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s.\n\nSo, when you're in your 30s and you've got a little one running around, it's totally natural to want the best for them. But hey, watch out for that urge to splurge on all the fancy baby gear. Before you know it, your cash could vanish into a cloud of toys and gizmos. Take a second to think: does your tiny tot really need that high-end accessory? Maybe it's smarter to instead stash that cash in an investment or savings account or use it to tackle any debts you have. Keep those emotions in check and make sure your spending matches your financial goals \u2013 for you and your little bundle of joy!\n\n12. Carrying Too Much High-Interest Debt\n\nWhen you're in your 30s, watch out for that sneaky consumer debt trap. Debts may seem all fun and easy, but they can lead to a spending spree that's totally out of control. It's way too easy to grab an asset on instalments and forget how much you're losing out on the opportunity to save and build money.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: those minimum monthly payments might seem handy, but they come at a cost. Many folks don't even realize the interest rates piling up, turning that $1,000 splurge into a $1,180 headache if you don't pay it off in full. Yikes!\n\nIf you're drowning in debt, focus on wiping out the highest interest balances first or think about consolidating to a no-interest card to tackle that debt monster. The key? Stay on top of your debt game and don't let those balances spiral out of control!\n\n11. Not keeping track of your spending\n\n11th on our list of Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s is reckless spending patterns. In your 30s, it's key to watch where your cash is flowing. Mindless spending can really chip away at your wealth over time. Stick to spending less than you earn \u2013 that's the secret sauce to building up your bank balance. Keep an eye on your spending habits, track every penny for a month, and see where you can cut back. Avoid lifestyle creep \u2013 that temptation to spend more when you earn more. Instead, focus on striking a balance between enjoying life and saving for the future. Oh, and forget about keeping up with the Joneses \u2013 it's about knowing your own financial groove. Keep tabs on your spending and build your financial game plan, one wise move at a time!\n\n10. Lifestyle inflation\n\nIn your 30s, when the cash starts flowing, it's easy for those wants to match up with your growing income. But here's the deal: treat your savings like a non-negotiable bill you gotta pay. Set up automated savings to keep on track and steer clear of splurging on unnecessary stuff just to keep up appearances. Don't sweat trying to keep pace with others \u2013 make thoughtful spending choices based on your needs. Stick to your financial plan and watch those savings grow!\n\n9. Trying to Compete\n\nHey, one money mistake to avoid in your 30s is falling into the \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses\u201d trap. It's all about social comparison bias \u2013 peeking at what others have and feeling the pressure to keep pace. But listen, your journey is totally unique. Comparing yourself to family or friends could push you to crave things you're not quite ready for. Remember, everyone's financial situation is different \u2013 from incomes to obligations. Stay focused on your own path and trust that good planning will get you where you want to be. Enjoy the ride and stay true to your own financial goals!\n\n8. Saying no to taking risk in career\n\nHey there in your 30s! If you're not feeling the love for your job or see stagnant growth ahead, it might be time for a career switch. You've got experience under your belt, making you a hot commodity in the job market. Update that resume, explore new opportunities, and get ready to negotiate for a bump in pay and more responsibility. It's your chance to gear up for your top earning years. When weighing new job offers, look beyond just the salary. Check out the benefits package \u2013 from health insurance to retirement plans. Think about perks like working remotely, flexible hours, or even a car allowance. Your full compensation package, including those benefits, is what really counts.\n\n7. Taking on Additional Student Debt\n\nOpting for student debt is another mistake in our list of Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s.\n\nThinking about heading back to school for another degree in your 30s? It's a big decision, so here are a few things to consider. If furthering your education is essential for your career growth or a career shift, it may be a no-brainer to pursue it. However, if you're contemplating additional schooling just to spruce up your resume or boost your LinkedIn profile, pause and reflect on a couple of key factors.\n\nFirstly, weigh the Opportunity Cost of Not Working: Can you afford to put your career on hold for a while to focus on your studies? Consider if the potential post-grad salary will compensate for the income you might miss out on during your academic pursuits.\n\nSecondly, think about Debt: Taking out student loans for graduate school can be a tempting option, but be mindful of the higher interest rates that accompany such loans and the immediate repayment demands post-graduation.\n\nDon't underestimate the financial commitments and challenges that could come after earning that additional degree. Keep these aspects in mind as you weigh the pros and cons of going back to school for further education in your 30s.\n\n6. Not caring about post-retirement needs\n\nHey, in your 30s, don't snooze on saving for retirement! Experts always stress the importance of starting early to build that nest egg, aiming for the hefty $1.7 million that folks believe is the magic number by age 65. As Kaleb Paddock, a financial planner, points out, compound interest is your BFF in your 30s. Even small bucks stashed away now can snowball into big savings over time. Unlike simple interest, compound interest multiplies your earnings on your existing returns, helping your money grow faster the longer it stays invested in retirement accounts like a 401(k) or Roth IRA. Time's a powerful friend when it comes to building that retirement fund, so make every moment count!\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about 5 Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nTop 15 Financial Gurus to Learn From 12 Most Important Financial Ratios to Analyze a Company 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Money Mistakes to Avoid in Your 30s is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley won a court fight to overturn \u20ac1.4 million ($1.5 million) in deferred bonus payments given to a managing director who sued for the award after he quit to join one of his biggest clients.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSpaceX Starship Nears Orbit, But Is Lost Before Return to Earth Millennium Trader Scored $40 Million Windfall in Egypt FX Plunge Biden\u2019s Best Shot Against Trump Lies in \u2018Blue Wall\u2019 States Putin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for Russia Bond Yields Jump as Hot Inflation Curbs Fed Wagers: Markets Wrap\n\nThe Paris court of appeals ruled against Bernard Mourad, saying the bank\u2019s cash and shares incentive programs \u201csought to ensure his loyalty in the long term.\u201d The judges said they were distinct from his performance compensation \u2014 covered by his salary and discretionary bonus.\n\nAs such, Morgan Stanley was allowed to make the disbursement of the deferred pay conditional on his employment at the bank at a given date \u201cwithout this constituting an unjustified and disproportionate restriction on the freedom to work,\u201d the judges ruled.\n\nThe dispute has put the spotlight on a practice rarely challenged by leavers who often prefer to forgo deferred bonuses to avoid undue scrutiny as they start new jobs. In France, similar lawsuits have cropped up in recent years against BNP Paribas SA, Edmond de Rothschild and consultancy Bain & Co.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment beyond welcoming the decision. Mourad\u2019s attorney declined to immediately comment. Still, the outcome isn\u2019t likely to be final as the dispute is expected to go all the way to France\u2019s top court.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley Fights $1.5 Million Bonuses to Banker Who Quit\n\nDuring hearings in the case, Mourad\u2019s lawyer, Eric Manca, has argued that the deferred bonuses were explicitly linked to performance and said France\u2019s top court prohibits requiring an employee to stay on in order to receive staggered payments for work he or she has already done.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Morgan Stanley\u2019s claim that Mourad tacitly accepted of the rules governing the incentive programs that held sway with judges. The court of appeals on Thursday highlighted that Mourad had received emails and logged on nearly 100 times to a website detailing conditions for the company\u2019s deferred bonus plan.\n\nThe judges concluded that Mourad \u201cwasn\u2019t unaware\u201d of the impact quitting would have. It made him \u201close his rights\u201d to amounts the court considered hadn\u2019t been vested when he resigned \u2014 nearly \u20ac1.2 million in shares and \u20ac250,000 for another bonus.\n\nRegular Grievance\n\nEmployment laws in France have become a regular grievance among Wall Street banks operating in the country. The issue has only become more prevalent since they started moving staff in Paris post-Brexit.\n\nAt a conference last month, the co-head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s Paris office urged \u201cmore flexibility\u201d after describing France\u2019s labor market as \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\nAs part of its legal dispute with Mourad, Morgan Stanley\u2019s team argued that his initial win in 2019 \u201cimpacts France\u2019s entire banking sector\u201d and \u201ccauses concern at state level.\u201d They said the case \u201cgoes beyond the interests of Mourad and Morgan Stanley France.\u201d\n\nMourad left the US bank nearly a decade ago to join telecom mogul Patrick Drahi. He didn\u2019t stay long at Altice Media and has worn many different caps since. He had a role in Emmanuel Macron\u2019s winning presidential campaign in 2017 and did a short stint at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Paris.\n\n(Updates with details on ruling starting in sixth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them America\u2019s Plumber Deficit Isn\u2019t Good for the Economy Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?

        "title": "ECB Unveils Policy Revamp, Locking In Floor System for Rates",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank presented a new framework for how it implements monetary policy, preserving the current system of steering interest rates while giving lenders more of a say over how much cash they need to operate.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets Wrap Ex-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary China Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US Wheat United Tells Boeing to Stop Making Its Long Delayed Max 10s Trump Wins Republican Nomination, Setting Up Rematch With Biden\n\nThe revamp of the plumbing that underpins the ECB\u2019s key task of maintaining stable prices in the 20-nation euro zone will also see officials use a permanent portfolio of bonds to provide liquidity. While no timeline was given for shifting to the new setup, the process will be protracted due to the large amount of money still in the system from past stimulus drives.\n\nThe ECB said in late 2022 that it would revamp its so-called operational framework as the rate hikes that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ended years of ultra-low \u2014 and at times negative \u2014 borrowing costs, alongside mass bond purchases to flood banks with money to perk up the region\u2019s lackluster economy.\n\nThe review acknowledges the \u201csignificant changes in the financial system and monetary policy in recent years,\u201d President Christine Lagarde said in a statement. \u201cThe framework will ensure that our policy implementation remains effective, robust, flexible and efficient.\u201d\n\nHere are the main announcements from the ECB:\n\nFormalization of floor system, under which the lowest of the ECB\u2019s three policy rates is the key lever to shift short-term borrowing costs Existing bond holdings to continue running off but ECB will provide liquidity through a new structural portfolio Refinancing operations to play central role in ensuring banks have sufficient cash Spread between the deposit rate and the main refinancing rate to be narrowed to 15 basis points \u2014 from 50 currently \u2014 on Sept. 18\n\nThis will be done by reducing the MRO by 35 basis points Minimum reserve requirements for commercial lenders to stay at 1% but may still be adjusted down the line To read the ECB\u2019s announcement, click here\n\nStory continues\n\nWith huge amounts of excess cash still sloshing around, any immediate market reaction is likely to be muted. The changes announced Wednesday also have no immediate implications for monetary policy, which has been tightened at an unprecedented pace to quell inflation.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s deposit rate has been at a record 4% since September \u2014 even as the region\u2019s economy endured more than a year of stagnation. As inflation sinks toward the 2% target, however, cuts are expected to start in June.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nBefore the Great Financial Crisis, the ECB used a so-called corridor system that tightly managed aggregate cash levels at financial institutions \u2014 providing money as needed through weekly auctions and relying on lenders to distribute the funds among themselves.\n\nThe main refinancing rate was the starting point for how much banks paid through these auctions. The deposit and marginal-lending facilities acted as the corridor\u2019s floor and ceiling for parking cash and borrowing.\n\nThe setup was upended, however, as the European debt crisis that followed the 2008 crash paved the way for quantitative easing \u2014 huge purchases of bonds that negated the need for the auctions and left the deposit rate as the main policy lever.\n\nAs officials reduce the ECB\u2019s balance sheet and strive to wean lenders off abundant central-bank liquidity, they\u2019ve decided to formalize this system.\n\n\u201cShort-term money-market interest rates are expected to evolve in the vicinity of the deposit facility rate with tolerance for some volatility as long as it doesn\u2019t blur the signal about the intended monetary-policy stance,\u201d the ECB said Wednesday.\n\nBond Holdings\n\nThe ECB still holds about \u20ac4.7 trillion ($5.1 trillion) of securities that it bought to counter Europe\u2019s debt woes and the economic effects of the pandemic.\n\nTo reduce its footprint in the market as these crises fade, it\u2019s already allowing these assets to roll off its balance sheet as they mature and has expedited the return of separate cheap, long-term loans handed out directly to banks.\n\nUnwinding these holdings, however, would risk eventually distorting the mechanism the ECB uses to battle inflation \u2014 which is why the framework review was launched.\n\nIn the future, policymakers want to use a separate, structural asset portfolio to meet some of the financial system\u2019s liquidity needs \u2014 as such, differing in purpose from the existing Asset Purchase Program and Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program. The new portfolio, which will inject cash without tying up collateral that\u2019s proved scarce in recent years, will contain bonds with shorter maturities and may seek to help the ECB achieve its climate goals.\n\nThe ECB didn\u2019t say when the new system will begin.\n\nLending Operations\n\nMain refinancing operations are expected to play a central role in supplying banks\u2019 marginal liquidity needs, with requests to tap the facility to be met in full. With that in mind, the ECB will reduce the difference between its main refinancing rate and the deposit rate by 15 basis points from Sept. 18.\n\n\u201cThis narrower spread will incentivize bidding in the weekly operations, so that short-term money-market rates are likely to evolve in the vicinity of the deposit facility rate,\u201d the ECB said. \u201cAt the same time, it will leave room for money-market activity and provide incentives for banks to seek market-based funding solutions.\u201d\n\nAs well as MROs, the ECB said liquidity will be provided through three-month longer-term refinancing operations as well as \u2013 at a later stage \u2013 structural longer-term credit operations.\n\nStrategists broadly expect the easy access to liquidity through lending facilities to suppress volatility, and help ensure money market rates stay anchored to policy rates.\n\nThe marginal lending facility will stay 25 basis points above the main refinancing rate.\n\nMinimum Reserves\n\nOfficials decided not to increase minimum reserve requirements for commercial lenders \u2014 in line with a report by Bloomberg earlier this week.\n\nBanks must currently hold 1% of certain liabilities \u2014 mostly customer deposits \u2014 at the ECB. Raising that threshold would have reduced interest costs for the euro zone\u2019s 20 national central banks, which are paying the 4% deposit rate on excess reserves \u2014 triggering steep losses at many.\n\nHawks like Austria\u2019s Robert Holzmann had floated the idea of boosting the ratio to between 5% and 10% \u2014 a proposal that bank lobbyists greeted with alarm and warnings that lending would suffer.\n\nBank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos had said further action \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem obvious to me.\u201d Belgian\u2019s Pierre Wunsch had also observed that he doesn\u2019t see \u201cany strong arguments\u201d in favor of lifting minimum reserves.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe ECB said the Governing Council plans to review the \u201ckey parameters\u201d of the new framework in 2026, while standing ready to make adjustments earlier if required.\n\nIt also intends to conduct an \u201cin-depth analysis of the design of the new longer-term refinancing operations and the new structural portfolio,\u201d though it didn\u2019t provide details as to when that may happen.\n\n\u201cAs financial markets, institutions and counterparties adapt to changes in the liquidity environment alongside the reduciton of the Eurosystem balance sheet, the Governing Council will carefully monitor the evolution and distribution of excess liquidity, the formation of money-market rates, the evolution of banks\u2019 demand for reserves, and the functioning of money markets an dbroader financial markets within the parameters announced today,\u201d the ECB said.\n\n--With assistance from Mark Schroers and Alice Gledhill.\n\n(Updates with more detail in Lending Operations section.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom Luxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls How Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy as the Gig Economy Continues to Expand",
        "content": "The gig economy has grown by leaps and bounds over the past several years. Moving ahead, there\u2019s a good chance the American gig economy could continue to grow at a rate outpacing that of the overall labor force. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to imagine, but gig work could continue to outpace traditional work as younger generations embrace the new way of work.\n\nThough regulations to protect gig workers are sure to introduce some turbulence to the gig economy, I think few things can stop it in its tracks despite setbacks, such as lacking (or limited) benefits and uncertainties regarding hours and pay.\n\nAs an investor, there are more than a handful of ways to profit from the fast-growing gig economy. In this piece, we\u2019ll outline three gig economy stocks that stand to benefit as the sector expands further.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDoorDash (DASH) Doge Dash game logo\n\nSource: dogedash.com\n\nFood delivery platform DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) has been on the rise over the past year, more than doubling over the timespan as demand for quick eats has heated up. In the latest quarter, DASH stock suffered a bit of a setback, falling modestly following the release of some \u201cmixed\u201d results.\n\nAt the time of writing, DASH stock is down a mere 3.3%. Still, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) views any such dips as great buying opportunities as the food-delivery heavyweight looks to reap the benefits from recent efforts. DoorDash continues growing its user base while doing its best to get them to spend more. The company may have what it takes to dash past Morgan Stanley\u2019s $145.00 per-share price target.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the improving environment that bodes well for the food-delivery firm; the firm seems poised to make a nice profitability push. If it\u2019s able to manage costs without hurting growth, DoorDash stock is a gig economy top dog to stick with.\n\nLyft (LYFT) lyft stock\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nLyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is a $7.1 billion underdog in the ride-hailing scene. And though LYFT stock has endured a brutal fall from grace, they have been showing signs of life of late. It more than doubled over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last week, Lyft stock received another analyst upgrade following improved results under the leadership of its new CEO, David Risher. I think the best is yet to come for a firm with a ton of ground to gain in the ride-hailing market.\n\nRecently, RBC Capital Markets\u2019 Brad Erickson raised the possibility that DoorDash partnering with Lyft is a move that could \u201ccreate significant value for both [firms].\u201d I think he\u2019s right. A potential Dash-Lyft relationship would help even the playing field a bit with transportation kingpin Uber (NYSE:UBER), which has been a dominant force in mobility and food delivery.\n\nTo me, a DASH-LYFT partnership just makes sense. Who knows? If it works out, perhaps it could lay the groundwork for an acquisition.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo on a phone screen on a blue background. Phone is in a little cart and there are packages around them. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nFinally, we have Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), a gig economy play I most fondly view. Shares of the homemade-focused e-commerce platform have been crushed in recent years, now down more than 75% from their peak. Though the firm has significant challenges to tackle, I see considerable value in it as it looks to turn a corner after its latest quarterly earnings miss.\n\nWith consumers in a tough spot, your average Etsy-focused gig has been put in a difficult position. Still, the consumer won\u2019t be short on disposable income forever. Further, Etsy could certainly profit profoundly as it embraces generative AI tech to help consumers discover gifts they didn\u2019t even know they wanted.\n\nIndeed, when one wanders over to Etsy, many aren\u2019t quite sure what treasures they\u2019ll find. AI can help give merchants a shot in the arm as they look to better tailor the platform for the AI age. At just 32 times trailing price-to-earnings, perhaps ETSY stock seems too cheap for a firm that stands to gain so much at the hands of AI innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 oil stocks with the biggest upside. If you want to skip our overview of the oil sector and some recent news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nWhen we talk about investing in major sectors of the stock market, such as oil stocks, the number of equities that are available for trading on major indexes runs into the hundreds. This means that selecting the right stocks to invest in becomes a tedious process that requires an investor to patiently work through copious amounts of financial data to see whether a share price is justified by a firm's underlying models.\n\nNaturally, this is why the finance industry exists, with the sell side sector hiring teams to analyze stocks and write recommendations. Some such firms include banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). These banks issue hundreds of stock notes each year, and often formulate lists of top firms in sectors such as oil to narrow down potential star stock performers.\n\nOil stocks in particular have been at the center of news coverage for the past couple of years, and despite significant demand up and downswings in the sector, their long term returns still resemble those that are characteristic of stable sectors. For instance, when we look at the five year performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index, the index is up by 16%, a growth that discounts the effects of dividends in providing investors a larger bang for their buck.\n\nIn fact for the oil industry, even though 2023 was a boon in terms of revenue and high profits due to elevated gas prices stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it saw a sector that was still reeling from the effects of post pandemic global shutdowns and travel restrictions. These had ensured that the demand for oil was cut down significantly, and as the implications became clear, the same S&P oil index that is up by 16% over the past five years dropped by more than 30% over the course of a single summer month.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust before this turmoil hit, i.e. in June 2022, Goldman Sachs had started to share its favored oil stocks which the bank's analyst Neil Mehta outlined had the potential for the greatest share price upside. The list was accompanied by a note that identified companies slated to benefit from a boom in global commodity demand and prices right when the global energy industry was undergoing a significant re shift on the supply side and fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) boomed as an alternative to cheap Russian gas.\n\nMehta explained that the list of companies his teams had identified carried the potential of generating strong cash flows and potentially experiencing significant upside revisions down the road. He added that in case of long term crude oil prices hovering around $90, the top oil stocks could provide attractive valuations and end up being important components of a beta barbell investing strategy that allows an investor to focus on high and low risk stocks to strike an adequate balance between hedging a portfolio and seeking return.\n\nSince then, Goldman Sachs has mostly stuck with its oil price forecast, which is important since the high cash flow companies that the analyst identified are said to be capable of using stable prices to generate high cash flow. Cash flow is the actual money that is available to a firm for its operations and investor returns, and the bank's latest oil price forecast sits at $87 after a $2 raise in February 2024.\n\nWith the outlook of oil still rosy despite a slow Chinese recovery, we decided to look at the top oil stocks with the biggest upside. Some notable picks are Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD). 13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\nAn oil derrick in the North Sea, revealing the scope of the company's drilling operations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the oil stocks with the highest upside, we ranked Goldman Sachs's top oil stock picks in 2022 and 2024 by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in 2023's December quarter. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund shareholders were chosen as the oil stocks with the highest upside. For the oil stocks from 2022, the share price performance from March 2022 is shared.\n\nFor these oil stocks with the largest upside, we used we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\n13. Magnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:MGY)\n\nNumber of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25\n\nShare Price Performance Since March 2022: -4.22%\n\nMagnolia Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:MGY) is a small American oil exploration firm headquartered in Houston, Texas.

(NYSE:KOS) is an American oil and gas company with exploration projects in the U.S. and other countries. Its shares have been on a roller coaster trajectory since March 2022, and while the stock has soared by as much as 45% during this period, over the long term it is still down by roughly 6%.\n\nAs of Q4 2023 end, 62 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought and owned a stake in Kosmos Energy Ltd.

(NYSE:OVV) produces oil in several American states and Canadian provinces. While the stock was quick to recover most of its 2022 losses in the next couple of months, a sell off that took place in July 2023 after it announced a $250 million asset sale is yet to reverse itself.\n\nInsider Monkey scoured through 933 hedge fund holdings for last year's fourth quarter and found that 35 had invested in Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV). Michael Rockefeller and Karl Kroeker's Woodline Partners was the biggest investor since it held a $136 million stake.\n\n10.

A somewhat diversified firm, it is involved in producing oil and gas and transporting it as well. Not only are the shares up by 36.75% since March 2022, but this doesn't capture the full return as Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) also pays a $2 dividend for a 4.5% yield.\n\nInsider Monkey's fourth quarter of 2023 survey covered 933 hedge funds and found 42 Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) shareholders.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share, indicating a change of +1.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.37 points to a change of +16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.88 billion and $59.53 billion estimates indicate +5.1% and +4.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +7.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee and Tatiana Bautzer\n\n(Reuters) - An error by S&P Dow Jones Indices may have contributed to volatility in shares of Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, PNC Financial Services Group and other stocks in recent days, traders said.\n\nAt issue was a list of pending changes to the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index that S&P Dow Jones Indices released late on March 1, naming 10 companies slated for addition to the index and two for deletion. The changes were to take effect on March 18.\n\nA total of 23 stocks were affected by the changes, according to trading desk notes obtained by Reuters.\n\nA S&P spokeperson said an unspecified error led to the wrong names being provided to clients.\n\nS&P Dow Jones issued a replacement pro forma list with a total of 11 additions and three deletions after the market's close on Tuesday.\n\nMorgan Stanley and PNC were among the companies that were to be added to the index on the original list.\n\nTheir shares rose on Monday, but gave back those gains on Wednesday. By contrast, shares of Pfizer, which were slated for deletion on the initial list, fell on Monday but rose on Wednesday when the revisions were published and it was clear that it would remain in the index.\n\nTrading volumes for all three companies were 50% to 80% higher than their 90-day averages this week.\n\nMorgan Stanley and PNC declined to comment. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is not that common an occurrence,\" said Bryan Armour, an analyst at Morningstar who tracks exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe error triggered a scramble on trading desks to help their own clients unwind trades made in anticipation of what proved to be incorrect upcoming changes, traders said.\n\nThe Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index is designed to offer investors a benchmark composed of stocks in companies with strong fundamentals and a record of paying high dividends consistently. It is used by some index funds to build portfolios.\n\nSome traders also seek to buy on announcements of upcoming changes before they take effect and any asset management firms using it as a benchmark must adjust their own portfolios.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jamie Freed)",

The slip up was flagged to S&P which sent out an updated notice on Tuesday removing those companies.\n\n\u201cS&P Dow Jones indices identified and corrected an error in the preliminary reconstitution data for the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and sent updated pro-forma data to customers on March 5,\u201d a spokesperson for S&P said. The index itself was not impacted, according to the spokesperson.\n\nA representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A representative for Northern Trust didn\u2019t have an immediate comment and representatives for PNC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMorgan Stanley and PNC saw their stocks swing on both Monday and Wednesday while trading volumes for both soared to more than double their daily average over the last five years on both those days. By mid-day trading on Thursday, Northern Trust was the top KBW Bank Index gainer. Morgan Stanley was up slightly.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe banks\u2019 inclusion in the index would likely prompt some funds that use it as a benchmark to add those shares, so the buying on Monday may have been traders trying to get ahead of that move. Similarly, that could have prompted selling days later as the error became known.\n\nIndexes are subject to regular rebalancing exercises to make sure their members remain representative of market trends and meet certain criteria. Inclusion in equity indexes tracking market themes like income investing can boost a company\u2019s profile and add trading liquidity.\n\nWith this particular Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index, S&P rejigs its constituents annually in March. The preliminary results of that reconstitution process are circulated around market participants for about two weeks. During that time, they can provide feedback and prepare for the changes to go into effect \u2014 which this year is March 18.\n\nThe index returned 2.04% this year through Feb. 29, according to its website. It comprises 100 companies with industrial firms accounting for the largest portion, followed by health care and financial companies.\n\n--With assistance from Bre Bradham, Matt Turner, Felice Maranz, Sridhar Natarajan, Isabelle Lee and Emily Graffeo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World\u2019s Most Coveted Office Chair How Microsoft\u2019s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing\u2019s Great Firewall Humanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing\u2019s Expense\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley (MS) Axes China Unit Staff Amid Market Failure",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley MS has axed 9% of its employees at its asset management business unit in China as part of its broader plans to stay defensive amid the nation\u2019s economic slowdown and market uncertainties. The news was reported by Reuters, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe job cuts started in December 2023. These have impacted almost 15 of Morgan Stanley Investment Management China\u2019s employees to date.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that MS has reduced headcount in its China fund unit since buying out its local partner\u2019s 36% stake for $54 million in 2023 and rebranding the unit as a wholly-owned subsidiary in June.\r\n\r\nAccording to company disclosures, Morgan Stanley Investment Management China\u2019s assets under management have declined every quarter after reaching a peak in June 2021, resulting in a 53% decline by 2023 end.\r\n\r\nBased on the earnings results of its ex-joint venture partner Huaxin Securities, the unit recorded an operating loss of 48.5 million yuan in 2022 and 23.2 million yuan in the first half of 2023.\r\n\r\nIn order to drive the unit, Morgan Stanley hired a chief investment officer, Alex Zhou, at the China unit for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe staff reductions and the hiring of Zhou are part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management China\u2019s efforts to modify and revise the business after taking full ownership.\r\n\r\nNotably, China\u2019s prolonged economic sickness has resulted in a collapse of its stock markets, which has diminished prospects for its $3.8-trillion fund sector.\r\n\r\nLast month, the benchmark CSI 300 index, which replicates the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, fell to five-year lows after sinking 11% in 2023. The China stock markets have been hit by the unparalleled debt crisis in the property sector and a lack of large-scale government stimulus.\r\n\r\nTwo decades after betting on China as the world\u2019s biggest growth story, investors are pulling back billions of dollars from China\u2019s actively managed equities funds.\r\n\r\nRecently, the sentiment in the nation\u2019s stock market has improved a bit after Beijing took measures to support the market and address the underlying economic issues. It has sought to put a floor under the share prices by pushing state-controlled funds to buy stocks, curbing short-selling and trading misbehaviors.\r\n\r\nWhile the stimulus might result in some growth in the economy, a full stock market recovery requires a more forceful response to the property crisis.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore Job Cuts by Morgan Stanley?\n\nLast month, the Wall Street Journal reported that MS planned to lay off hundreds of workers from its wealth management (WM) division, a move that is expected to impact less than 1% of the unit\u2019s employees.\r\n\r\nThe move came as the investment banking giant, like several other Wall Street firms, seeks to reduce costs amid economic uncertainty and concerns regarding the trajectory of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley has been focusing more on its WM segment and less on the institutional securities segment (constituting trading and investment banking) over the past few years. This is because the WM segment is less dependent on the capital markets and is a less volatile revenue source.\r\n\r\nThe WM segment became an important profit-making unit for MS post the acquisitions of Eaton Vance and E*Trade Financial under former CEO James Gorman.\r\n\r\nHowever, last year, the segment\u2019s revenues were flat year over year.\r\n\r\nThe job cuts will be one of the first major moves by Morgan Stanley\u2019s newly appointed CEO, Ted Pick.\r\n\r\nOver the past six months, MS shares have gained almost 1% compared with the industry\u2019s 13.2% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nSimilar Moves by Other Finance Firms\n\nLast month, CNBC reported that Citigroup C is planning to reduce 51 job roles across its wealth segment in London. The move will likely affect 10% of its wealth segment workforce, comprising 485 employees.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the job roles being eliminated would range from the post of assistant vice president to the director level. The elimination is likely to involve 21 job roles in C\u2019s private bank division.\r\n\r\nThe decision to eliminate job positions in the wealth segment comes as Citigroup aims to boost the unit\u2019s returns after discouraging results witnessed in the last reported quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the segment\u2019s efficiency ratio rose to 99% from 92% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nA chief operating officer of Citigroup stated, \u201cThe wealth business is continuing to identify areas to improve efficiency through structural changes and cost base reductions.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn January, it came to light that BlackRock BLK was planning to eliminate 600 jobs, accounting for 3% of the company\u2019s total global workforce. The move is part of BLK\u2019s efforts to streamline operations and adapt to a rapidly changing operating environment.\r\n\r\nDespite the elimination, BlackRock remains positive about its growth prospects. By the end of 2024, the company expects to employ more workforce as it plans to expand certain parts of its business.\r\n\r\nIn a memo to its staff, BLK\u2019s CEO Larry Fink and president Rob Kapito wrote, \u201cWe see our industry changing faster than at any time since the founding of BlackRock. And, perhaps most profound, new technologies are poised to transform our industry \u2013 and every other industry.\u201d\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Big banks are getting what they want from Washington",
        "content": "Big banks have been pressing US regulators to reconsider a controversial rule requiring them to hold greater buffers against future losses, and this week they got what they wanted.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jay Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg both said Thursday they anticipate changes to the rule following pushback from lenders, community groups, Republicans and even some Democrats.\n\nPowell told Senate lawmakers that \"I expect there will be material and broad changes,\" and \"we won\u2019t hesitate\" to re-propose the rule if that makes sense \u2014 repeating a point he made to House lawmakers Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a Senate committee Thursday. REUTERS/Tom Brenner (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGruenberg told reporters separately that \"I certainly think we anticipate making changes in the final rule based on the extensive comments that we've received.\"\n\nThe concerns about the capital rule \u2014 the most aggressive change to how banks are regulated since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 range from harm it could do to the US economy to ways in which it would reduce access to mortgages for disadvantaged home buyers.\n\nThe willingness of regulators to change what they already proposed highlights the increased sway that big banks have in Washington, a sharp contrast to the harsh political scrutiny they received in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"We also see this as potentially marking an important inflection point whereby the regulatory burden levied on the largest banks\" after the 2008 crisis \"could be nearing a peak,\" Ebrahim Poonawala, a bank analyst for Bank of America, said in a note this week.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday accused Powell of flip-flopping on tougher capital rules after pledging last year to be more aggressive with supervision following the failures of several mid-sized lenders such as Silicon Valley Bank. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\n\"You have gone weak kneed on this,\" she told Powell during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.\n\nPowell said the capital rule \u2014 known as Basel 3 \u2014 is not directly related to what happened to Silicon Valley Bank and that the Fed is taking other steps to heighten supervision of specific banks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou will see I am doing exactly what I said I would do,\u201d Powell said.\n\nAt issue are higher capital requirements that were unveiled last summer by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. Those requirements focused on the amount of capital that banks must have in reserve to protect themselves from insolvency.\n\nRegulators have said the proposal would result in a 16% increase in capital levels and a 20% increase in risk-weighted assets for big banks.\n\nIn the months since, the banks have launched a campaign to roll back the new rules \u2014 or scrap them entirely. Many banks submitted letters to the Fed listing the many problems they have with the rules ahead of a deadline for those comments that ended Tuesday.\n\nThe banks have contemplated suing if the rules don\u2019t get changed. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum openly discussed that possibility with reporters in January.\n\nSuing the bank\u2019s own regulator \"is never a preferred option,\" he said, but \"it can\u2019t be taken off the table.\"\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, a trade group representing JPMorgan and other big banks, has reportedly hired a lawyer to prepare a lawsuit if the rules don\u2019t get changed, according to a report by Semafor.\n\nOne big bank lobbyist, Financial Services Forum President and CEO Kevin Fromer, said he was \"encouraged\" by Powell\u2019s assurances this week.\n\n\"We agree, broad and material changes are needed to the proposal to avoid significant harm to the economy, businesses of every size and American households,\" he said.\n\n\"To achieve that, we continue to believe that a re-proposal is the best approach to giving the public a well-justified and data-based rule that is consistent with the plans of other jurisdictions.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "If picking the top tech stocks with potential was easy, we\u2019d all have a portfolio full of surprising breakout stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t that easy. But that doesn\u2019t mean finding tech stocks with potential is hard, either.\n\nToday\u2019s economic and interest rate climate means tech stocks with potential aren\u2019t just prioritizing growth at all costs. Instead, tech stocks with potential leverage growth and market share while combining both with prudent financial management. At the same time, each of these three stocks offers unique, company-specific tailwinds set to propel them higher over the coming year.\n\nTrip.com Group (TCOM) Trip.com Group logo on a smartphone. TCOM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nTourism plays a critical role in China\u2019s economy, and Trip.com Group (NASDAQ:TCOM) is uniquely positioned among tech stocks with potential, benefiting from long-term growth in the sector. After a rough few years, Trip.com is poised to benefit significantly from the end of China\u2019s Zero-Covid policies. Bottom line: 2023\u2019s economic initiatives are expected to lead to a mild cyclical recovery in China in 2024, pushing tourism rates higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrip.com serves as a comprehensive platform for ticketing, hotel bookings and travel planning, catering to over half of China\u2019s tourism market. Before the pandemic, China\u2019s international tourism was on an upward trajectory, with 154.63 million international outbound tourists in 2019. That number plummeted to just 20.33 million in 2020 due to the pandemic. However, the sector has shown signs of recovery; by the first half of 2023, over 40 million tourists had ventured abroad from China. Although these numbers are still well below pre-pandemic figures, the quick rebound following the cessation of the Zero-Covid policy and an anticipated economic turnaround positions Trip.com as a leading contender for this year\u2019s top international tech stock.\n\nFabrinet (FN) a picture concept of network cables\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN) is firmly within the tech stocks with potential arena, matching Nvidia in terms of AI-driven business focus and remarkable growth, boasting a surge of over 80% in the past year. It\u2019s important to note that Fabrinet is a key supplier to Nvidia, the semiconductor behemoth, playing a crucial role in the competitive race for AI supremacy. While Nvidia and its rivals compete at the forefront of the AI \u201cgold rush,\u201d Fabrinet ensures its profitability by providing essential components needed in the industry, securing its success regardless of the market leader.\n\nThe company specializes in producing and supplying optical cables, which are critical for data transmission across various hardware platforms at unparalleled speeds exceeding 800GB per second. These cables are pivotal for the development of machine learning and AI technologies. Remarkably, this particular line of products contributes $500 million to Fabrinet\u2019s revenue, underlining its significance to the company\u2019s financial health. The outlook for Fabrinet\u2019s growth is incredibly strong, with projections suggesting that its operational income could double shortly.\n\nMoreover, with a valuation of just 2.9x sales and 31x earnings, Fabrinet presents an attractive investment opportunity. The global economic environment is improving, and technology firms continue prioritizing AI development. To that end, Fabrinet stands ready to emerge as one of the standout tech stocks with potential in 2024.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading analysts from Citi (NYSE:C), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) are identifyingArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) as a standout stock with potential in the AI sector despite it flying under the radar compared to more high-profile tech stocks. That dynamic will likely change in 2024, as the company capitalizes on expanding cloud and AI opportunities. Citi\u2019s Atif Malik particularly emphasized Arista\u2019s potential to benefit from the generative AI megatrend and various early AI-related opportunities.\n\nArista\u2019s stock experienced stagnation after an earnings report that delivered subdued guidance, causing a temporary dip before a modest recovery last month.

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 25 most indebted companies in the world in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion about interest rates and corporate debt, go to the 9 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2024.\n\nInterest rates are expected to go down this year, but the Federal Reserve recently indicated that it will be a while before that happens. The Fed President, Raphael Bostic recently highlighted that the risk of inflation may get stuck above the central bank's 2.1% target. He said that it will likely be appropriate for the Fed to approve two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of this year. Currently, interest rates in the United States are at a twenty-year high of 5.25%-5.50%.\n\nThe interest rates were increased as a response to rising prices post-Covid. By doing this, the Fed controls the money supply in the economy, thereby gaining some control over inflation. However, the high interest rates are bad news for corporate America.\n\nMany fast-growing companies prefer to use debt to support their higher growth rather than equity. Debt is arguably less expensive for these companies as the rate of growth of business equity value is often greater than the borrowing cost of debt. However, as the interest rates get higher, the gap between the borrowing cost and the rate of growth of equity becomes narrower. Many fast-growing companies also prefer debt because loans do not provide an ownership stake. It also prevents the dilution of the owner's equity position in the business.\n\nFast-growing companies, however, are not the only businesses that use debt. Many businesses use debt for their leverage. Debt provides a way to consistently build equity value for the shareholders. In addition, interest payments on loans are treated as expenses and deducted from revenue, thereby resulting in lower taxes.\n\nDespite all the benefits of debt, the most indebted companies in the world are financial institutions. We saw a similar trend in our companies with the most cash reserves article, where an overwhelming majority were financial institutions. These institutions, particularly banks, rely on borrowing money as their business model. The bank's spread (the difference between the rate at which it borrows and lends) is an essential tool for its profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the high-interest rates, there is still significant borrowing in the US. There seems to be an endless demand for top-rated corporate debt in the country, which has created an unease among some investors. There is also a concern that liquidity conditions could worsen this year, as so far this year, investment-grade US companies have raised a record amount of debt.\n\nAccording to S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) corporate debt defaults increased by 80% in 2023. There is a strong likelihood that defaults will remain high this year too. As per S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) the number of companies that failed to make required payments on their debt totaled 153 for 2023, up from 85 in 2022. In 2024, S&P Global, Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) expects further debt deterioration globally, predominantly at the lower end of the ranking scale.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 25 most indebted companies in the world in 2024.  25 Most Indebted Companies in the World in 2024\n\nAn entrepreneur meeting with a financial advisor discussing venture debt opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the most indebted companies in the world in 2024, we looked at the latest debt figures on the balance sheet of companies. We used trusted sources for our research. Companies are ranked according to their debt, the higher their debt, the higher they rank on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "In this piece, we are going to shed light on the 20 Largest Banks in The World by Market Cap. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector, you can go directly to 5 Largest Banks in The World by Market Cap.\n\nThe global banking industry is on the rise, with a bright future ahead. Despite economic challenges like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the industry is set at $614.62 billion in 2023 and is expected to climb to a whopping $1,231.49 billion market size by 2027. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of digital banking, as more customers crave personalized and flexible services. Companies are also embracing cloud-native architecture to enhance their offerings. Oracle, for example, is leading the way with innovative cloud-native banking services. All in all, the industry is evolving to meet the changing needs of customers and is poised for continuous growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the global banking industry is in for some twists and turns. A slowdown in the global economy, along with a mix of economic uncertainties, will keep banks on their toes. While efforts to tackle inflation are showing progress in some places, other issues like supply chain disruptions, shifting trade dynamics, and geopolitical tensions are complicating matters. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects cautious global economic growth of around 3.0% in 2024, with advanced economies like the US, Euro area, Japan, UK, and Canada expected to see modest growth.\n\nOn the bright side, many emerging economies, fueled by strong consumer demand and favorable trade balances, are likely to outpace the pack. India, in particular, is poised for robust growth at 6.3%. However, China is facing some challenges with sluggish consumer demand and a shaky property market, which could have ripple effects globally. Efforts to boost confidence in China's economy could impact other Asian countries as well. Inflation is also a hot topic, with expectations of a decrease to 5.2% in 2024. Central banks will be busy adjusting their monetary policies to navigate these choppy waters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US Federal Reserve might tweak interest rates, while the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England, and Bank of Canada are also expected to make moves in response to changing economic conditions. Overall, central banks are gearing up to manage global money supply more closely as we head towards 2024.

        "title": "Wells Fargo slowly starts to shed the problems of its past",
        "content": "Wells Fargo's stock (WFC) is up 12% this year, outperforming all big bank rivals and within sight of an all-time high.\n\nOne big reason: Investors believe the San Francisco lending giant is slowly starting to shed some of the problems of its past.\n\nIt received a big boost last month when regulators with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency lifted a consent order tied to a 2016 fake accounts scandal.\n\nThe move was a victory for CEO Charles Scharf, who said when he took over the top job in 2019 that his \"first priority\" was to clean up the messes left by his predecessors. Charles Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo, testifies before a Senate committee last December. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nScharf is now looking to go on the offensive as he tries to make Wells Fargo into a major investment banking player, edging deeper into a hyper-competitive business where it lags behind Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nAnother push in that direction came this past week when Wells Fargo announced the hiring of M&A veteran Doug Braunstein, an executive Scharf knows from his days at JPMorgan when both Scharf and Braunstein were top lieutenants of Jamie Dimon in the tumultuous years following the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBraunstein knows what it's like to receive scrutiny from Washington. When he was CFO of JPMorgan during the \"London Whale\" trading debacle, he had to testify before Senate lawmakers in 2013. At Wells Fargo, Braunstein will report directly to the CEO as vice chairman.\n\n\"Doug is a world-class banker,\" Scharf said in a press release, noting that his \"expertise and business relationships reflect our continued commitment to strengthen\" Wells Fargo's Wall Street unit. Doug Braunstein, right, testified before a Senate committee in 2013 following sizable trading losses at JPMorgan, where he was CFO. REUTERS/Gary Cameron (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNot a 'light switch moment'\n\nThe CEO of the nation\u2019s fourth-largest bank is not out of the woods with regulators, however. Even though Scharf has ticked off six consent orders that regulators had in place when he became boss, Scharf still has eight to go \u2014 including two added during his tenure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big one is a cap on the size of Wells Fargo imposed by the Federal Reserve. It can\u2019t go past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 unless regulators say so. The Fed imposed the broad restriction in 2018, citing \"widespread consumer abuses\" at Wells Fargo.\n\nLifting that cap would allow Wells Fargo to boost activity in its capital-intensive markets business, CFO Mike Santomassimo said last Monday at a UBS conference in Florida.\n\n\"I would just caution that when it does happen, it\u2019s not this kind of light switch moment,\" Santomassimo said, but \"we do believe that there'll be some opportunity there.\" At the moment, \"our focus is really to solve the risk and regulatory work first. ... We can't lose sight of that.\"\n\nSeveral analysts who follow the bank said Wells Fargo is taking steps in the right direction, and they do expect the Fed to eventually take the bank out of the penalty box.\n\n\"They\u2019ve done a tremendous amount under these highly idiosyncratic restrictions,\" said Scott Siefers, an analyst for Piper Sandler who has covered the bank over nearly two decades. \"To reach the company's full potential, they will certainly need more freedom over some period of time,\" he added.\n\nThe timing for when the Fed removes Wells Fargo's balance sheet limit remains \"hard to predict,\" according to Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin.\n\nEven after this asset cap is removed, a second third-party review is required to assess the bank's improvements.\n\nCross-selling\n\nThe irony of Wells Fargo\u2019s regulatory predicament is that there was a time not that long ago when it faced fewer constraints than its peers.\n\nIt was able to dodge many of the problems that hobbled other big banks during the 2008 financial crisis and became a coast-to-coast giant with its purchase that year of Wachovia, a big Charlotte lender weakened by a national mortgage meltdown.\n\nThe bank emerged from the crisis with a reputation for being conservative, not taking a lot of risks, and relying on a plain-vanilla, old-fashioned strategy of boosting revenue by cross-selling various products to existing customers.\n\nBut that strength turned into a weakness after it became clear in the second half of last decade that the bank had opened millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge as employees raced to meet their sales goals.\n\nCEO John Stumpf, who had been with the bank for three decades, resigned and was later barred by regulators from the banking industry. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee in 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHis successor Tim Sloan left in 2019. He is now suing the bank in a California state court for $34 million, claiming the bank canceled stock grants and that Sloan was used as a \"scapegoat\" for the sales practices scandal.\n\nThe bank has said that it stands by its decisions and that \"compensation decisions are based on performance.\"\n\nThe search for a replacement landed Scharf, who had been in charge of JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank while working for Dimon and then became the CEO of credit card giant Visa (V) and custody bank Bank of New York Mellon (BK). Former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan testifies before a House committee in 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n'A different company today'\n\nHis own overhaul has not been without surprises, including a $3.7 billion pact in December 2022 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to resolve allegations that it illegally overcharged customers on their auto loans and mortgages. The actions at issue took place as recently as 2022.\n\nScharf has also significantly reduced the bank\u2019s workforce. Since peaking during the pandemic in 2020 with 276,000 employees, Wells has eliminated roughly 18% of its headcount \u2014 or 50,000 employees. The bank\u2019s CFO said this past week that Wells Fargo may also trim more real estate as a cost-cutting move.\n\nThere was also a new reminder this past week that the sales-practice scandal is still not totally behind the bank.\n\nThe company was sued in a San Francisco federal court by customers claiming the lender was not doing enough to assist those who were harmed by being signed up for products they didn't want.\n\nThe bank sent out letters asking for people to contact Wells Fargo if they had been enrolled in such products, but the lawsuit claims the letter burdens the customer to take action.\n\nWells Fargo tries \"to avoid, reduce, and delay its ultimate liability and sweep under the rug its long-standing, intentional misconduct,\" lawyers representing the bank's customers stated.\n\nThe bank said it is still reviewing the legal claims. \"Wells Fargo is a different company today, with new people, structure, processes, controls, and culture in place, and we have placed heavy emphasis on remediating customers for past practices,\" a spokeswoman for the bank added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "MNST, STZ, COCO: Cheers! 3 Analyst-Approved Beverage Stocks",
        "content": "The beverage scene has gotten much more interesting in recent years, with the \u201clittle guy\u201d looking to go against some of the industry\u2019s top heavyweight contenders. Undoubtedly, mega-cap beverage companies are some of the best recession-resilient stocks to sip on if you fear some sort of downturn. And while their economic moats (high barriers to entry) remain relatively wide, some smaller players on the scene, such as MNST, STZ, and COCO, have unique tricks up their sleeves to win over the consumer.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to weigh in on three beverage stocks that are favored by analysts.\n\nMonster Energy (NASDAQ:MNST)\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but Monster Energy stock has been one of the best market performers in recent decades, topping the likes of some pretty notable Magnificent Seven companies. Over the last 10 years, shares have risen 356%. And though the pace of gains has slowed somewhat, with shares rising just shy of 16% in the past year, I\u2019d argue the stock still makes sense to own for its robust brand and still-lengthy growth runway.\n\nWith a modest $61.5 billion market cap and caffeinated innovation flowing through its veins, I see a pathway to higher highs. As such, I\u2019m staying bullish on the stock as it looks to break out past its multi-quarter ceiling of resistance at $60 per share. Last year, Monster grew its drink revenue by 13%. It\u2019s not explosive growth, but it\u2019s decent for a drink company, nonetheless, especially when you factor in inflation.\n\nThe most enticing part of Monster\u2019s growth is that it may be more sustainable than mega-cap tech firms sporting similar growth rates. The company demonstrated its pricing power, hiking prices amid inflation to keep up with higher costs.\n\nThus far, consumers don\u2019t seem to be making a big deal of higher prices, as they would for some absurdly overpriced snack foods. People need their energy and want the drinks to taste good, which is a challenging feat, considering how some alternative options seem to taste downright unpleasant!\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a Zero-Sugar line (as well as other new products), the recent acquisition of Bang Energy, and plenty of international growth runway, I believe Monster has what it takes to continue delivering monster performance for investors. Just don\u2019t expect it to keep crushing the Magnificent Seven from here.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for MNST Stock?\n\nMonster stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average MNST stock price target of $64.10 implies 8.5% upside potential.\n\nConstellation Brands (NYSE:STZ)\n\nFrom caffeinated beverages to alcoholic ones, we have Constellation Brands, a firm that\u2019s really gone flat in recent years. The stock is just 4% higher than its peak in early 2021. And though the firm is technically a \u201csin stock,\u201d I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s one of the better value options to play the beverage scene right now, given its rock-solid brand portfolio and strength following its latest quarterly earnings.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) went as far as to name STZ as its top beverage stock pick. Clearly, the latest numbers gave them plenty of confidence. For now, I\u2019m sticking with the analyst community and am staying bullish.\n\nFive-star-rated Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohesenian views Constellation\u2019s growth profile as not yet being priced in quite yet. After a solid round of earnings and the means to triumph over its beer rivals, I\u2019d say the odds are on his side. Constellation certainly stock looks primed for performance.\n\nAt just 18.1 times next year\u2019s expected price-to-earnings (P/E), STZ looks like a relative bargain. Its Beer Business, in particular, is expected to see net sales growth of 7-9%.\n\nGiven that the firm owns some pretty premium brands in its portfolio, I\u2019m perplexed as to why shares trade at such a notable discount to the alcoholic beverages industry average of 20.9 times forward P/E. Perhaps Mr. Mohesenian is correct in that the market may be discounting the firm\u2019s growth prospects from here.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for STZ Stock?\n\nConstellation stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average STZ stock price target of $295.50 implies 18.9% upside potential.\n\nVita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO)\n\nShifting gears from beer to coconut water, we have Vita Coco, a mid-cap stock ($1.48 billion market cap) I think you have to own if you\u2019re a big fan of its products and the rise of healthy, plant-based beverages that don\u2019t skimp on the tastiness factor. As an all-natural product, coconut water stands out as one of the best positioned to ride the secular trend of increased health consciousness regarding food and drink.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s only one issue: coconut water is predominantly a commoditized product that can\u2019t really be differentiated by any sort of secret recipe. In any case, I view Vita Coco\u2019s well-run supply chain as an advantage that could help it rally even more. That said, I\u2019d keep tabs on industry competitors, especially those that are serious about cracking into the market. For now, I\u2019m staying bullish as the firm continues navigating through a tougher environment for consumers.\n\nCoconut water is way pricier than water, and that may make Vita Coco more sensitive to fluctuations in the economy. With inflation and macro headwinds weighing on all consumers, though, I find it remarkable that Vita Coco\u2019s numbers haven\u2019t been too negatively impacted.\n\nI attribute the company\u2019s resilience to its colossal growth runway, exceptional operational stewardship, and success with expanding into flavored forms of coconut water, something that could help Vita Coco differentiate itself from the competition, perhaps giving the firm the means to stand out in the otherwise commoditized coconut water market.\n\nAt 41.4 times trailing P/E (around 28 times forward), shares are priced with growth in mind. The real question is whether COCO can continue to find success as it expands into new geographies. If it can, the current price of admission seems fair or even a tad on the cheap side.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for COCO Stock?\n\nVita Coco stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average COCO stock price target of $29.20 implies 11.9% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nApart from the rise in health consciousness (saying no to sugar), it seems like younger generations are a bit more open to trying something new, especially if you\u2019ve got influencer marketing involved. Think Logan Paul and his Prime drinks, which have clearly hit a tune among young consumers. This alone may cause some to question if modern times pose a threat to some of the most old-fashioned moats out there.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think Warren Buffett needs to worry about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) anytime soon, I do believe that investors seeking a bit of sizzle should look beyond the classic beverage kingpin for greater growth. It also doesn\u2019t help that Coke shares have been flat lately, down 3% over the past two years.\n\nOf the fast-growing trio, analysts expect the most upside from STZ, with about 19% in gains expected for the year ahead.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley reportedly eyeing spot Bitcoin ETFs as demand shows no sign of slowing",
        "content": "Investment bank Morgan Stanley is reportedly looking into adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform.\n\nThe Wall Street behemoth is carrying out due diligence on the products, according to sources close to the matter, CoinDesk reported. If approved, Morgan Stanley would be the first among large registered investment advisor (RIA) networks and broker-dealer platforms to list the ETFs, potentially opening the floodgates for the likes of Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo to turbocharge inflows.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment when reached by Fortune.\n\nAs Bitcoin edges closer to its all-time high of $69,000 \u201copening the floodgates through more access points could support further buoyancy for Bitcoin,\u201d Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33, told Fortune.\n\nThe 10 currently traded U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs set a new record for daily trading volumes on Wednesday, with more than $7.6 billion in activity, according to Bloomberg data. The day before, BlackRock saw $520 million flood into its ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), marking the largest daily inflow so far.\n\n\"Word is wirehouse platforms are seriously looking at adding them soon. I'm sure pressure is mounting for them\" as ETF inflows continue to accelerate, Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas tweeted on Wednesday, referring to large broker-dealers. \"With grassroots demand like this they gonna have to expedite.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cImagine being [a] Morgan adviser and your client wants IBIT and you have to be like \u2018I don\u2019t have access to it, my mommy (the platform gatekeeper) won\u2019t allow it.\u2019 That\u2019s gotta be embarrassing.\"\n\nRIDIC: the New Nine doubled their volume record (set Monday) with just about $6b traded.. $IBIT led w $3.3b of it, Fidelity did $1.4b (both double their prev records). The total number of trades was double too, over half a million individual trades bt them. $IBIT alone > $QQQ. pic.twitter.com/ZzB5PWXA4f\n\n\u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 28, 2024\n\n\u201cThese networks and platforms are the addressable market for Bitcoin that the ETFs were always supposed to open up. We know of other big wirehouses or advisor platforms that have approved some of these ETFs for trading already,\u201d Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart told Fortune. \u201cI think eventually the vast majority of platforms, if not all, will approve these things.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it may take the larger platforms a bit longer to establish these vehicles because of longer due diligence processes, Seyffart added.\n\nWith over $150 billion in assets under management, Morgan Stanley first offered clients access to Bitcoin via a pair of external crypto funds in 2021, and was the first major bank to do so. The funds were offered by Galaxy Digital and NYDIG for qualified investors.\n\nIf platforms like Morgan Stanley list the ETFs, the educational element will be the most significant long-term consequence for Bitcoin's trajectory, Andy Baehr, head of product at CoinDesk Indices, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cAdvisors can talk about Bitcoin during their day jobs,\" Baehr said, \"and really think about how it can help contribute to portfolios on such massive scales like this.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nKnight-Swift Transportation announced Tuesday that President and CEO Dave Jackson has stepped down. He will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Adam Miller.\n\nThe change follows multiple quarters of depressed results, largely due to a prolonged freight recession, but also as the company\u2019s third-party insurance venture has been operating at a loss. The business, which brokers liability coverage to small carriers, has suffered from unfavorable claims developments and has struggled to collect premiums from carriers during the downturn.\n\nThe company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that it initiated a process to exit the business. The unit booked a $71.7 million operating loss during the period. Knight-Swift\u2019s adjusted earnings per share fell to $1.72 in 2023 versus a record of $5.03 during the 2022 peak.\n\nJackson has also left also left Knight-Swift\u2019s (NYSE: KNX) board of directors.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for Dave\u2019s service as CEO over the past nine years, a period that has been transformational for the Company and rewarding for our stockholders,\u201d said Kevin Knight, Knight-Swift\u2019s executive chairman. \u201cDave will always be part of the Knight-Swift family, and we wish him all the best.\u201d\n\nMiller joined Knight-Swift (NYSE: KNX) in 2002 and has held various roles with increasing responsibilities since. In addition to holding the top finance position, Miller was president at Swift Transportation and was the combined company\u2019s secretary and treasurer.\n\n\u201cAdam\u2019s broad strategic, financial, and operating experience during his 22-year career at Knight-Swift has him well-prepared and ready to lead as CEO,\u201d stated Knight in a news release. \u201cDuring his tenure, he played leading roles in establishing Knight Refrigerated as a major player in its market, integrating Swift after the merger and improving its operations, service and profitability, while overseeing our capital structure and financial performance as Chief Financial Officer.\u201d\n\nMiller said he \u201cwill be intently focused on expanding our LTL footprint, improving consolidated margins, and generating free cash flow and stockholder returns.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAndrew Hess will take over the role of CFO. He was previously the senior vice president of M&A where he was integral in the acquisitions of two less-than-truckload carriers and U.S. Xpress.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) analyst Ravi Shanker said the \u201cnews will likely come as a significant surprise to the Street,\u201d noting the company\u2019s \u201crecent earnings trajectory has no doubt been disappointing,\u201d during what he described as a prolonged downturn.\n\nBut Shanker said in a Tuesday note to clients that Jackson \u201cdeserves credit\u201d for the company\u2019s diversification into LTL, the U.S. Xpress acquisition and growth in the company\u2019s logistics and intermodal offerings.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe this change was precipitated by the discovery of bad news at USX or any other factor that would derail KNX\u2019s current earnings trajectory,\u201d Shanker said. \u201cWe believe the sudden and extreme step of a CEO change could be viewed by the Street as the Board showing urgency to put KNX back on a path to normalized EPS, which will be viewed as a positive.\u201d\n\nJackson has been CEO for the past nine years and president for the past 13 years.\n\n\u201cAfter nearly 24 years at Knight-Swift, it is time for a change and for the next generation to take the baton,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAdam and Andrew are ready, the timing is right, the company is well positioned, and they have my full support. I look forward to my next chapter and to continuing to make a difference in the community.\u201d\n\nShares of KNX were down 1.9% Tuesday at 11:52 a.m. EST compared to the S&P 500, which was flat.\n\nMore FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden\n\nJ.B.

        "content": "Mergers and acquisitions are seeing a resurgence so far in 2024, but some of the top bankers on Wall Street are being careful not to overhype the dealmaking revival.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said Tuesday at a UBS financial services conference that \"it's gotten better\" compared with \"super anemic\" activity during parts of 2022 and 2023.\n\nHowever, Solomon does not expect investment banking to climb back to historical averages over the last decade. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum also poured some cold water on dealmaking expectations, acknowledging \"some momentum\" while also citing headwinds from lingering geopolitical uncertainty and aggressive antitrust scrutiny from Washington.\n\n\"Not the most conducive\" M&A environment, he said at the same UBS financial services conference in Key Biscayne, Fla.\n\nBig banks have been waiting two years for M&A to pick back up again. Last year was supposed to be the year things turned around; instead, 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nA lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates at some point this year, and that could hurt the giant banks that were able to charge a lot more for their loans when rates were higher.\n\nDeals are picking up significantly compared to this time last year, according to data provider Dealogic. The volume of US mergers is up 134% so far this quarter as of Tuesday morning compared to the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat surge includes a string of major deals announced in the US, including three last week amounting to $53 billion. The headliner was credit card lender Capital One (COF) saying it would acquire rival Discover Financial Services (DFS) for roughly $35 billion. Capital One headquarters in McLean, Va. (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nThese pacts could mean hundreds of millions in new fees for some of the biggest banks. Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), and Citigroup (C) all had a hand in at least one of the transactions.\n\nNo firm stands to benefit more from a revival more than Goldman. Profits were down 24% in 2023 due to the dealmaking slowdown and costs associated with the company's high-profile exit from consumer lending.\n\nIts full-year net income of $8.52 billion was the worst mark for Goldman since 2019, Solomon's first full year in charge. The firm did, however, post a sizable gain in the fourth quarter as equities trading and wealth management rose.\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman\u2019s board of directors awarded Solomon a 24% pay increase despite the challenging year. Solomon took home $31 million.\n\n\"I think we're gonna see a better operating environment for our core business. That doesn't mean every quarter, every minute, but I I think we've seen it already,\" said Solomon.\n\n\"I feel great about the way that the firm\u2019s positioned. I feel great about our client franchise and I think we're going to continue to deliver good returns for shareholders,\" he added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 25 most popular dog breeds in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion regarding the pet industry and pet ownership in the US, visit the 7 most popular dog breeds in 2024.\n\nPet ownership in the United States surged unprecedently after the onset of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. A Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) report in 2022 revealed that 5 million more pets have found their way to American households since the onset of COVID-19.\n\nTo put things into perspective, American pet ownership's growth rate almost doubled between 2020 and 2022. Pet ownership in the US from 2009 to 2019 grew by 4.7%. However, during the years 2020 and 2022, it grew by more than 9%. One interesting thing to note is that between 2021 and 2022, nearly 1 in 10 people between the ages of 50 and 80 got a new pet. So, there is a considerable increase in pet ownership among senior people. It is also worth noting that according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) the pet services industry is set to grow at an 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) till 2030. In addition, the annual per-pet spending is expected to reach $1,320 by 2025 and $,1897 by 2030. In the year 2022, Americans spent a whopping $136.8 billion on pet care, as well.\n\nPet ownership is already quite popular in the United States. A 2023 survey shows that 66% of the households in the country own a pet. As expected, the most popular pets in the United States are dogs. Nearly 65.1 million out of the 86.9 million pet-owning households own a dog.\n\nThe pet care industry is huge all around the world. The Global pet care market was valued at $159.1 billion in 2022. It is set to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% between the forecast period of 2022 to 2030. The market is expected to reach $236.16 billion towards the end of this period.\n\nWhile the United States remains the largest market for pet care globally, some emerging economies, particularly from the Asia Pacific region have strong growth prospects. Some of the factors driving the growth of the pet care market include an increasing consciousness of pet health and the integration of technology in health care. Recently, there has been a surge of online subscription-based pet clinics offering 24/7 consultations.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the surge in pet ownership and a rising interest in pet care, it is worth having a look at some of the largest players in the market. These include Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) and Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:WOOF).\n\nChewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) is a Plantation, Florida-based company that manufactures and sells a variety of pet care products. These products include pet treats and medications. Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) announced the launch of Chewy Vet Care on 14th December 2023.

The company announced the launch of customizable pet health insurance on petco.com in January. This health insurance platform by Petco Health and Wellness Company, Inc.

To curate our list, we used five sources (1,2,3,4,5). Each time a breed was mentioned by our sources, we noted it along with its ranking on our sources.\n\nIn our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the breed appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of breeds in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 25/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey Popularity score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor.\n\nThe ranking factor is designed in a way that it is always positive but less than 1. So, if the Insider Monkey Popularity score of breed A is 3.75, 3 is its frequency, whereas 0.75 is its ranking factor. For comparison, if breed B had an Insider Monkey Popularity Score of 4.40, its frequency is 4, but overall it ranked lower than breed A on our sources. However, since we give more priority to frequency, breed B ranks higher on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best environmental dividend stocks to invest in according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of ESG investing and its prospects, and go directly to read 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Invest In According To Analysts.\n\nSustainable investing, increasingly gaining traction among investors, represents a pivotal shift in financial markets towards aligning profit motives with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. A growing number of individuals are becoming attracted to ESG investments for a variety of reasons, ranging from ethical concerns to sound financial decision-making. As per research conducted by deVere Group, over 800 clients revealed that more than half (56%) of investors expressed their intentions to boost their investments in ESG funds in 2024.\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the year 2023 did not fare well for such investment strategies. Investors persisted in withdrawing their investments from sustainable funds during the fourth quarter of 2023. U.S. sustainable funds experienced their initial year of outflows since records began over a decade ago, marking 2023 as their most challenging year to date, according to a report by Morningstar. In the fourth quarter alone, investors withdrew $5 billion from U.S. sustainable funds, contributing to a total outflow of $13 billion throughout the year. This trend was attributed to underperformance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and a challenging year for an iShares fund. Moreover, by the end of 2023, the total assets invested in sustainable funds reached $323 billion. This figure indicates a drop of approximately 12% from the previous record high recorded at the end of 2021. However, it also signifies an 18% increase from the lowest point observed in the third quarter of 2022. In contrast, assets within the broader U.S. funds market reached their peak at the end of 2021 but experienced a decline of 5% by the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, analysts are optimistic about the potential of ESG investing in the foreseeable future. Based on a study conducted by Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are projected to surpass $53 trillion by 2025, constituting more than a third of the estimated total assets under management of $140.5 trillion. The convergence of factors including the pandemic and the green recovery initiatives in major economies such as the U.S., EU, and China is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of ESG in evaluating a fresh array of financial risks and leveraging capital markets.\n\nAs discussed previously, there is a growing trend among investors towards ESG investing, primarily due to the reputation of these assets for delivering consistent returns. Contrary to concerns regarding potential conflicts between financial gains and ESG principles, a survey conducted by PwC revealed that nine out of ten asset managers believe that incorporating ESG criteria into their investment approach will enhance overall returns. Moreover, a majority of institutional investors, accounting for 60%, reported experiencing higher performance yields from ESG investments compared to non-ESG alternatives. The survey also noted that investors are willing to pay for ESG performance, as they anticipate the potential for higher returns. Specifically, three-quarters of those surveyed, constituting 78%, expressed their readiness to pay elevated fees for ESG funds.\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) are some of the best companies in the realm of ESG investing.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Morgan Stanley (MS): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has gained 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.36 points to a change of +16.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of +14.2% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.1%. The $56.83 billion and $59.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +4.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +7.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "13 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For Long-Term",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best bank stocks to invest in for long term. If you want to skip our coverage of the banking industry and how it started to trouble investors once again this year, you can take a look at 5 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For Long-Term.\n\nDue to the current macroeconomic environment, the banking industry in the U.S. and globally has been one of the most important and most watched sectors. This is because right now, apart from artificial intelligence and AI stocks, the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy is a must watch item on the agenda of both retail and professional investors. Investors are wondering when the rates will start to drop. These rate cuts will be quite important for the banking industry as well as for broader sectors such as commercial and office real estate that have struggled in the aftermath of turmoil in the bond market. 2023 was a notable year for bank stocks and it saw a widespread bloodbath in the regional banking sector. Multiple big regional banks failed as they were unable to assess the impact of rising bond yields on their asset bases.\n\nThis turmoil resurfaced in 2024 as well. While investors were cheering AI stocks and pumping up the shares of NVIDIA Corporation, the shares of New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) crashed by 59% in late January and early February after the New York state based regional bank warned in its earnings report that it had to allocate additional capital for trouble in the office real estate sector. Additionally, just as the turmoil in 2023 had prompted the Federal Reserve to step up its efforts at ensuring that the U.S. banking sector was healthy by running stress tests, the NYCB scare of 2024 in the wake of its surprising loss and capital allocation has now spurred the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and other banking bodies to inquire from banks whether they are adequately prepared for any untoward events according to media reports. Due to the sizeable role that they play in funding commercial real estate, small banks are quite exposed to jitters in the market, and anyone interested in following bank stocks would also be well advised to watch the commercial real estate sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut what about mega bank stocks? After all, following the 2023 regional banking crisis, large banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) had remained unscathed despite some fears about their instability. Well, the start of 2024 has seen the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fine Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) a sizeable $1.3 million over the bank's failure to properly deal with municipal securities. Additionally, if we're to slightly expand our focus from pure play banking to the broader financial services sector, then 2024 has also seen one of the biggest deals in the banking industry.\n\nOnline banking stock Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) announced a whopping $35 billion deal for Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and as investors remain unconvinced that the affair could clear regulatory scrutiny, analysts believe that if Capital One shows that it will help consumers save money and benefit them in other ways, then it might be able to take on giants such as Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).\n\nSo, as the banking sector continues to be as dynamic as ever and investors hope for rate cuts soon, we decided to look at some top banking stocks for the long term. A handful of the top names are Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and you can also check out 12 Best-Performing Bank Stocks In 2024. 13 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For Long-Term\n\nA person using a mobile device to access their bank account information.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best bank stocks for the long term, we ranked the forty most valuable diversified and regional banking stocks that trade on U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end. Out of these, the bank stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were chosen.\n\nFor these best bank stocks for the long term, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on the latest SEC 10-K filing. Deep dive into Morgan Stanley's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Data-driven insights to inform investment decisions and understand Morgan Stanley's strategic direction. Expert analysis of financial performance and market trends impacting Morgan Stanley.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MS.\n\nOn February 22, 2024, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), a leading global investment bank with a rich history dating back to 1924, filed its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing provides a detailed look at the company's financial health and strategic positioning. With over $4 trillion in client assets and a workforce exceeding 80,000 employees, Morgan Stanley operates through three primary segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management. The company's revenue is well-diversified, with approximately 50% stemming from institutional securities and the remainder from wealth and investment management. Notably, 30% of total revenue is generated outside the Americas, indicating a strong international presence. A review of the financial tables within the filing reveals a robust balance sheet, with significant market positions in each of its business segments, highlighting Morgan Stanley's financial resilience and adaptability in the dynamic financial services landscape. Decoding Morgan Stanley (MS): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Position and Diversified Revenue Streams: Morgan Stanley's prominent market position is a testament to its enduring brand and diversified revenue streams. The company's institutional securities business, accounting for half of its net revenue, is complemented by its wealth and investment management segments. This diversification not only mitigates risk but also allows for consistent revenue generation across various market conditions. The strength of its market position is further evidenced by its expansive global footprint, with a significant portion of revenue derived from international operations, showcasing its ability to attract and serve a global client base.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobust Financial Performance: The company's financial health is a cornerstone of its strength. Morgan Stanley's balance sheet, as reflected in the 10-K filing, demonstrates solid financial performance with substantial assets under management. The firm's ability to generate revenue and control costs effectively has resulted in a strong capital position, enabling strategic investments and shareholder returns. This financial stability is crucial in weathering economic fluctuations and investing in growth opportunities.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks: As a global financial institution, Morgan Stanley is subject to a complex regulatory environment that can impact its operations and profitability. The filing underscores the challenges posed by stringent capital and liquidity requirements, which can constrain the company's ability to engage in certain transactions and increase operational costs. These regulatory pressures necessitate continuous investment in compliance and risk management systems, potentially diverting resources from other strategic initiatives.\n\nCompetitive Pressures and Technological Disruption: The financial services industry is highly competitive, with traditional and non-traditional players vying for market share. Morgan Stanley faces intense competition from banks, investment firms, fintech companies, and other financial service providers. The rise of digital asset capabilities and automated trading platforms has intensified this competition, putting pressure on the company to innovate and adapt continuously. Failure to keep pace with technological advancements and evolving customer preferences could erode Morgan Stanley's competitive edge.\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechnological Innovation and Digital Transformation: The rapid evolution of financial technology presents Morgan Stanley with opportunities to enhance its service offerings and operational efficiency. Investing in digital platforms, such as online trading and banking services, can attract a new generation of clients and improve the customer experience. Embracing technological innovation can also lead to cost savings and more effective risk management, positioning the company to capitalize on the digital transformation of the financial industry.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions and Alliances: Morgan Stanley's strong capital position enables it to pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances that can expand its market presence and product offerings. By acquiring or partnering with fintech firms and other innovative companies, Morgan Stanley can access new technologies, enter emerging markets, and diversify its revenue streams. These strategic moves can bolster the company's competitive position and drive long-term growth.\n\nThreats\n\nGlobal Economic and Political Uncertainties: The company operates in a global landscape fraught with economic and political uncertainties, including trade policies, geopolitical events, and changes in tax laws. Such external factors can adversely affect investor sentiment, market stability, and the company's international operations. Morgan Stanley must navigate these challenges carefully to maintain its financial performance and client confidence.\n\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Concerns: In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns pose significant risks to financial institutions like Morgan Stanley. A data breach or cyber-attack can lead to substantial financial losses, reputational damage, and erosion of client trust. The company must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures and data protection protocols to safeguard its operations and sensitive client information.\n\nIn conclusion, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) exhibits a strong market position with diversified revenue streams and robust financial performance, which are central to its competitive advantage. However, it must contend with regulatory complexities, competitive pressures, and technological disruption. Opportunities for growth lie in technological innovation and strategic acquisitions, while global economic uncertainties and cybersecurity threats present ongoing challenges. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Morgan Stanley can capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate potential threats, ensuring its continued success in the dynamic financial services sector.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Mike Ashley is suing Morgan Stanley for \u20ac47m - Jamie Lorriman\n\nOne of Morgan Stanley\u2019s most senior dealmakers branded Mike Ashley \u201cdishonest\u201d after the Wall Street bank threatened to cancel his \u20ac220m bets on Hugo Boss.\n\nSimon Smith, joint global head of investment banking, allegedly warned that the retail billionaire is \u201cnot a client with whom we wanted to do business\u201d after Morgan Stanley demanded $1bn from Mr Ashley\u2019s retail empire Frasers Group.\n\nAccording to written evidence shared with the High Court, Mr Smith allegedly shared these objections with the banker behind the cash call, Christopher Good.\n\nMr Ashley is suing Morgan Stanley for \u20ac47m over its attempts to force Frasers to abandon its stock market bets on German fashion brand Hugo Boss in May 2021.\n\nThe US investment bank threatened to close out the trades using a process called a margin call, which ultimately required Frasers to provide extra funds to cover a potential 400pc move in Hugo Boss\u2019s share price.\n\nMorgan Stanley did not deal directly with the Sports Direct founder but instead passed the margin call to Saxo Bank, an intermediary. Frasers was ultimately forced to transfer the trades to rival bank HSBC.\n\nMr Good, head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s risk management team, said in written evidence that he triggered the $915m margin call after being \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the large single stock position.\n\nWhen later exploring whether Frasers could post Hugo Boss stock as collateral, the senior risk manager said he called Mr Smith as a last resort to \u201cget some colour\u201d on why he previously decided against doing business with Mr Ashley.\n\nMr Good said: \u201cSimon told me that he had concerns about Mike Ashley, one of which was that he is known for being litigious, and took the view that he was not a client with whom we wanted to do business.\u201d\n\nMr Good told the High Court on Friday that Mr Smith also described the entrepreneur as \u201cuntrustworthy or dishonest\u201d.\n\nThe conversation came months after Mr Smith allegedly rejected an attempt by Mr Ashley to open a prime brokerage account over \u201canimus\u201d towards him.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe brokerage account would have provided Frasers access to the full range of financial tools used by institutions and hedge funds to play the markets.\n\nIn his written testimony, Mr Good said he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cbacked into a position\u201d of dealing with Frasers directly, considering Morgan Stanley had already rejected them.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe fact that Frasers was back-dooring us \u2013 doing business with us via Saxo that Morgan Stanley had rejected \u2013 was a separate aggravation: I still had a risk [the Hugo Boss trades] which I needed to be removed.\u201d\n\nMr Good claims he \u201cknew nothing about\u201d either Frasers or Mr Ashley when making the margin call.\n\nHe denies there was any \u201cconspiracy\u201d behind the margin call, nor \u201cany intention to harm Frasers\u201d.\n\nMorgan Stanley rejects the claim as contrived and without merit.\n\nThe case continues.",

Mega-cap tech leads while small caps and the cyclical and defensive niches of the global equity market lag. The broadening-out theme from late 2023 has petered out, leaving the bears quick to suggest that fewer bullish stocks might not be a good thing as we progress through a historically dicey calendar stretch from mid-February through mid-March.\n\nToo much of a good thing?\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with SFM.\n\nStill, earnings have come in well, and a second consecutive quarter of year-on-year EPS growth appears likely, according to the latest numbers from Factset.[1] Thus, it's not surprising that the S&P 500 rallied to all-time highs earlier this month before that hot CPI print for January spooked Wall Street.\n\nThe bulls still have in their back pockets robust economic data trends - the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index has taken off since the start of the year.[2] Normally that would be a boon to small-sized domestic companies and stocks in economically sensitive sectors, but robust data continues to push out the first expected Fed rate cut, viewed bearishly by investors. All eyes will be on upcoming PCE data while ears will be tuned to Fed Speak before the March 20 FOMC gathering.\n\n2024's emerging risks and opportunities\n\nBig picture, interest rates have been back on the rise while oil prices have quietly rallied toward fresh three-month highs, perhaps putting pressure on cyclical companies. Meanwhile, AI's awe feels stronger than ever after a lull in the second half of 2023 as a few cracks in the consumer appear.\n\nBut with ebbing corporate bankruptcies, rising dividends, tight credit spreads, and high demand for corporate bond issuance, there appear to be some tailwinds in play heading into springtime.[3]\n\nConferences in the Spotlight\n\nWhile these macroeconomic trends are important, sector and industry-level details are often discovered at corporate conferences.

The report, which defines the ultra-wealthy as individuals possessing $30 million or more in assets, unveils a surprising statistic\u201467.7% of the world's ultra-wealthy are self-made. This revelation not only debunks the myth that significant wealth is predominantly a product of inheritance but also underscores the potential for individuals to amass fortunes from humble beginnings.\n\nWhat adds another layer of fascination to this narrative is the rapid ascent of the self-made ultra-wealthy. Between the 2019 and 2020 reports, the number of ultra-wealthy individuals surged from 265,490 to 290,720, marking an astonishing nearly 10% increase. This surge indicates a dynamic shift in the landscape of wealth creation, suggesting that achieving the seemingly \"impossible\" is not only possible but is becoming more commonplace. As we delve into the intricacies of building wealth without relying on real estate, these statistics serve as a compelling backdrop, emphasizing the evolving opportunities for individuals to forge their paths to financial success.\n\nIt is intriguing to note the varying perspectives on wealth among different generations. While only 41% of Americans believe they will ever achieve wealth, there is a notable divergence between age groups. Younger individuals, with nearly 70% of Gen Z and 54% of millennials expressing optimism about future wealth accumulation, demonstrate a more hopeful outlook. Furthermore, the younger generations exhibit a greater faith in the stock market, with 38% of Gen Z and 37% of millennials viewing it as the best route to wealth, compared to 30% of Gen X and 24% of baby boomers.\n\nWhile real estate has maintained its status as a traditional route to prosperity, this article contends that it is by no means the only viable option. By exploring alternative methods, readers will discover that building wealth and breaking free from the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle can be achieved without necessarily investing in property. The importance of dispelling the notion that saving alone leads to wealth cannot be overstated. With inflation rates exceeding 8%, keeping money dormant in a bank account results in a significant loss of value over time. The argument here is not against savings, but rather an encouragement to embrace a more dynamic and growth-oriented financial strategy. 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate\n\nAn executive in a luxury office, speaking on a conference call about wealth management investments.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo come up with our list of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate, we conducted an extensive research, relying on experts\u2019 opinion, running around on various sources, to finalize our list. The sources used are namely, Sarwa, CNBC, Forbes, Finance Buzz, and Business Insider. With his, let us now look now head on to our list of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Switch Jobs\n\nStrategic job changes can be a powerful wealth-building move. In 2022, over 22% of workers aged 20+ changed jobs in under a year. Job hoppers beat inflation in 49% of cases, compared to 42% who stayed put. As skills and experience grow, so does market value, allowing for higher salary negotiations. Beyond immediate pay bumps, job hopping fosters long-term wealth by enabling skill development and expanding professional networks. Overall, it's a way to maximize earning potential and secure financial growth.\n\n14. Invest in your Education\n\nInvesting in education is a powerful wealth-building strategy. By focusing on personal development and continuous learning, individuals can unlock better job opportunities, promotions, and high-income careers. This doesn't always require a large financial investment; resources like reading, online courses, and mentorship offer cost-effective paths to growth. Moreover, education fosters resilience, innovation, and financial literacy, empowering individuals to navigate economic challenges and optimize wealth accumulation over time.\n\n13. Do not carry Credit Card Debt\n\nAvoiding credit card debt is crucial for wealth-building. Paying off your balances in full each month prevents high-interest charges, saving money and preserving a healthy credit score. This ensures access to better financial products and interest rates when necessary.\n\n12. Have enough Insurance\n\nInsurance is a vital component of any budget, safeguarding you from substantial financial losses in unfortunate events. Health insurance is essential to avoid crippling expenses from medical issues. Homeowner and auto insurance protect your property and vehicles. Additionally, term life insurance provides financial security for dependents. While building wealth is important, protecting it from unforeseen circumstances is equally crucial. Proactively insuring your most valuable assets ensures financial stability. As Jack Ma, a renowned Chinese business investor, wisely stated, \"Buying insurance cannot change your life but it prevents your life from being changed.\"\n\n11. Tackle your Debt\n\nMaterial wealth doesn't guarantee a positive net worth; having $1 million in the stock market doesn't offset $1 million in debt, resulting in a net worth of zero. Accumulating substantial debt is a major obstacle to financial prosperity. Paying off debt not only builds wealth but also reduces stress and enhances peace of mind. While some debt can be beneficial if used wisely, minimizing debt and financial burdens is advisable. Ultimately, carrying as little debt as possible is key to financial stability and wealth accumulation, according to most financial advisors.\n\n10. Peer-to-Peer Lending\n\nPeer-to-peer lending, or P2P lending, facilitates borrowing money from individuals or businesses via online platforms that connect borrowers with lenders. Lenders earn money through interest charged on the loans they provide. Interest rates on P2P loans vary based on borrower risk, loan term, and other factors, typically exceeding rates offered by traditional savings accounts or investments. P2P lending platforms offer annual returns ranging from 4% to 15%, contingent on the platform and specific loan.\n\n9. Put Your Money in 401(k)s and IRAs\n\nAn Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a personal retirement account, whereas a 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. With a 401(k), a portion of your paycheck is automatically deposited into the account, often with an employer match. Conversely, with an IRA, contributions are made by the individual, with no employer involvement. Personal finance expert, Jean Chatzky, highlighted that the automated nature of 401(k)s, simplifies contributions compared to IRA contributions, which require active decisions. Once contributions begin, the focus should be on long-term growth through strategic investments.\n\n8. Open a Taxable Investment Account\n\nOnce you've maximized contributions to your IRA and 401(k) accounts, the next step is to open a taxable investment account, also known as a brokerage account. Allocate a predetermined amount to this account annually. Experts from Business Insider recommend allocating 25% of your gross income each year to a combination of retirement and brokerage accounts for wealth management clients. This diversified approach ensures that you continue building wealth beyond retirement savings, while maximizing investment opportunities and potential returns.\n\n7. Explore Passive Income Ideas\n\nDiversifying your income beyond your main job or business is crucial for building wealth from scratch. Passive income, which doesn't require constant labor, offers financial freedom beyond typical employment. Warren Buffett's famous advice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,\u201d underscores the importance of earning even when you're not actively working. In today's digital economy, there are various avenues for passive income, such as affiliate marketing, drop shipping, and selling digital products.\n\n6. Invest in Commodities\n\nCommodity trading predates stocks and bonds and now takes place on specialized stock marketplaces known as commodity exchanges. Today, millions of individuals invest in commodities daily. One of the primary benefits of commodity investments is their ability to hedge against inflation. During periods of high inflation, prices of most goods tend to rise, making commodities an attractive investment option.\n\nCommodities, like gold or oil, offer diversification and can act as hedges against inflation. These investments are highly liquid, making it easier to buy and sell. Despite their sensitivity to factors like currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market changes, there is a robust global demand for investing in commodity futures due to their potential for profit.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about 5 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Right Now 10 Best Performing Bond ETFs in 2023 10 Cheap REITs with Huge Upside\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

The deposit demand hit him like a \u201cnuclear bomb,\u201d leaving him in disbelief and frustration, he told the court during two days of testimony. The bank acted in part on account of \u201csnobbery,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was \u201chorrific, just unthinkable, impossible,\u201d Ashley said referring to the margin call. Ashley\u2019s firm has sought about $50 million in damages.\n\nMorgan Stanley has sought to counter the lawsuitn calling Frasers\u2019 claim divorced from reality. The retailer didn\u2019t suffer any loss when it transferred the trades away from Morgan Stanley, the US bank\u2019s lawyers said. \u201cFrasers has embarked on lawfare against Morgan Stanley on an extraordinary scale,\u201d the lawyers said.\n\nAshley denied he derived pleasure from litigating and said the case was not personal. Before the dispute arose in May 2021, Morgan Stanley was unwilling to offer corporate and advisory services to Frasers because of Ashley\u2019s reputation, \u201cdeserved or otherwise,\u201d for being litigious among other reasons, the bank\u2019s lawyers have said.\n\n\u201cI can assure you there is no pleasure in litigation,\u201d Ashley said responding to a question. \u201cIf you end up in a position that you own one of the country\u2019s biggest football clubs it comes with the territory,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAshley and his firm have been involved in court cases ranging from defamation against a national newspaper to drunken promises over a bonus worth millions made in a London pub. He also fought his former friend over a Dubai bar-room incident and funded a court challenge to unravel a deal to save a department store chains operator.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an over-litigious person,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything I would try to avoid it. It\u2019s not a pleasant experience.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the testimony. \u201cFrasers has never been a client of Morgan Stanley.

I can\u2019t have done more than I did \u2013 that\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nMr Ashley\u2019s stock bets on German retailer Hugo Boss were at risk of being closed out by Morgan Stanley using a process known as a margin call, where parties are asked to deposit extra cash to backstop their investment positions.\n\nThe Wall Street bank did not deal directly with Mr Ashley but instead passed the margin call to Saxo Bank, an intermediary, after learning that he was ultimately behind the trades.\n\nFrasers is now suing Morgan Stanley for about \u20ac47m (\u00a340m) over allegedly lost trading profits and the costs of transferring the trades to rival lender HSBC.\n\nIn court filings quoting bank staff, Frasers said Mr Ashley was viewed as an \u201cupstart\u201d, who would have \u201czero respect to the norms of the way in which we do business\u201d.\n\nWhen asked by Morgan Stanley\u2019s lawyer whether he actually believed these allegations, Mr Ashley on Thursday said: \u201cI do believe that there\u2019s an element of truth in that.\u201d\n\nMr Ashley, who has a net worth of about \u00a35bn, said that Morgan Stanley threatened to close the positions even after he offered to post Hugo Boss stock and \u00a3100m in cash as collateral.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m a victim of Morgan Stanley\u2019s abuse.\u201d\n\nThe tycoon argued that if Frasers had borrowed money from HSBC to meet the margin call then Morgan Stanley would have come back with further demands for collateral and added \u201canother nought on\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe told the High Court: \u201cI\u2019ve offered them the world and that\u2019s not enough \u2013 this is really starting to annoy me.\u201d\n\nThe retailer has so far spent between \u00a33m and \u00a35m on its legal battle against Morgan Stanley, which Mr Ashley said is \u201cnot a sizeable sum of money in relation to Frasers\u201d.\n\nHe argued the main object of the lawsuit is to show how \u201cgrotesquely and unfairly Morgan Stanley acted\u201d.\n\nThese costs include Frasers\u2019 applications to US courts to compel James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley chief executive, to testify and produce evidence in its UK lawsuit.\n\nMorgan Stanley rejects the claim as contrived and without merit, arguing that the margin call was to protect it against a potential 400pc rise in Hugo Boss shares.\n\nMr Ashley said that Frasers is also covering the separate costs of his own data protection lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, filed in the High Court earlier this month.\n\nThe case continues.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will be presenting 12 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child. If you want to skip detailed analysis of Estate Planning sector, you can go directly to 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.\n\nEstate planning has been a practice since ancient times, with examples dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. Then, documents were used to ensure proper inheritance, typically favouring male heirs. The process involved witnesses, signatures, and the creator being of sound mind. Throughout history, various societies have had their own versions of inheritance laws, including references in ancient religious texts.\n\nHowever, in more recent history, the right to estate planning was reserved for a privileged elite, denying access to minority groups like Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Even after legal changes, many communities still lack easy access to education about estate planning. It is essential for underserved populations to have equal opportunities for creating estate plans to protect themselves and their families. Contrary to common belief, estate planning is not just for the wealthy and well-defined group of society but is important for everyone.\n\nAs of 2024, only 32% of Americans has a will, marking a 6% decline compared to 2023, the first drop in estate planning rates since 2020. The survey by Caring.com revealed that 40% of individuals without a will cited insufficient assets as the reason. Notably, lower-income Americans were twice as likely to mention this, reflecting the disproportionate impact of the economic situation on their decision-making regarding estate planning.\n\nIncome inequality has played a significant role in estate planning trends, with lower-income households experiencing more vulnerability to inflation and economic challenges. The decrease in estate planning rates is evident across different demographic groups, but young adults aged 18-34 are the only age group that has not experienced a decline since 2020. It is crucial to emphasize that estate planning is essential for everyone, not just the wealthy. Despite 64% of Americans acknowledging the importance of having a will, only 32% have one. This underscores the need for increased awareness and access to estate planning resources for all individuals, regardless of their financial circumstances.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trusts and Estates sector deals with managing trusts, estates, and agency accounts according to fiduciary agreements for beneficiaries. Revenue in this industry has seen a steady increase over the past five years, mainly driven by gains from assets held in trusts and regular dividends. The industry has benefited from strong performances in equity markets and housing price appreciation during this period. From 2018 to 2023, the industry's revenue has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8%, reaching $221.4 billion, with a projected 4.2% increase in 2023, as per IBIS World. However, we can't guarantee the accuracy of these figures.\n\nIn the world of estate planning, along with financial and investment planning, it\u2019s essential to look up various big players in the industry, namely, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

The sources used are namely, Srllp, Vaelderlaw, Wealthify, Due, and Kiplinger. We've ranked the list on discretion.\n\nWith his, let us now head on towards our list of 12 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12. Business\n\n12th one our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child is family business, which is a common asset passed down to children as an inheritance, often with monetary value and a stable income source. This can provide financial security for them in the long term. However, businesses can be unpredictable and may fail if not managed effectively. It's crucial to ensure the business is financially sound and profitable when passing it down. Teaching children how to run the business early on can prepare them for potential future responsibilities.\n\n11. Annuity\n\nAn annuity is a valuable asset to leave for children, offering stable income and potential tax advantages, particularly with non-qualified annuities funded with after-tax funds. By annuitizing the annuity, children can convert it into a reliable income source to cover living expenses for a specified period or lifetime. An annuity helps manage the risk of outliving savings or market downturns. While it provides a stream of income, annuities may have limitations in flexibility and liquidity.\n\n10. Real Estate\n\nReal estate assets, acquired through hard work, can be a valuable inheritance for children, offering financial security and potential growth over time. In addition to safeguarding retirement funds, real estate properties with shared memories can create sentimental value for the heirs. Real estate is a safe investment with potential for growth and can provide financial security for children. However, it may come with maintenance costs and management responsibilities for beneficiaries.\n\n9. Brokerage Account\n\nA brokerage account, containing stocks and bonds, offers a valuable non-cash financial inheritance that can grow in value over time. These accounts allow for active trading before being transferred to children, who can benefit from the rising asset value gradually. One advantage of brokerage accounts is their divisibility, making it simple to distribute the assets among multiple children. Moreover, stocks are easily liquidated, providing access to cash when needed through the brokerage account.\n\n8. House in a Trust\n\nPlacing a house into a trust offers several benefits, including asset protection against potential risks like creditors, avoidance of probate for a quicker transfer to beneficiaries, potential tax advantages, and the ability for the settlor to maintain control over asset management. However, there are drawbacks to consider, such as the associated costs of establishing and maintaining a trust, the loss of control once the house is in the trust, the complexity of trust management, and limited flexibility with irrevocable trusts.\n\n7. Spendthrift Trust\n\nA spendthrift trust is a type of trust that restricts a beneficiary's access to trust assets based on conditions established by the grantor. This trust structure helps prevent beneficiaries from mismanaging their inheritance and safeguards trust assets from creditors. By disbursing funds incrementally rather than as a lump sum, a spendthrift trust can be beneficial if the beneficiary lacks financial maturity, tends to make impulsive decisions, is in significant debt, vulnerable to deceit, struggling with addiction, has special needs and receives government benefits, facing or anticipating divorce, or works in a litigious industry where asset protection is crucial. The pros of a spendthrift trust include protection from creditors targeting trust assets and a controlled distribution of funds over time.\n\n6. UTMA/UGMA Accounts\n\nUTMA/UGMA accounts, or Uniform Transfers to Minors/Uniform Gift to Minors accounts are placed 6th on our list of Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child. They\u00a0are custodial arrangements that allow gifts to be held for minors who cannot own substantial assets themselves. These accounts enable a designated individual, possibly the donor, to manage the gifted funds until the minor reaches legal age, typically 18 or 21, depending on state laws.\n\nSetting up a UTMA/UGMA account is a straightforward process usually done through a local bank branch. However, the funds in the account are taxable to the child, and some investments may trigger tax consequences, potentially subjecting the child to higher tax rates. Consulting with an estate planning attorney is advisable to assess the implications. One concern with UTMA/UGMA accounts is that when the minor reaches the designated age, typically 18 or 21, they gain control of the account and can use the funds as they wish.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about 5 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n12 High Growth Real Estate Stocks that are Profitable Top 20 Most Valuable Insurance Companies in the US 15 States with the Cheapest Home Insurance in the US\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Big banks needed M&amp;A to roar back in 2024. It\u2019s happening.",
        "content": "Wall Street banks really needed dealmaking to make a comeback. It may finally be happening.\n\nThe volume of US mergers and acquisitions is up 130% so far this quarter, at $288 billion, according to data from Dealogic, while worldwide M&A is up 56% to $453 billion.\n\nThat surge includes three major deals announced this week in the US. Credit card lender Capital One (COF) said it would acquire rival Discover Financial Services (DFS) for roughly $35 billion. Charlotte based regional bank Truist Financial (TFC) said it would sell its remaining $15.5 billion stake in an insurance arm. And retailing giant Walmart (WMT) confirmed plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio (VZIO) for $2.3 billion.\n\nThe pacts could mean hundreds of millions in new fees for some of the biggest banks at a time when their traditional lending profits are expected to decline. Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) all had a hand in at least one of the transactions.\n\nThat trend \"we think will bode well for the balance of the year,\" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said Tuesday at a Bank of America Securities conference.\n\nBig banks have been waiting two years for M&A to pick back up again. Last year was supposed to be the year things turned around; instead 2023 was the worst year for dealmaking in a decade as clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy.\n\nInvestment banking revenue at the five big banks with sizable Wall Street operations fell by an average of 9% last year. The portion of these fees tied to advice given on mergers or acquisitions declined even more, by 21% on average.\n\nSome executives even had to walk back their talk of \"green shoots\" after the hoped-for surge in deals failed to materialize.\n\nA lot is riding on a Wall Street revival that sticks in 2024. That's because banks expect to see their traditional lending income drop as demand falls and margins get squeezed. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates at some point this year, and that could hurt the giant banks that were able to charge a lot more for their loans when rates were higher.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Loan growth is [a] dog fight right now,\" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at a Bank of America Securities conference Wednesday, speaking to commercial borrowing usage by his company\u2019s large corporate clients. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nMason, the Citigroup CFO, added a note of caution about the M&A pickup. Even through \"we are seeing a significant increase in announced deals,\" the number of deals actually closing in the first quarter \"have not been that high.\"\n\nThere are many uncertainties still about the prospect for M&A throughout 2024, including what the Fed does on rates and how far the Biden administration goes in its campaign to scrutinize consolidations across a number of industries.\n\nLast month a federal court sided with the Justice Department\u2019s request to block JetBlue\u2019s (JBLU) $3.8 billion acquisition of rival Spirit Airlines (SAVE).\n\nA lot of other mergers also hang in the balance due to antitrust reviews, from the tie-ups of air carriers Alaska (ALK) and Hawaiian (HA) to grocery chains Kroger (KR) and Albertsons (ACI) to amusement park giants Six Flags (SIX) and Cedar Fair (FUN).\n\n\"The one thing we can be confident of is that the Biden administration will be tougher on mergers than the Trump administration so if I were trying to pull off a big merger, I'd wait until November,\" said Cornell Law School professor George Hay.\n\nBut clearly some companies are clearly willing to roll the dice on buying rivals, including Capital One. Its purchase of Discover would create one of the largest US credit card companies and a formidable new rival to American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA). Capital One headquarters in McLean, Va. (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nCapital One predicts the deal will close in late 2024 or early 2025 if it gets that regulatory approval.\n\n\"We doubt the timing is a coincidence. The deal is unlikely to close before the elections,\" Ian Katz, a managing director for Capital Alpha Partners, said Tuesday.\n\n\"If the Republicans win, approval becomes more likely. We think approval is also possible under Biden-appointed regulators, but the proposed deal will take many months and receive intense scrutiny.\"\n\nAnother big bank, PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), has also been making some noise about getting bigger as a way of surviving long term. Its CFO, Rob Reilly, made it clear Wednesday that the bank is not that concerned about regulatory pushback.\n\n\"We think should an opportunity arise for us... we think that there would be a large degree of regulatory support under the current setup,\" said Reilly, noting that he met with acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu last week.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "(Adds Mike Ashley quotes, paragaph two and three)\n\nBy Kirstin Ridley\n\nLONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley used an \"unrealistic\" and \"inappropriate\" near $1.0 billion margin call to force trades held by retail tycoon Mike Ashley's Frasers group off its books partly out of snobbery, London's High Court was told on Wednesday.\n\nAshley, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be worth $5.2 billion, told the first day of a two-week trial that the demand for collateral by the Wall Street bank, that had spurned him as a client three years ago, had left him in \"total shock\".\n\n\"It was like a nuclear bomb hitting Slough (a town in England),\" he told the court.\n\nFrasers is suing Morgan Stanley for about 47 million euros ($51 million) over alleged costs and lost trading profits after the bank imposed the margin call - security to cover possible losses - on the retailer's trading position in German fashion group Hugo Boss in May 25, 2021.\n\nAdrian Beltrami, a lawyer for Frasers, said the bank changed the purpose of its $915 million margin call on May 28, 2021, after discovering that Frasers stood behind trades held by its client, Denmark's Saxo Bank.\n\nFrasers, which says Morgan Stanley's staff saw Ashley as an \"upstart\" with \"zero respect to the norms of the way in which we do business\", alleges the decision was capricious, in breach of market practice and designed to force it to close or move its positions and cause it harm.\n\nMorgan Stanley dismisses the claim as contrived and without merit. It says it had no contractual relationship with Frasers, only with Saxo, and alleges a margin call based on a potential 400% rise in Boss shares was designed to ensure it was properly protected from exposure to stock market bets.\n\nThe bank also brushed aside allegations of any vendetta against Ashley. It said the bank staff were horrified at the size of the Boss position at a time of heightened concern about large positions in single stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Holy crap ... we haven't seen anything this big for them (Saxo) before ... this is exactly the type of concentration we need to be worried about,\" Greg Basso, from the bank's counterparty risk division, told an internal call on May 24 - before Saxo revealed its client's identity - the court heard.\n\nCamilla Bingham, representing the bank, said Morgan Stanley could have \"exercised the nuclear right\" to force the Boss position to be closed out when the margin was not fully paid, but instead tried to resolve the problem with Saxo.\n\nThe margin call came two months after the collapse of family office Archegos Capital, in which Morgan Stanley lost $911 million.\n\nSaxo and Frasers, which eventually transferred its trades, have settled their case separately.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An email detailing a senior Morgan Stanley banker\u2019s \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d to doing business with billionaire Mike Ashley is among a trove of internal documents set to be pored over during a London trial into the bank\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d $995 million margin call.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Play Video US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year European Stocks Retreat as Earnings Disappoint: Markets Wrap\n\nThe retail tycoon\u2019s Frasers Group Plc sued Morgan Stanley and Danish lender Saxo Bank after the banks issued the massive margin call over Ashley\u2019s derivatives trade positions in Hugo Boss AG. While the claim against Saxo Bank was paused by a court, Frasers has pursued Morgan Stanley ever since.\n\nThe margin call was unfair and \u201ccapricious,\u201d Frasers\u2019 lawyers will argue during the UK trial that starts Wednesday. Simon Smith, the then-head of EMEA investment banking at Morgan Stanley, had a \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d to the prospect of doing business with Frasers, which fueled its stand on the margin call, lawyers for Frasers said in court filings citing emails.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t like him,\u201d another Morgan Stanley banker had said in a reference to Ashley, Frasers\u2019 lawyers said in their arguments.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t take part in the decision on the margin call, which was based on stress tests and standard practice, lawyers for the US bank argue. Frasers\u2019 trade positions posed significant potential risks to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThere was no \u201cirrationality\u201d on the part of Smith or the bank when it decided not to enter into any contractual relationship with Frasers, they said.\n\nBefore the dispute arose Morgan Stanley was unwilling to offer corporate and advisory services to Frasers because of Ashley\u2019s reputation, \u201cdeserved or otherwise,\u201d for being litigious among other reasons, the bank\u2019s lawyers said.\n\nAshley\u2019s retail firm was trading in options through Saxo Bank, which in turn executed them with the US bank, according to the filings. The margin call represented the risk that Hugo Boss\u2019 share price might jump by more than 400% from the strike price and cause losses.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cFrasers has never been a client of Morgan Stanley. This claim is contrived and without merit and we will defend it vigorously,\u201d a spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said in an emailed statement. Lawyers for Frasers declined to comment.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy Deepfake Audio Boom Exploits One Billion-Dollar Startup\u2019s AI\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser got a 6% pay bump for her performance in 2023, a year the bank's profits dropped 38% and Fraser began a dramatic restructuring that will result in an estimated 20,000 job cuts.\n\nThe board awarded her total compensation of $26 million, Citigroup said in a Tuesday regulatory filing. The amount includes a base salary of $1.5 million as well as $24.5 million in cash as well as deferred stock and performance based compensation units vesting in the coming years. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, testifies before a Senate committee last December. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nThe award, which was up from $24.5 million in 2022, reflected the board's \"belief that Ms. Fraser\u2019s strategic and other priorities are sound and that she is executing on them promptly and thoughtfully, with an eye towards driving long-term sustainable growth, improved returns and enhanced safety and soundness,\" according to the filing.\n\nThe $26 million for Fraser was the lowest among CEO rivals at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley who received between $29 million and $37 million. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan was the only CEO among this group to experience a compensation decline.\n\nFraser was named CEO in September 2020 and took over in February of 2021. Since then, the stock has risen more than 5%. So far this year, it has outperformed the stocks of all peers with a nearly 8% gain.\n\nFraser had a lot to navigate in 2023, including the largest profit decline among her big rivals and what she called the \"most consequential\" change to how the New York lender operates in nearly two decades.\n\nInstead of operating with two mega-divisions, she is splitting the bank into five separate units with leaders reporting directly to her. She made it clear this would mean fewer people.\n\n\"We'll be saying goodbye to some very talented and hard-working colleagues,\" Fraser wrote when she announced the moves in September.\n\nThe first layoffs began in November, affecting senior managers. In January the bank told analysts it plans to eliminate 20,000 positions by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nFraser is trying to focus the company on serving big, multinational corporations, shed what isn't profitable, and operate more efficiently.\n\nCiti has also pulled back from consumer banking in various parts of the world, having sold off nine of those businesses with plans to exit a total of 14 across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico.\n\nIt is also getting out of its US municipal bond business, dismantling yet another part of an empire amassed in the 1990s when Citigroup and its CEO Sandy Weill billed the bank as a \"financial supermarket\" that could offer any and all services needed by consumers, businesses, and governments.\n\nCitigroup reported a net loss of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from an FDIC assessment of $1.7 billion and other charges and reserves.\n\nFraser called the results \"very disappointing\" but said \"we made substantial progress simplifying Citi and executing our strategy in 2023.\"\n\nThis year, she added, would be a \"turning point.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Introduces Eight-Member Slate with Deep Experience in Governance, Finance, Legislative and Regulatory Affairs, Strategic Transformations, Transportation and the Railroad Sector\n\nProposes Jim Barber, a Proven Transportation Network Leader and Former Executive at UPS, as CEO and Jamie Boychuk, a Career Railroader and Former Executive at CSX, as COO\n\nIntroduces \"Network of the Future\" Strategy Offering Path to Significant Value Creation\n\nReleases Presentation Entitled \"The Case for Leadership, Safety and Strategy Changes at Norfolk Southern\" That is Downloadable at www.MoveNSCForward.com\n\nCLEVELAND, February 20, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ohio-based Ancora Holdings Group, LLC, its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, the \"Investor Group\" or \"we\"), who collectively own a large equity stake in Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) (\"Norfolk Southern\" or the \"Company\"), today announced the nomination of eight highly qualified, independent candidates (the \"Investor Slate\") for election to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\"). In addition, the Investor Group announced it has identified a proposed management team that includes transportation network leader Jim Barber, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer and lifelong railroad operator and turnaround expert Jamie Boychuk as Chief Operating Officer. To learn more about the Investor Slate and proposed management team, download a copy of the Investor Group\u2019s presentation, entitled The Case for Leadership, Safety and Strategy Changes at Norfolk Southern, at www.MoveNSCForward.com.\n\nThe Investor Group commented:\n\n\"Norfolk Southern, which has exceptional rail workers and the country\u2019s best customers, has suffered for years due to its Board\u2019s poor decisions with regard to the Company\u2019s leadership, safety priorities and strategy. Since the Board announced its appointment of Alan Shaw as Chief Executive Officer, Norfolk Southern\u2019s status as the worst Class I railroad has been solidified by leadership delivering industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and a tone-deaf response to the devastating East Palestine, Ohio derailment. The future looks equally bleak under Mr. Shaw, who has drawn the condemnation of policymakers and the skepticism of underwhelmed analysts and shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent months, we engaged in good faith and shared a data-centric, facts-based case for meaningful change with Norfolk Southern\u2019s Board. We privately conveyed, on several occasions, that Mr. Shaw\u2019s strategy is equal parts unambitious and impractical (despite somehow having the unanimous backing of the Board). Moreover, we privately showed that Mr. Shaw\u2019s background as a 30-year insider with a poor record of driving growth through marketing roles renders him unfit to get a second chance as Chief Executive Officer. We even met with Mr. Shaw in hopes of having him change our view. While all this was going on, however, Norfolk Southern was sending its private jet to Washington, D.C. so executives could pursue the support of regulators and the Company started requesting public support from customers as part of its planned fight against us.\n\nThe bottom line is that it is time to actually move Norfolk Southern forward. Moving ahead starts with identifying the right destination. Our slate and proposed management team believe they have the experience and strategy required to turn Norfolk Southern into a safer, more sustainable railroad that is growing profitably while also yielding more stability for customers and employees.

        "content": "LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley removed its \"dislike\" stance on Ecuador's bonds on Tuesday less than a month after adding it, saying the government had made more progress than expected although a default in the next couple of years remained a risk.\n\nNewly-announced measures such as a VAT increase should make it easier for Ecuador get a new IMF programme, the investment bank's analysts said, adding that authorities won't want to be in default when elections come around early next year.\n\n\"That said, we do not see enough reasons to move straight to a like stance,\" they added in a note laying out their view on Ecuador's bonds, most of which are languishing at less than half their face value despite a recent rally.\n\n\"All financing needs for 2024 are not in place yet and perhaps the IMF is not a done deal yet either,\" the note said. Additionally, if the country is still unable to tap funding markets come 2026, \"markets will maintain a high risk of a need for another restructuring\".\n\nEcuador, long a haven for foreign retirees, has been gripped by spiralling violence since the coronavirus pandemic battered the South American country's economy.\n\nA group of masked, armed men stormed the set of a TV station during a live broadcast last month, a presidential candidate was gunned down as he left a rally during last year's elections and hundreds of inmates have been killed in prison riots.

        "title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Secret Stock Pick? Our Top 3 Guesses",
        "content": "Warren Buffett stock picks continue to include a secret stock. Speculation was high that Buffett\u2019s mystery holding would be revealed when his company, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK.A/NYSE:BRK.B) latest 13F regulatory filing was made public. But no such luck. The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is known, has continued to ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for confidential treatment of one of his stocks. Buffett has done this before. In late 2020, he kept secret the positions he was building in oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and telecommunications firm Verizon (NYSE:VZ). So, what is the latest mystery stock?\n\nWhile the internet is awash with guesses, Barron\u2019s notes that the new stock is likely a financial company. Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in its recent filings that its cost basis in financials had gone up by $1.2 billion, while its cost basis in other groups of stocks declined. Also, Berkshire hasn\u2019t added to its existing holdings of financial stocks in recent quarters, meaning that it invested in an entirely new company. Eventually, Warren Buffett\u2019s secret stock pick will be revealed. In the meantime, here are our top three guesses.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree things might make Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) attractive to Buffett right now. First, the investment bank\u2019s main business is wealth management, making it less susceptible to economic cycles and deal-making than most other Wall Street firms. Second, Morgan Stanley is under new management with a new CEO at the start of this year, Ted Pick, a longtime insider at the bank. Pick succeeded former longtime CEO James Gorman, who retired on Jan. 1.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, MS stock looks undervalued, and Buffett remains, at heart, a value investor. Year-to-date, Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock has declined 8%, bringing its 12-month decline to 11%. Currently, the stock is trading at the same level it was three years ago and is going for 16 times future earnings estimates, which is below the average among stocks listed in the S&P 500 index. Plus, Morgan Stanley pays a hefty dividend of $0.85 a share per quarter, giving it a yield of 3.93%. And Buffett continues to prize dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt might be that Buffett is buying MS stock in hopes that it will rebound once interest rates move lower, as is widely expected later this year.\n\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) a photo of vast farmland\n\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage (NYSE:AGM), also known as Farmer Mac, checks many boxes for Warren Buffett. Essentially, the company is a bank for farmers and rural communities across America that has the backing of the federal government. The president appoints five of the 15 board members at Farmer Mac. Buffett would, no doubt, like that Farmer Mac has the backing and oversight of the government at the highest levels.\n\nAt the same time, the federal and state governments protect much of the farm sector. Owing to its close government relationships, Farmer Mac has lower interest-rate risk than most commercial and investment banks. And, manyanalysts say we\u2019re now entering a commodities super cycle, with agriculture prices set to rise. AGM stock also looks comparatively cheap right now, trading at 11 times 2024 earnings estimates. Buffett tends to buy stocks for 15 times earnings or less.\n\nFarmer Mac also pays a decent dividend of $1.10 per share each quarter for a yield of 2.38%. This year, AGM stock is down 1%. But it has gained 35% in the last 12 months and is up nearly 130% over five years.\n\nAflac (AFL) the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuffett is a big fan of insurance companies. Berkshire Hathaway already owns several insurers, including GEICO and General Re. Barron\u2019s suggests that Buffett might be targeting another insurance company in Chubb (NYSE:CB). While that\u2019s a good guess, so is Aflac (NYSE:AFL). Buffett is well-known for liking the premiums insurers collect that can be re-invested, known as \u201cthe float.\u201d Aflac would be a nice complement to Berkshire\u2019s other insurance holdings because it provides supplemental insurance coverage.\n\nAdditionally, Aflac is trading at a comparatively cheap valuation at just 10 times future earnings estimates. AFL stock pays a healthy dividend of $0.50 a share per quarter for a yield of 2.52%. Aflac\u2019s valuation is lower and its dividend is higher than Chubb\u2019s. Plus, the company generates about 70% of its income in Japan, where work and government insurance coverages are less generous. Buffett is keen on Japan right now, having placed big bets in recent years on the country\u2019s trading houses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Alexander H\u00fcbner and Emma-Victoria Farr\n\nMUNICH, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Munich is starting to steal some of German financial hub Frankfurt's limelight as foreign banks flock to the southern city, which on a clear day has views of the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe appeal lies in Munich's high proportion of DAX companies and tech start-ups, large insurers and financial investors, while the nearby mountains add to its allure.\n\nFirms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been drawn by big German companies such as Siemens, Allianz and BMW being based around Munich, while their bankers also value the quality of life on offer.\n\n\"Many decision-makers work and live here, it's a city where you can live well,\" said Dietrich Becker, head of Europe and partner at Perella Weinberg, adding that Munich had the highest concentration of clients in Germany.\n\nThe U.S. investment banking boutique was a pioneer in choosing Munich for its German base, opening its office in 2020.\n\n\"In London and Paris there is a high concentration of companies and decision-makers, in Germany that is more spread out, people are constantly on the move,\" Becker told Reuters.\n\nAlong with big established industrial and financial names, EQT and General Atlantic are among the largest technology investors present in Munich.\n\nAnd there are also aspiring German software companies and many European subsidiaries of U.S. technology firms.\n\nNext month, Goldman Sachs will be the first of the major investment banks to establish a presence in the Bavarian state capital when it opens a Munich office.\n\nThis will be Goldman's second office in Germany after Frankfurt, where it has around 400 bankers, with its Wall Street rival Morgan Stanley set to follow suit in the summer.\n\n\"We will be in Munich with a team of around 30 bankers, some of whom will move from Frankfurt but also some from London,\" Wolfgang Fink, head of Germany and Austria and chairman of continental Europe at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We want to be where our clients are,\" said Fink, adding that Munich was becoming \"more and more international\".\n\nTECH TEAMS\n\nIn the German tech sector, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are among some of the most sought-after investment banking advisers, alongside fellow U.S. giant JP Morgan.\n\n\"In terms of market value, there are around one third of DAX companies sitting here and more than ten 'unicorns', i.e. start-ups with a valuation of more than one billion euros,\" said Tammo Buennemeyer, a technology specialist who will help establish Morgan Stanley's team in Munich.\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, says it will move the team of Tobias Koester, which covers financial investors, alongside its technology, telecom and media bankers (TMT) under Macario Prieto, head of TMT banking EMEA.\n\n\"In the long term, this regionalisation is also a result of Brexit, after which more business moved to the continent for regulatory reasons,\" said Fink.\n\nFrankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam fought to be the largest beneficiary from Brexit after Britain left the European Union, with Munich proving to be an unexpected beneficiary.\n\n\"The European continent as a whole has gained importance due to Brexit,\" said Buennemeyer.\n\nPerella Weinberg partners Stefan Jentzsch and Johann von Wersebe are based in Munich, while former Deutsche Bank CFO Marcus Schenck moved from the advisory boutique to Lazard two years ago, but stayed in Munich.\n\nAnd another U.S. investment banking boutique, PJT Partners plans to open an office in Munich soon, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nMost bankers agree, however, that Munich is unlikely to rival the more internationally-open Frankfurt as Germany's banking capital, with only a fraction of them employed in the Bavarian state capital for now.\n\n\"Viewed from other European countries, Munich is certainly attractive,\" said Fink. \"But at the start of a career, many colleagues feel at home quickly in Frankfurt.\" (Reporting by Alexander Huebner and Emma-Victoria Farr; Editing by Alexander Smith)",

        "content": "The board of Goldman Sachs (GS) awarded CEO David Solomon a 24% compensation increase for 2023 despite a profit decline and a dealmaking slowdown, offering a new show of support for Solomon after his most challenging year as boss.\n\nSolomon's compensation for the year was $31 million, the bank disclosed Friday. Not only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan and Charles Scharf made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\nOnly JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance. Citigroup (C) has yet to disclose 2023 compensation for its CEO Jane Fraser.\n\nThe compensation increase could be a sign that board support for Solomon is solidifying after he spent much of 2023 attempting a tricky retrenchment from consumer lending while focusing the firm on its core strengths of trading, asset management, and investment banking.\n\nProfits were down 24% at the Wall Street giant as dealmaking slowed across the industry and the firm absorbed costs associated with its consumer lending exit.\n\nIts full-year net income of $8.52 billion was the worst mark for Goldman since 2019, Solomon's first full year in charge. The firm did, however, post a sizable gain in the fourth quarter as equities trading and wealth management rose. Goldman CEO David Solomon. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA lot is in flux at Goldman as key executives depart, raising new questions about the race to eventually succeed Solomon.\n\nOne surprise exit in 2024 is Jim Esposito, who had been co-head of Goldman\u2019s global banking and markets division and is leaving after nearly three decades. Esposito had been viewed on Wall Street as among the possible successors to Solomon.\n\nThat departure could focus attention on other potential CEO candidates, including president John Waldron, asset and wealth management head Marc Nachmann, or one of the other co-heads of the investment banking and trading operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven the board of Goldman is changing. Last month ex-Goldman CFO David Viniar was named as the board\u2019s lead director to replace Adebayo Ogunlesi, who stepped down after selling his infrastructure investment company to BlackRock. Former Goldman CFO David Viniar is now lead director of the Wall Street giant. Here he is pictured testifying before Senate lawmakers in 2010. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\nThe board awarded Solomon, who serves as board chair, $29 million in a discretionary bonus of which 70% is performance-based stock units. His $31 million in compensation also includes a base salary of $2 million.\n\nGoldman\u2019s stock peaked in August 2021, in the middle of the last dealmaking boom, at $420.73. Since Solomon was named CEO in October 2018, it has risen 72%. Year to date, the stock is down slightly.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Morgan Stanley MS has planned to lay off hundreds of workers from its wealth management (WM) division, a move that is expected to impact less than 1% of the unit\u2019s employees. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe move comes as the investment banking giant, like several other Wall Street firms, seeks to reduce costs amid economic uncertainty and concerns regarding the trajectory of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley has been focusing more on its WM segment and less on the institutional securities segment (constituting trading and investment banking) over the past few years. This is because the WM segment is less dependent on the capital markets and is a less volatile source of revenues.\r\n\r\nThe WM segment became an important profit-making unit for MS post the acquisitions of Eaton Vance and E*Trade Financial, under former CEO James Gorman.\r\n\r\nHowever, last year, the segment\u2019s revenues were flat year over year.\r\n\r\nThe job cuts will be one of the first major moves by Morgan Stanley\u2019s newly appointed CEO Ted Pick.\r\n\r\nPick has reiterated the company\u2019s target of reaching $10 trillion in assets under management.\r\n\r\nOver the past six months, shares of MS have lost 2.5% against the industry\u2019s 7.1% growth.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, MS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nJob Cuts by Other Finance Firms\n\nA few days ago, CNBC reported that Citigroup C is planning to reduce approximately 51 job roles across its wealth segment in London. The move will likely affect 10% of its wealth segment workforce, comprising 485 employees.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the job roles being eliminated would range from the post of assistant vice president to the director level. The elimination is likely to involve 21 job roles in C\u2019s private bank division.\r\n\r\nThe decision to eliminate job positions in the wealth segment comes as Citigroup aims to boost the unit\u2019s returns after discouraging results witnessed in the last reported quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the segment\u2019s efficiency ratio rose to 99% from 92% recorded in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nA chief operating officer of Citigroup stated, \u201cThe wealth business is continuing to identify areas to improve efficiency through structural changes and cost base reductions.\u201d\r\n\r\nLast month, it came to light that BlackRock BLK has been planning to eliminate 600 jobs, accounting for 3% of the company\u2019s total global workforce. The move is part of BLK\u2019s efforts to streamline operations and adapt to a rapidly changing operating environment.\r\n\r\nDespite the elimination, BlackRock remains positive about its growth prospects. By the end of 2024, the company expects to employ more workforce, as it plans to expand certain parts of its business.\r\n\r\nIn a memo to its staff, BLK\u2019s CEO Larry Fink and president Rob Kapito wrote \u201cWe see our industry changing faster than at any time since the founding of BlackRock. And, perhaps most profound, new technologies are poised to transform our industry \u2013 and every other industry.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Citibank has already held calls with global investors regarding operational procedures and is planning additional meetings, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.\n\nThis flurry of activity comes ahead of the addition of the nation\u2019s sovereign bond market to JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s global debt indexes from June, a move that may lure up to $40 billion of inflows. Foreigners own just above 2% of the government bonds, leaving ample room for more buyers. India\u2019s bonds are held mostly by local investors and this marketing campaign by foreign banks reflects the nation\u2019s weight in the index, which is at par with China.\n\nGlobal funds have already begun to increase their holdings of index-eligible bonds since JPMorgan\u2019s September announcement, adding 665 billion rupees ($8 billion) of holdings, data from the Clearing Corp. of India show.\n\nRead more: Wall Street Pivots to India as It Searches for China Alternative\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile many large foreign institutional investors have a presence in India, smaller funds are not registered. A targeted approach via calls, roadshows and one-on-one meetings is being used to lure first-time investors from financial hubs such as Hong Kong, London, Singapore, Dubai and New York, the people said.\n\nSome investors have also previously pointed to a lengthy registration process and other operational hurdles around trading the country\u2019s bonds. The outreach effort is aimed at making it easier for foreign investors to put their money to work in local bonds.\n\nDeutsche Bank and Barclays declined to comment on the story, while Morgan Stanley did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nCitigroup continues to actively engage with its global clients to showcase the India opportunity, Aditya Bagree, head of India markets, said in an e-mailed response. The bank held several roadshows across Japan, Australia, Europe, UK and the US last year, and will host its annual investor conference in March.\n\nBloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Ltd., which administers indexes that compete with those from other service providers.\n\n(Updates with Citi response)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat\u2019s Really Behind Tesla\u2019s Slowdown \u2018Playing God\u2019: This Labor Activist\u2019s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What It\u2019s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

        "content": "morgan stanley\n\nA High Court judge has rebuked Morgan Stanley after it failed to promptly hand over evidence in a $1bn (\u00a3790m) legal battle with Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group.\n\nMr Justice Pelling said the Wall Street bank\u2019s pre-trial approach to disclosing evidence \u201cundermines confidence\u201d.\n\nIt comes after the bank took weeks to hand over a new document relating to its $995m trading dispute with Frasers Group, a company owned by the retail billionaire Mr Ashley.\n\nMr Justice Pelling said: \u201cNone of this is acceptable in commercial action of this sort.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s criticism comes just days before Morgan Stanley and Frasers are set to begin their High Court trial next week.\n\nFrasers Group, of which Mr Ashley is the majority owner, is suing Morgan Stanley in a row over trades in Hugo Boss stock worth hundreds of millions.\n\nFrasers Group alleges Morgan Stanley forced Frasers to abandon its bets on the stock, costing the retail empire millions of pounds as a result.\n\nFrasers argued the move was \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d. \u00a0Morgan Stanley denies the allegations and maintains it was simply protecting itself from adverse share price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley did not deal directly with Frasers but the stock bets were closed out using a process known as a margin call, where parties are asked to deposit extra cash to backstop their investment positions.\n\nThe Wall Street bank passed a margin call to Saxo Bank, which dealt with Frasers. Mr Ashley is the majority owner of Frasers Group, which is suing Morgan Stanley in a row over trades in Hugo Boss stock - Kirsty O'Connor/PA\n\nCentral to the legal wrangle is an internal Morgan Stanley policy relating to margin calls, which the US investment bank for years claimed did not exist.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s lawyers, Clifford Chance, first discovered the risk management policy in December.\n\nHowever, Frasers was not told about the document\u2019s existence for another six weeks and only received a redacted version just hours before a pre-trial review last month.\n\nFrasers has now accused Morgan Stanley of breaching court rules by taking too long to announce its discovery and taking an overly narrow view when searching for evidence.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdrian Beltrami KC, acting on behalf of Frasers, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a case that could be described as a mere error or unfortunate oversight, it was a case of non compliance.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley apologised for the delay, but said the document is \u201cnot a game changer\u201d. The bank claimed it needed time to properly assess the document\u2019s commercial sensitivity before handing it over.\n\nHowever, Mr Justice Pelling said: \u201cWhat I can\u2019t understand is why when [the document] first came to light, it wasn\u2019t disclosed promptly as it should have been.\n\n\u201cIf it had been, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today.\u201d\n\nThe judge warned that parties must resolve the \u201clong, drawn out and highly contentious disclosure dispute\u201d before the trial begins next week.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is a danger that the trial will become derailed.\u201d\n\nThe judge also said a drip feed approach to disclosure was \u201cprecisely not what English litigation is meant to be about\u201d.\n\nThe High Court ordered Morgan Stanley to search for more potentially relevant documents and left parties to decide between themselves which keywords will be used.\n\nJames MacDonald KC, lawyer for Morgan Stanley, said: \u201cThere is an element here of looking for a needle in a haystack.\u201d\n\nHowever, the judge said he had \u201crelatively little sympathy\u201d towards Morgan Stanley given its last-minute approach.\n\nThe High Court warned that Morgan Stanley could be forced to release 71 separate documents relating to the bank\u2019s internal policies and procedures if parties cannot work together.\n\nCommenting on the lawsuit generally, a Morgan Stanley spokesman said: \u201cFrasers has never been a client of Morgan Stanley. This claim is contrived and without merit and we will defend it vigorously.\u201d\n\nThe case continues.",

        "title": "15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best strong buy stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of analyst ratings and the finance industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe financial services industry is one of the biggest in the world, and just like oil, its smooth functioning is indispensable for global economic well being. A financial firm can be of several types and cater to the money needs and requirements of a wide variety of customers. The firms can range from small, regional, and mega banks, to credit services providers, savings and loan associations, multi billion dollar asset management funds, sharply managed hedge funds, and of course, investment management companies such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBroadly speaking, while the finance industry is involved in the business of managing money, it's investment banks and analysts who are responsible for shaping investor attention. They do this by preparing stock coverage reports and assigning ratings and price targets to publicly traded companies. The share price targets, ratings, earnings, revenue estimates, and notes are the primary ways through which analysts evaluate an equity. Their opinions are also some of the most reliable indicators of a share price's movements as every earnings cycle investor reacts to a publicly traded stock's revenue and EPS meeting or missing analyst estimates, Similarly, during any business day, a share price upgrade or downgrade by mega investment banks and behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).\n\nAdditionally, just because these banks or others evaluate stocks doesn't mean that they don't get evaluated themselves. As long as they're publicly traded and are of sufficient size to justify expending resources on, the banks that analysts work for are evaluated by their peers as well with the only limitation being that analysts from, say, JPMorgan cannot write investment notes about their own bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince dozens of analysts cover big ticket names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the most common way in which share price ratings or price targets are covered in the press is by averaging them. For instance, as part of our look at ten stocks with rising share price targets, Insider Monkey analyzed data for firms such as Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Insider Monkey used share price target averages ranging from 31 analysts for Costco, to 44 analysts covering Uber's shares. This is unsurprising as well, since analysts typically work for financial services firms that are classified as Sell Side.\n\nA sell side analyst works for a bank that manages money for clients that end up buying stocks. So, if there's a potential for a stock to attract significant investor funds, then a bank is incentivized to cover it and assign share ratings and share price targets. Therefore, the fact that more analysts cover Uber than Goldman is unsurprising. After all, Uber was one of the first movers in the ride hailing application space, and while its income statement struggled to come out of a 'high growth look' that focuses on revenue instead of profit, the firm is one of the leading players in industries with disruptive potential such as urban air mobility.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best strong buy stocks to invest in so that we can see which stocks with strong buy ratings are also favorites among hedge funds. Some notable stocks in this list are Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL), and Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH). 15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close-up of a hand, counting the money from the subscription fees of the Entertainment Communication Services company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best strong buy stocks to invest in, we first made a list of the 30 most valuable stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million and share price upside greater than 50% that had Strong Buy ratings on average. Then, they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2023, and the best strong buy stocks are as follows.\n\nFor these best strong buy stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In\n\n15. Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned -3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 2.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.5%. This estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of +14.2% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.1%. The $56.83 billion and $59.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +4.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +7.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Next Coca-Cola? 3 Beverage Stocks That Investors Shouldn\u2019t Ignore.",
        "content": "Two of the most successful companies in U.S. history are centered around beverage products. Of course, I\u2019m talking about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The two firms\u2019 sodas have become well-known and popular in much of the world, with KO, in particular, becoming quite ubiquitous globally. As a result of these trends, the market capitalizations of Coca-Cola and Pepsi are a huge $257 billion and $240 billion, respectively. But other U.S. beverage firms have also been successful. For example, the market capitalizations of Keurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) are now $44 billion and $59 billion, respectively.\n\nWhile we may not see another Coca-Cola or PepsiCo in our lifetimes, the beverage sector is very lucrative for some companies. Here are three beverage stocks that can grow explosively over the long term. And who knows? Maybe one of these firms could catch fire and become the next Coke or Pepsi.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster is a leader in the U.S. energy-drink category and that category is rapidly growing. According to Statista, the revenue generated by energy drinks in America jumped 13.7% in 2022 and 12.9% in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s not surprising that Monster\u2019s top and bottom lines are also rapidly increasing. In Q3 of last year, for example, its revenue jumped 16% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income surged 40% year-over-year (YoY) to $453 million.\n\nAlso encouraging is that the revenue generated by Monster\u2019s emerging alcoholic beverages jumped 58% YoY to $42.3 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the Street is quite upbeat on MNST. In December, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) identified MNST as one of 37 high-growth stocks with low volume. In January, it identified the name as a high-quality growth stock.\n\nAnd last month, Goldman (NYSE:GS) identified MNST as one of the top beneficiaries of strong return-on-equity growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe popularity of Celsius\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) healthy carbonated energy drink offerings is growing rapidly, and the firm is taking market share in the popular category. Indeed, as I noted in a previous column, CELH\u2019s \u201crevenue soared 105% in the four-week period that ended on December 30,\u201d according to research firm Nielsen.\n\nThe firm has already expanded to Canada and intends to start selling its beverages in a wide variety of countries over the longer term. Of course, Celsius\u2019 overseas expansion should cause its growth to accelerate to even more impressive levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019 sales doubled in the first three quarters of 2024, and the fact that it\u2019s offering healthy, fairly good-tasting (in my view) products in the rapidly growing energy-drink category leaves it well-positioned to be extremely successful down the road.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gave CELH a fairly high Composite Rating of 83 out of 99.\n\nZevia PBC (ZVIA) Food Trends\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/rsi1986\n\nZeviaPBC (NYSE:ZVIA) markets its namesake sodas that, as far as I can tell, are the only carbonated beverages available on a wide scale sweetened solely by stevia.\n\nUnlike sugar, stevia has no calories or known, major, negative impact on people\u2019s health. Moreover, the chemicals used to make diet sodas, such as aspartame, have also been identified as potentially having very negative effects on humans. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer found that aspartame may cause cancer, and some indications show it could undermine memory.\n\nAs someone who drinks both Zevia\u2019s products and diet soda rather frequently, I can attest that, in my view, Zevia\u2019s sodas taste around 20% to 30% better than diet sodas.\n\nZevia\u2019s top line dropped 2.6% in Q3 versus the same period a year earlier, while it generated a per-share loss of 16 cents.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s gross margin of 45% is quite high, indicating it could increase its sales and market share a great deal by lowering its prices. What\u2019s more, the firm reported in November that it had supply chain issues and was taking multiple steps to rectify them.\n\nFinally, ZVIA reported \u201cthe world\u2019s largest retailer,\u201d presumably WalMart (NYSE:WMT), had been trialing \u201cthe brand\u2019s performance in the mainstream carbonated soft aisle.\u201d Sales of Zevia\u2019s products at WMT jumped by triple-digit percentage levels and were \u201coutperforming expectations,\u201d Zevia added.\n\nThe superior healthiness of Zevia\u2019s beverages and its success at WalMart bodes very well for the long-term outlook of ZVIA stock.\n\nGiven these points, I think it has the highest ceiling among beverage stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Top 12 Retirement Savings Tips for 55-to-64-Year-Olds",
        "content": "This article takes a look at the top 12 retirement savings tips for 55-to-64-year-olds. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on decoding retirement savings, you may go to Top 5 Retirement Savings Tips for 55-to-64-Year-Olds.\n\nOn Decoding Retirement Savings\n\nAccording to the Motley Fool, those who have more than $1 million in retirement accounts fall amongst the esteemed top 3% of retirees. It's true: a large percentage of Americans don't have the \"magic number\" they think they need to spend a comfortable retirement. In fact, according to EBRI estimates, while 3.2% have $1 million saved, only a mere 0.1% have more than $5 million stacked up for retirement. With social security funds set to deplete by 2033, depleting retirement savings, and health expenditures rising each passing day, the future isn\u2019t the golden dream many boomers previously envisioned it to be.\n\nYet, the single factor that can safeguard aspiring retirees from derailing their retirement dreams is, cue the drumroll: proactivity. After all, jumping after the same magic number isn't the right way to go about your retirement anyway. After going through all the numbers Americans have been predicting that they think is the magic figure, like the $1.8 million figure from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)'s study and the $1.25 million from Northwestern Mutual, the conclusion that can be made is that it all depends.\n\n\"Tempting as it is to put a single number on retirement, the answer to how much you'll need to save depends on the life you expect to lead.\"\n\n-Debra Greenberg, director, Personal Retirement Product Management, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).\n\nIn simpler terms, the key to determining the adequacy of your retirement funds hinges on various factors. For instance, how early or later on in life you decide to retire plays a crucial role in determining your nest egg, and so do things like how much you\u2019ve already saved or how early you started saving. Then, some states are best to retire to for taxes and costs of living, and yet again, there are worst ones, too. However, this doesn't imply that seniors don't choose to reside in the latter, does it? Aspects such as property and sales taxes, and even health expenditure also determine how much of your retirement income is left to spend on things such as rent and groceries.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Because there are so many variables, even the retirement researchers can't agree on a total dollar amount.\"\n\n- Ben Storey, director of Retirement Research & Insights at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).\n\nOver the years, numerous metrics and calculators have emerged, enabling individuals to compute a personalized savings target for a comfortable retirement. For instance, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s Financial Wellness Tracker helps individuals determine, depending on their age and how much they make, how much they should be saving annually to reach a set retirement goal, amongst other things. Similarly, there's a retirement income calculator by T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) that tells individuals the estimated probability of reaching their retirement goals. No matter what instruments you choose and which financial advisors you rely on, it is crucial to start taking steps in the right direction. The bottom line is, that even if you're 50 years old and have no retirement savings, there is hope for you. Top 12 Retirement Savings Tips for 55-to-64-Year-Olds\n\nAn elderly couple in a garden with a laptop, representing how the company empowers its customers to make the best retirement and tax-deferred investment decisions.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of top 12 retirement savings tips for 55-to-64-year-olds, we exhausted our research across various reputable sources, including Investopedia, Wise Advisor, Forbes, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Turbo Tax, and CNBC, to name a few. Next, we adopted a consensus approach to rank our retirement saving tips, awarding one point to each tip each time it was recommended by a source. These tips have been ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12. Plan your retirement age\n\nInsider Money Score: 15\n\nAccording to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW), a 55-year-old today should have at least 4.5 to 8.5 times their salary saved today. However, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) also asserts that the point of benchmarks for retirement savers is to prompt action amongst them, not to make them feel inferior or inadequate by any means. The bottom line? Individuals should start saving immediately and a starting point for them is to plan a certain age by which they plan on retiring. As an individual who has entered the 55-to-64 age category, you must already have an age in mind regarding retirement. Any health complication, if any, would help you assess how long you may be able to work.\n\n11. Devise your Social Security strategy\n\nInsider Money Score: 16\n\nMany Americans believe that social security is calculated based on their entire life\u2019s worth of work. However, the reality is that these payments are calculated based on your 35 highest income years. Also, the age at which you decide to claim your Social Security benefits will determine how much you will receive. For instance, waiting until the full retirement age can reap higher benefits while claiming early means you will receive smaller payments for the rest of your life.\n\nAccording to a study, if you're between the ages of 45 and 62 and start getting your Social Security benefits before you turn 70, you might end up losing around $182,370 in lifetime discretionary spending. Also, if you plan on working during retirement, analyze how that can impact your social security benefits as well. Understanding the impact of different claiming ages will ultimately help you project your lifetime income, as well as make informed decisions about working during your pre-retirement and retirement years.\n\n10. Explore entrepreneurial opportunities\n\nInsider Money Score: 17\n\nConsidering additional sources of income at this age is another top retirement saving tip for 55-to-64-year-olds. Anything from venturing into a small business to freelancing and even starting a consultancy business can help you save for those golden years strategically. While financial benefits are obvious in our tip, pursuing areas of work that align with your passions and goals can help you bring a sense of purpose in your late years of life as well. As an individual, the biggest draw of having a solo 401(k) is that you can allocate up to 25% of your net self-employment income, with contribution limits reaching $66,000 in 2023 and $69,000 in 2024.\n\n9. Consider adding an IRA\n\nInsider Money Score: 18\n\nStarting your retirement savings later in life, even if you contribute the maximum to your 401(k), may not provide the same relief as it would have if you had begun earlier. In such a case, or in the case your employer doesn\u2019t provide a 401(k) plan at all, another prospective option to consider is opening up an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). As of 2024, the maximum amount that an individual can contribute to an IRA is $7,000, or $8,000 for those aged 50 and over. There are two types of IRAs that you can consider opening: traditional and Roth. In a traditional IRA, your contributions are pre-tax, providing an immediate tax deduction. On the other hand, a Roth IRA offers a tax advantage through tax-free withdrawals at a later stage. Both types have different contribution limits as well.\n\n8. Use catch-up contributions\n\nInsider Money Score: 19\n\nAnother top retirement saving tip for 55-to-64-year-olds is using catch-up contributions. Individuals can make use of this facility from the age of 50, making additional contributions to their 401(k) accounts as well as their IRAs. A catch-up contribution increases the total contribution beyond the standard limit. In 2024, individuals have the opportunity to increase their annual 401(k) contributions by an additional $7,500, provided that these contributions are completed by the end of the calendar year. Following the 401(k) contribution limits, individuals aged 50 and above now have the ability to contribute a total of $30,500 to their 401(k) each year. The catch-up contribution limit is $7,500 in 2024 on top of the annual $23,000 contribution limit.\n\n7. Make use of the Savers Credit\n\nInsider Money Score: 20\n\nThe Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, also known as the Savers Credit, is a special kind of tax break granted to low-and-moderate income taxpayers who are in the process of saving up for retirement. Provided that they qualify, savers credit may reduce or even eliminate an individual\u2019s tax bills. Depending on an individual's adjusted gross income and tax filing status, they can claim a tax credit for 50%, 20%, or 10% of the first $2,000 contributed during the year to their retirement account. As explained by a Turbo Tax expert, the maximum credit amounts an individual can claim are $1,000, $400, or $200, based on their specific situation. The credit can be claimed for contributions to a 401(k), 403(b), 457 plan, Simple IRA, and SEP IRA.\n\n6. Stay away from your retirement savings\n\nInsider Money Score: 21\n\nThe best retirement advice from retirees so far is to stay away from your retirement savings, period. After an individual crosses the age of 59 and a half, they can make penalty-free withdrawals from their traditional IRA plans and IRAs. On the other hand, Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn anytime, and that too, penalty-free. There is even an IRS exception that permits workers aged 55 and over to withdraw contributions penalty-free in case they lose or leave their jobs. It's called the Rule of 55. Even though these options exist to make your life easier, it's best to avoid heading down this path for as long as you possibly can.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 5 Retirement Savings Tips for 55-to-64-Year-Olds.

        "content": "Morgan Stanley's E-Trade brokerage is bringing back its popular talking babies marketing campaign for the Super Bowl on Sunday. Credit: Screen shot from E-Trade's Super Bowl ad\n\nMorgan Stanley's wealth management business is often likened to a funnel. Now the wealth management giant is betting that a 30-second Super Bowl ad will give it perhaps its best chance ever to pour in some new clients.\n\nThe contest on Sunday between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers is already expected to draw more eyeballs than last year's Super Bowl, which itself set a record with an excess of 115 million viewers. That makes the championship game a nearly ideal opportunity to pitch the online brokerage E-Trade to perhaps millions of people who aren't making the most of money they have to invest, said Andrea Zaretsky, the chief marketing officer for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\n\nE-Trade's 30-second spot, featuring the brokerage's well-known talking babies in a round of pickleball, exhorts the audience to \"get in the game.\" Zaretsky said the tagline is an obvious reference to the Super Bowl but is also meant to encourage viewers to think about how they could be doing more with their money.\n\n\"We believe we've never been in a better position to serve clients in every walk of life thanks to Morgan Stanley's category one position,\" Zaretsky said. \"And the big game really gives us an incredibly broad and diverse audience to tell that story to.\"\n\nWide end of the funnel\n\nExecutives at Morgan Stanley have often described their wealth management business as a \"funnel.\" At its wide end sits E-Trade, the online brokerage the firm acquired in 2020 for roughly $13 billion.\n\nThe service's offers of commission-free trading and easy trading in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other common investing vehicles are meant to appeal to people with moderate amounts of investable money who want to try their hand in the market. As their assets accrue over time, Morgan Stanley's hope is that these customers will move down the funnel into full relationships with advisors.\r\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjLr4bdLPIsREAD MORE: \r\nNo running!

Now these advisors want their deferred comp\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley has set itself the ambitious goal of eventually having $10 trillion in assets under management, up from $6.6 trillion today. One big part of the plan is to use E-Trade as an entryway to the full scope of advisory services the firm has to offer.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley and many of its Wall Street rivals, the standard minimum for working with a financial planner is $250,000 in investable assets.\n\n\"Our goal is, of course, to win prospects early so we can grow with them and provide relevant products and services as their needs evolve,\" Zaretksy said.\n\nWhat $7 million will buy\n\nPutting a message before such a large audience of course isn't cheap. For a 30-second spot like Morgan Stanley's, the cost is running to $7 million on average this year.\n\nZaretsky didn't say how much Morgan Stanley paid for its ad. She noted many considerations can influence the price, including how far in advance a firm enters into a deal to run a commercial.\n\nWhatever the cost, the expenditures-per-viewer equation is likely to be favorable to advertisers this year. Not only does the Super Bowl feature two popular teams; it's also expected to benefit from the so-called \"Taylor Swift effect,\" drawing in viewers primarily interested in the romance between the Grammy-winning singer and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nCharles Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova School of Business, has seen data from market research firm YouGov showing a 2% to 3% increase in E-Trade's favorability ratings for a month after it ran previous Super Bowl ads. That's a remarkable boost, he said, at a time when the fracturing of media has made it harder than ever to obtain a mass audience for any single ad.\n\n\"It's the only venue left like this,\" Taylor said. \"The Super Bowl is completely a unique property. The Grammys, for instance, might reach 20 million or so viewers. But that is nowhere what the Super Bowl can do with almost everybody watching it all at once.\"\n\nThose talking babies\n\nIt does help that E-Trade has found a popular marketing campaign and stuck with it over the years. The online brokerage introduced its talking babies in 2008, well before the acquisition by Morgan Stanley, and ran ads in the previous two Super Bowls.\n\nMorgan Stanley's E-Trade spot, developed by the ad agency 72andSunny and directed by Randy Krallman of the production company SMUGGLER, eschews the reliance on celebrities whom many firms are turning to this year to garner attention. Instead, it takes a jab at the surging popularity of pickleball with the quip: \"It's basically tennis for babies, but for adults\"\n\n\"People really do like those talking babies,\" Taylor said. \"They do a good execution of it from year to year, and they are obviously getting good feedback.\"\n\nFinancial service firms have had a somewhat mixed history with Super Bowl ads. There were the notorious spots in the 2022 championship game featuring celebrities like Larry David and Matt Damon hawking crypto-related products. But groups like the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, whose professional credentials are considered the gold standard in the industry, have used ads aired during the big game to proselytize the need for sound financial advice.\n\nEarly release\n\nMorgan Stanley's E-Trade spot is one of about 40 ads to have been released before the Super Bowl this year. Mary Scott, an associate professor of strategic communications at Montclair State University, said firms have found that early airings help to build anticipation for Super Bowl ads in general and can help fix a particular commercial in the public consciousness for longer periods of time.\n\n\"There's always a lot of viewers who tune into the Super Bowl just for the ads,\" Scott said. \"So a lot of brands have gotten really smart and said, 'We need to do some smart marketing around our Super Bowl spots,\" because that presents an opportunity to create some early buzz.\"\n\nScott said she had her students watch the ads that have been released so far on Thursday and jot down some initial thoughts. Eventually, she'll ask them to rank all the ads and then will submit the results to USA Today for its annual Ad Meter survey of Super Bowl commercials.\n\nBut the final tallying up can't be done until after the weekend, when all of the ads will have aired. So far, Scott said, the response to E*Trade's commercial has been favorable.\n\nScott noted the students in her class are largely used to being able to skip or fast forward through ads they don't find immediately appealing.\n\n\"So it's significant that they were able to interest a group of people who aren't predisposed to watching 30- or 60-second ad spots,\" she said. \"Now I'm curious what will happen next. Because I'm betting most of my students aren't E-Trade customers.\"\n\nBuilding on the buzz\n\nZaretsky said Morgan Stanley is hoping to take any heightened attention brought about by the Super Bowl spot and build on it with a special promotional offer for people who open new brokerage accounts. Investors can now receive as much as a $1,000 deposit if they open an E-Trade non-retirement account.\n\nTo qualify, customers must transfer money in from outside E-Trade and Morgan Stanley. It also must be held in E-Trade for at least six months or the cash rewards may have to be forfeited.\n\nThe day following the Super Bowl, Morgan Stanley is also holding a new event it's calling Money Monday. Current and prospective clients can sign up to view a chat between Morgan Stanley Chief Global Economist Seth Carpenter and Nicole Lapin, a financial journalist and author.\n\nZaretsky said Morgan Stanley will be looking at a number of indicators to gauge the success of its Super Bowl ad and related promotions.\n\n\"We're going to be looking at everything from new accounts to engagement and traffic to doing some social listening,\" she said. \"All that will help us understand how it's being received. And over time, we never wanted to be a one-and-done. We want to have a long-term strategy, which is why we're super excited with Money Monday.\"",

        "content": "NEW YORK, February 08, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Morgan Stanley Investment Management (\"MSIM\") today announced the launch of its latest ETF, Eaton Vance Floating-Rate ETF (Ticker: \"EVLN\"), an actively managed senior loan strategy. EVLN is the twelfth ETF strategy brought to market since the launch of MSIM\u2019s ETF platform in February 2023 and is listed on the NYSE.\n\n\"We are pleased to expand MSIM\u2019s ETF Platform with EVLN and continue to deepen our offering with strategies that reflect our differentiated investment capabilities and client-focused approach,\" said Anthony Rochte, Global of Head of ETFs at MSIM. \"A pioneer in senior loan investment management, the industry-leading team established its loan platform thirty-five years ago and today manages over $30 billion in client assets globally. This strategy makes use of that deep loan market expertise and the in-demand ETF structure to meet the needs of a broader range of income clients.\"\n\nThe actively managed EVLN will seek to provide a high level of current income through a portfolio comprised no less than 80% in floating-rate credit investments, the majority of which are expected to be the floating-rate corporate term loans at the center of the team\u2019s investment capability. Supporting allocations to high-yield bonds and collateralized loan obligation debt tranches will broaden the opportunity set. The strategy will be managed by MSIM\u2019s investment team dedicated exclusively to loan management, delivering the same approach to credit management and portfolio construction employed in the team\u2019s mutual funds and other vehicles.\n\n\"EVLN delivers our longstanding approach to loan investing in a tradable format,\" said Andrew Sveen, portfolio manager, Head of Floating-Rate Loans and Chairman of MSIM Fixed Income. \"The strategy combines our time-tested bottom-up approach with the additional tax benefits and intra-day liquidity that the ETF structure provides.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis latest ETF complements the existing MSIM active fixed income ETF offering which includes: Calvert Ultra-Short Investment Grade ETF (CVSB), Eaton Vance Ultra-Short Income ETF (EVSB), Eaton Vance High Yield ETF (EVHY) and Eaton Vance Intermediate Municipal Income (EVIM.) MSIM launched its ETF platform in February 2023 with six Calvert-branded ETFs and expanded the platform in October 2023 with one Parametric-branded alternative income strategy, one Parametric-branded hedged equity strategy, and the three Eaton Vance-branded fixed income strategies. The platform has over $600 million in assets under management as of February 2, 2024.\n\nAbout Morgan Stanley Investment Management\n\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management, together with its investment advisory affiliates, has more than 1,400 investment professionals around the world and $1.5 trillion in assets under management or supervision as of December 31, 2023.

With offices in 41 countries, the Firm's employees serve clients worldwide including corporations, governments, institutions and individuals. For more information about Morgan Stanley, please visit www.morganstanley.com.\n\nBefore investing carefully consider the Fund's objective, risks, charges, and expenses available in the prospectus, please download one at https://www.eatonvance.com. Read carefully.\n\nRisk Considerations: There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Loans are generally associated with fixed income securities risk and are traded in a private, unregulated inter-dealer or inter-bank resale market and are generally subject to contractual restrictions that must be satisfied before a loan can be bought or sold. These restrictions may impede the Fund's ability to buy or sell loans (thus affecting their liquidity) and may negatively impact the transaction price. It may take longer than seven days for transactions in loans to settle; therefore the Fund may hold cash, sell investments or temporarily borrow from banks or other lenders to meet short-term liquidity needs. Loans to entities located outside of the U.S. may have substantially different lender protections and covenants as compared to loans to U.S. entities and may involve greater risks. Loans may be structured such that they are not securities under securities law, and in the event of fraud or misrepresentation by a borrower, lenders may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Loans are also subject to risks associated with other types of income investments. Fixed-income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In addition to fixed income securities risk, asset-backed securities are subject to the risk that various federal and state consumer laws and other legal and economic factors may result in the collateral backing the securities being insufficient to support payment on the securities. Some also entail prepayment risk and extension risk, and may become more volatile in certain interest rate environment. Collateralized loan obligations carry additional risks such as the Fund may invest in CLOs that are subordinate to other classes and the complex structure may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results. Distressed and defaulted securities are speculative and involve substantial risks in addition to the risks of investing in high yield securities, which are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. The Fund will generally not receive interest payments on the distressed securities and the repayment of principal may also be at risk. These securities may present a substantial risk of default or may be in default at the time of investment, requiring the Fund to incur additional costs. Mezzanine investments are subordinated debt securities, thus they carry the risk that the issuer will not be able to meet its obligations and that the mezzanine investments may lose value. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Illiquidsecurities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk). Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Portfolio Turnover. Consistent with its investment policies, the Fund will purchase and sell securities without regard to the effect on portfolio turnover. Higher portfolio turnover will cause the Fund to incur additional transaction costs. Active Management Risk. In pursuing the Portfolio\u2019s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable leeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis, and which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions will affect performance. ETF Structure Risks. Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. The Portfolio has a limited number of intermediaries that act as authorized participants and none of these authorized participants is or will be obligated to engage in creation or redemption transactions. As a result, shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. Cash Transactions Risk. Unlike certain ETFs, the Fund may effect creations and redemptions in cash or partially in cash. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in shares may be less tax-efficient. Trading Risk. The market prices of Shares are expected to fluctuate, in some cases materially, in response to changes in the Portfolio's NAV, the intra-day value of holdings, and supply and demand for Shares. The Adviser cannot predict whether Shares will trade above, below or at their NAV. may pay significantly more or receive significantly less than the Fund\u2019s NAV per share during periods when there is a significant premium or discount. Buying or selling Shares in the secondary market may require paying brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. New Fund Risk. A new portfolio's performance may not represent how the portfolio is expected to or may perform in the long term. In addition, there is a limited operating history for investors to evaluate and the portfolio may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.\n\nEaton Vance, Parametric and Calvert are part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When the US punished Morgan Stanley for leaking upcoming stock trades to favored clients, it kept the list of recipients secret. They include one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest players: Citadel.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHaley Loses Nevada Primary to \u2018None of These Candidates\u2019 Option China Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End Rout Tesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff Fears US Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to Europe Trump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court\n\nA trader at Ken Griffin\u2019s giant hedge fund was among a coterie of executives described anonymously in Morgan Stanley\u2019s settlements with the government, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nBeyond Citadel, recipients of stock tips described in legal documents \u2014 without being named \u2014 include people at block-trading specialist CaaS Capital Management, Segantii Capital Management and Evolution Capital Management, the people said, asking not to be identified describing confidential aspects of the probe.\n\nProsecutors haven\u2019t accused any buy-side participants that allegedly received tips of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe probe faulted Morgan Stanley for giving hedge funds advance warning as clients planned to sell slugs of stock big enough to move market prices. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission said bank employees doled out the information, with the expectation that hedge funds would short the stocks and position themselves to buy parts of a block once it hit the market.\n\nThe identity of the firms involved shows how far information traveled as Morgan Stanley bankers breached client confidentiality to bolster its franchise. While the bank\u2019s close work with some specialist firms has previously been explored, Citadel\u2019s ties to the case were less known.\n\nNot every leak resulted in hedge fund managers trading before blocks of stock were sold. In some cases the sellers aborted their plans, which is what happened on two trades that were leaked to Citadel. Industry lawyers also argued that if firms did trade, they didn\u2019t break any laws, because they hadn\u2019t signed confidentiality pacts with the bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds on the receiving end of information from a Morgan Stanley executive were \u201centitled to assume he was following his firm\u2019s rules,\u201d said Cristie Ford, a former Davis Polk lawyer who now teaches at the University of British Columbia. The nature of interactions is such that \u201csome of it is based on rumors, some of it is based on hunches, and some of it is based on hypothetical questions from equity desks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor people in the industry, there\u2019s a feeling you can skate as close to the line as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom an outsider\u2019s position the whole thing feels uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley paid a $249 million penalty to end the probe. Pawan Passi, who ran the bank\u2019s US equity syndicate desk when he was put on leave in 2021, was barred from the industry for a year by the SEC.\n\nRepresentatives for the bank and hedge funds declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to messages.\n\n\u2018Fishy\u2019 Performance\n\nSellers offloading blocks of stock have long vented frustrations about prices that slip just before a trade is executed, reducing their proceeds. Morgan Stanley, a force in block trading, was a target of scorn among envious rivals, who dubbed price declines before its sales \u201cthe Morgan Stanley fade.\u201d\n\nOne proposed trade was leaked to two hedge funds including Citadel, but the seller grew suspicious as the market price began sliding, writing to the head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s desk that the \u201cstock performance smells fishy,\u201d according to the Justice Department. The customer ultimately halted plans to offload stock that month. Citadel had not shorted that stock \u2014 radio station operator iHeartMedia Inc. \u2014 before the proposed trade unraveled, two people said.\n\nIn another example, Morgan Stanley\u2019s banker told the Citadel trader about discussions with a potential block seller. Citadel\u2019s trader then provided a thorough description of his existing short position in the stock and received assurances that when the sale proceeded, he would get an allocation large enough to cover his bearish bet and close out the trade. That sale also fell through, one of the people said.\n\nThe Citadel trader left the firm last year. His departure wasn\u2019t tied to the investigation, two of the people said.\n\nWith Frank Fu\u2019s CaaS Capital, the government identified instances where the firm shorted shares after conversations with Morgan Stanley.\n\nOne of the stocks was Star Bulk Carriers Corp., an Athens-based shipping company that the founder of CaaS had never traded before, according to the bank\u2019s deal with prosecutors, which didn\u2019t name that firm either. Morgan Stanley allocated 2 million shares from a 10.6 million-share offering to help CaaS close out a short position and make money off the trade, the settlement document says.\n\nThe block sales allegedly linked to Segantii and Evolution were tied to a London-based executive who initially worked at Segantii and then moved to Evolution. The employee subsequently had a falling out with Evolution over pay. Evolution later wrote in a court document that the trader was being scrutinized in the government\u2019s probe. No charges were ever levied against him or the firms.\n\nTipping Funds\n\nThe block-trading probe exposed a type of leaks that have long been suspected on Wall Street. It was widely known that banks engaged in delicate conversations with hedge funds to gauge their potential interest in slugs of stocks that could become available. The question was whether those conversations effectively tipped off hedge funds.\n\nSome see it as a bad look for markets, even if it\u2019s deemed legal. \u201cThere should probably be more clear rules about what the process should be,\u201d according to Eric Rosen, a former senior JPMorgan Chase & Co. trader who also ran a hedge fund.\n\n\u201cA judge once described porn as \u2018I know it when I see it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are tipped off about a huge block that\u2019s coming out and you start shorting it and then you are buying it back, it doesn\u2019t smell right to me. That just doesn\u2019t seem like a level playing field.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Ava Benny-Morrison and Bei Hu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About Layoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren\u2019t Sacred Anymore HSBC\u2019s New \u2018Wise Killer\u2019 App Vies for FX Customers The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "content": "As I noted in a previous column, Investor\u2019s Business Daily regularly publishes \u201cNew Buys of Top-Performing Stock Funds,\u201d identifying equities that top-performing stock funds bought in large quantities. Often, the biggest funds ultimately play a huge role in determining stock prices. These funds have methods of obtaining key information about companies and sectors that retail investors cannot access. For example, they may interview top industry experts or regularly speak with the CEOs of other firms within the sector to obtain more information about the opportunities and challenges facing the spaces.\n\nAs a result of these points, it\u2019s worthwhile for retail investors to keep track of and at times emulate the stock purchases of top funds. Additionally, with retail sales having risen by a strong, seasonally adjusted 0.6% in December, retail stocks should perform well going forward. Here are three names from the sector that many top funds embraced in the third quarter.\n\nRB Global (RBA) UBER Stock. Uber Layoffs.

According to Seeking Alpha columnist Caffital Research, the combined companies generated an impressive compound annual growth rate of 12.4% from 2002 to 2022.\n\nAlso importantly, RBA is likely to benefit from a reduction in interest rates this year since lower rates tend to increase the number of expensive vehicles that companies and consumers buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to climb to $3.01 this year from $2.77 in 2023.\n\nO\u2019Reilly Automotive (ORLY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nO\u2019Reilly Auto (NASDAQ:ORLY) sells auto parts to consumers and retailers.

The latter trend is likely to cause the former pattern to intensify going forward.\n\nORLY tends to benefit from higher average vehicle ages because older vehicles usually need to be repaired much more often than younger ones.\n\nIn Q3, 11 top funds bought $18 million of ORLY stock, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily. In December, Goldman Sachshad a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on ORLY.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Morgan Stanley (MS) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Morgan Stanley (MS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this investment bank have returned -5.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMorgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.38 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.32 indicates a change of +14.7% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $14.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.2%. The $56.75 billion and $59.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.8% and +4.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +7.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMorgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
