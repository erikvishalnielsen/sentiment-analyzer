        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, CAVA Group (NYSE:CAVA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for CAVA Group:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.027 = US$24m \u00f7 (US$1.0b - US$111m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024).\n\nTherefore, CAVA Group has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Hospitality industry average of 11%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for CAVA Group  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured CAVA Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for CAVA Group .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nThe fact that CAVA Group is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making two years ago but is is now generating 2.7% on its capital. In addition to that, CAVA Group is employing 126% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From CAVA Group's ROCE\n\nOverall, CAVA Group gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. Since the stock has returned a solid 59% to shareholders over the last year, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.\n\nOne more thing: We've identified  2 warning signs  with CAVA Group (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile CAVA Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "content": "As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research Brian Bolan is always hungry for a good idea. This time around he looks at a couple of restaurant stocks in order to satiate he appetite.\n\nBoth of these stocks face the challenges of food price inflation and growing labor costs. At the same time, consumers might be \u201ctrading down\u201d to these food offerings as opposed to many of the fast-casual restaurants.\n\nWingstop WING is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has more than 2000 locations across the globe. The company has a market capitalization of more than $11B and pays an $0.88 per share dividend for a 0.23% yield. The company is slated to show topline growth of 28% this year and growth that like comes at a price. The forward PE is 110x which is a lot, but as long as that solid growth continues the multiple is mostly justified.\n\nNext up is CAVA Group CAVA Which is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is in the food industry. CAVA is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant that also encompasses the Zoes Kitchen brand as well. CAVA sports growth estimates of 24% this year and 20% next year and for that growth investors are paying around 233x forward earnings.\n\nJust as in all of his Aggressive Growth Zacks Rank Buy videos, Brian reviews the earnings history, earnings estimates, growth projections and valuation before taking a look at the chart.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Retail-Wholesale group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Is Cava Group (CAVA) one of those stocks right now? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Retail-Wholesale peers, we might be able to answer that question.\n\nCava Group is one of 210 individual stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #10 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months. The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks. Cava Group is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nOver the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAVA's full-year earnings has moved 39.3% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\n\nOur latest available data shows that CAVA has returned about 86.1% since the start of the calendar year. In comparison, Retail-Wholesale companies have returned an average of 11.5%. This means that Cava Group is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.\n\nAnother stock in the Retail-Wholesale sector, Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), has outperformed the sector so far this year.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Chipotle Mexican Grill vs. Cava Group",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is probably best known for its assembly line-style fresh food preparation. Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) has also built its foundation on the same concept, but with the distinction that Chipotle focuses on Mexican food while Cava specializes in Mediterranean fare. The latter, of course, is a much smaller chain, which makes the comparison with Chipotle extra interesting. Which is a better investment right now?\n\nChipotle is a huge success story\n\nEvery restaurant chain starts from modest beginnings, but not every restaurant chain can grow to have 3,500 locations like Chipotle. Sure, McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands'(NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell are both much larger, but they've also been around for a lot longer than Chipotle. Chipotle, in fact, has only been a public company since 2006, when it held its initial public offering. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBy just about any measure, Chipotle is a standout in the restaurant sector today. And the chain continues to execute at a high level, with first-quarter sales rising a huge 14.1% and same-store sales, which looks at sales for locations open for at least a year, up a very impressive 7%. That speaks to a management team that is firing on all cylinders, operating its current fleet at a high level, which is captured in the same-store number, while also adding new locations that boost overall sales.\n\nThere's a reason why Chipotle's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 60. While that's below the five-year average of around 70, it is still quite high on an absolute basis. Investors are paying up for a fairly large company that they expect to keep growing strongly.\n\nThat's entirely possible, but growth becomes more and more difficult to achieve the larger you get. It's a numbers game. Adding one restaurant when you own only one restaurant is a 100% increase in the store base. But the third location is only a 50% increase. The more restaurants you add, the slower the expansion rate becomes. Still, for more conservative investors looking to invest in growth stocks, Chipotle's proven success will be very compelling. Just go in knowing you are paying a big premium, noting that McDonald's P/E is only 22 and its five-year average P/E is 27.\n\nCava is all about the potential\n\nBy comparison, Cava is a tiny little restaurant chain with just 320 or so locations. But it opened 14 new sites in the first quarter of 2024. All told, the store base grew a huge 22% year over year! That's a number that would be almost unthinkable for Chipotle, which speaks to the opportunity ahead for Cava.\n\nStory continues\n\nCava is coming off of a very strong run. In 2023 its sales increased nearly 60% and its same-store sales rose by almost 18%. Those just aren't sustainable figures and they will probably make 2024 results look a bit less exciting because the company will be comparing against truly astounding growth figures. For example, first-quarter 2024 sales \"only\" rose 30% or so while same-store sales were up just 2.3%. Obviously, 30% sales growth is still very strong, but the 2.3% same-store figure is respectable for a fast-food company, though nowhere near as enticing as 18%.\n\nBut if Cava can keep expanding its store count and just maintain that low-single-digit same-store sales growth, it will still be a very fast-growing restaurant chain. And that, in a nutshell, is the investment thesis. There's one small problem, though. Cava is a very young company, having only held its IPO in mid-2023. Given that the P/E ratio is a massive 225, investors are clearly pricing in a lot of success in the years ahead (and probably looking at Chipotle to gauge its long-term potential). If the company lives up to expectations, it could be well worth the price and risk. If not, well, Wall Street is littered with restaurants that have crashed and burned.\n\nThe bottom line: There's more long-term growth opportunity with Cava than there is with Chipotle. But that opportunity is far from certain, which will make Cava most appropriate for aggressive growth investors.\n\nCava vs. Chipotle: Which one wins?\n\nThere are a few simple answers here and some more complex ones. For example, neither Chipotle nor Cava pay a dividend, so don't buy either if you are an income investor. And given the lofty P/E ratios, value investors may want to pass as well. But if you are a growth investor, you might find each of them of interest.\n\nThe difference is going to be whether you want to pay up in a big way for potential growth from a company with a short operating history or pay up in a more modest way for potential growth from a company with a solid track record of expanding over time. Or, to put it another way, most growth investors will probably find Chipotle more interesting while those looking to swing for the fences will likely be more attracted to Cava.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

In the long run, shareholders benefit from holding growth stocks.\n\nHere are three growth stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), the company behind Hoka sneakers and Ugg boots, has been a perennial top performer. The stock is up 65% over the last 12 months, including a 34% gain this year. With the share price hovering around $900, Deckers has announced a six-for-one stock split. DECK stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on September 9, following approval by shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting.\n\nIf approved, this will be Deckers Outdoor\u2019s second stock split. The company previously split its stock on a three-for-one basis back in 2010. The latest stock split will lower the share price to about $150 based on where it\u2019s currently trading. DECK stock has gained 418% over the last five years due to strong sales of its footwear products, which also include Teva sandals. Deckers Outdoor is a growth stock worthy of consideration.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nMediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) has been a runaway success since its initial public offering (IPO) a year ago. CAVA stock has risen 113% over the last 12 months. Analysts and investors love the company\u2019s rapid growth and its profitability, which is not the case for most new public concerns. The success to date has many analysts referring to Cava as the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).\n\nCava\u2019s most recent financial results were certainly encouraging, with the company beating Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines and raising its forward guidance. Cava reported first-quarter EPS of 13 cents, more than double the five cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year earlier. Cava opened 14 new restaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its count across the U.S. to 323 outlets.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement raised its forward guidance, saying it expects to add 50 to 54 new restaurant locations in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 48 to 52 outlets. Cava also expects same-store sales to grow between 4.5% and 6.5% this year, from an earlier forecast of 3% to 5% growth. This is a company that\u2019s firing on all cylinders.\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the technology sector, we have specialty glassmaker Corning (NYSE:GLW). The company\u2019s shares have been on fire ever since it raised its forward guidance ahead of its second-quarter earnings report, which is scheduled for July 30. Specifically, Corning said that it expects revenue of $3.6 billion, compared with previous guidance that had called for $3.4 billion in Q2 sales. In terms of profit, Corning is now forecasting EPS at the \u201chigh end\u201d range of 42 cents to 46 cents.\n\nCorning stock has increased 18% since lifting its Q2 outlook, bringing its gain on the year to 50%. Investors have been piling into the stock after management said they are seeing increased sales as demand rises for its optical connectivity products for artificial intelligence (AI). Corning has sold off its consumer product line, including its cookware division, and now focuses exclusively on specialty glass used in optics for technological and scientific applications.\n\nGLW stock pays a quarterly dividend of 28 cents a share, giving it a yield of 2.44%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in DECK and CAVA.

        "content": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Says You Should Buy These 10 Stocks. Since CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer last week talked about the decline of tech stocks after the latest CPI report, saying investors \u201cabandoned\u201d tech stocks like \u201crats from the sinking ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was titanic! They took their money and went all in on small and medium-sized companies we call the Russell 2000 because we got a much softer than expected consumer price index.\u201d\n\nCramer said that the latest CPI number shows inflation \u201chas been beaten\u201d and interest rates are \u201ccoming down.\u201d The CNBC host said if we keep getting positive data, he won\u2019t be surprised to see not one but two or three rate cuts this year.\n\nCramer wondered how major tech companies could fall on the low inflation numbers, and answered his own question by saying that sometimes in the backdrop of lower bond yields stocks of companies that \u201cneed lower rates\u201d can suddenly rise.\n\n\u201cWhat happened today always happens when rates plunged,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that there isn\u2019t enough positive data available yet to keep supporting this rally of stocks that benefit from lower rates, adding that such short-term rallies last for about three days. Cramer predicted that big tech stocks will be back after a \u201cfew more plunging days.\u201d\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s bullish on. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here\n\n). Does Jim Cramer Say You Should Buy CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)?\n\nCAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nJim Cramer has been bullish on restaurant chain CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) lately and in a latest program reaffirmed his positive outlook on the stock. Over the past one month Cava shares have pulled back 6%, but Cramer thinks you should not \u201cpanic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic, understand that they\u2019re coming down, just as a sector rotation.\u201d\n\nLast month, CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) reported upbeat Q1 results and hiked full-year guidance. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) now sees 2024 restaurant comparable sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, compared with the consensus estimate of +4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was increased to $100 million to $105 million from a prior outlook for $86.0 million to $92.0 million. \u00a0CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) average unit volume (AUV) has impressed investors while its restaurant-level profit margins, guided to 24% for 2024, are also upbeat given the current market environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nCAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) shares have gained about 124% so far this year and the stock\u2019s P/E ratio is now 224, triggering valuation concerns. \u00a0While CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) has reported closed to 30% YoY sales growth over the past couple of quarters, Cava\u00a0 bears say the company might not be able to sustain its comparable sales growth down the road as comp sales growth is easy to achieve during early growth stages. They also say most of CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) store footprint spans rich neighborhoods with high population density, and as CAVA expands its store footprint to other areas its profit from growth might moderate. The stock\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 370 is outlandishly higher than industry average of 16.65. Average Wall Street price target on the stock is $87, below its current price of $91.\n\nNext Century Growth Small Cap Strategy stated the following regarding CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) is a fast casual restaurant chain serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine, featuring customizable bowls and pitas. CAVA currently owns and operates >300 stores, and the company targets a 15% plus new store growth rate. The intermediate goal is to have 1,000 stores by 2032 with plenty of opportunity to grow beyond that level. The company already delivers solid restaurant level margins >20% and they believe 3-5% same store sales growth is achievable over time. As the business matures, they should be able to leverage G&A expense which should lead to strong earnings growth over many years.\u201d\n\nOverall, CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer Says You Should Buy These 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAVA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Cava vs. Chipotle: Which Is the Better Restaurant Stock?",
        "content": "Fast casual dining has become one of the most popular options for diners over the last several years.\n\nTwo leading fast casual restaurant chains are Mediterranean-inspired CAVA Group(NYSE: CAVA) and burrito specialist Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG).\n\nSo far in 2024, Cava stock is up 98% while shares of Chipotle have gained 25% -- each handily topping the S&P 500.\n\nLet's dive into the business results of Cava and Chipotle and assess which stock might be the better buy for long-term investors.\n\nAnalyzing Cava\n\nWhen analyzing restaurant businesses, metrics such as new store openings and same-store sales can be useful.\n\nDuring Cava's first fiscal quarter of 2024 (ended April 21), the company opened 14 net new restaurants. This represented 23% growth year over year, and brought Cava's total restaurant count to 323.\n\nThe company's revenue soared 30% year over year during Q1 to $256.3 million, while same-store sales rose by 2.3%.\n\nDespite a macroeconomic environment battling stubborn inflation, Cava has also showcased a commitment to strong unit economics. For the period ended April 21, Cava reported net income of $14 million, compared to a loss of $2.1 million last year.\n\nMoreover, the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) essentially doubled year over year during Q1, while free cash flow swung to $4.7 million compared to cash burn of $13.4 million last year.\n\nAll things considered, Cava's financial profile is quite impressive. However, with the stock surging 98% so far in 2024, investors need to assess the company's valuation. CAVA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAs seen in the chart above, Cava's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 11.7 is considerably above Chipotle's. In a way, this could make some sense. Chipotle is a much more mature business compared to Cava. However, the valuation disparity between the two restaurant stocks is hard to overlook.\n\nLet's dig into Chipotle's business and see whether Cava's premium valuation is deserved. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnalyzing Chipotle\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, Chipotle reported revenue of $2.7 billion -- an increase of 14.1% year over year. While this level of revenue growth is only about half as much as Cava's during the first quarter, Chipotle is clearly a much larger business, considering that its revenue is more than 10-fold that of Cava's.\n\nWhere Chipotle really sets itself apart from the competition is same-store sales and profit margins.\n\nDuring Q1, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales rose 7% -- more than triple Cava's sales. The company's restaurant level operating margin was 27.5%. In comparison, Cava's restaurant level profit margin was 25.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of Q1, Chipotle boasted nearly 3,500 locations -- roughly 10 times Cava's number. The company's average restaurant sales of $3.1 million were notably higher than Cava's $2.6 million.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe trends explored above suggest that Chipotle has superior unit economics to Cava. It's a much bigger company and outperforms Cava in just about every important financial and operating metric.\n\nMy suspicion is that a lot of capital has poured into Cava stock with the underlying thesis that the company might be the next Chipotle. While this has some merit, it is going to take many years to determine if Cava will eventually reach the size and scale of Chipotle.\n\nAll the while, Chipotle isn't exactly giving investors reasons to think its own growth could begin decelerating or plateauing. While money can be made owning both Cava and Chipotle stock, I see one clear winner here: Chipotle.\n\nI think Chipotle represents a best-in-class brand among restaurant stocks, and the company's impressive financial profile and key performance indications suggest that the growth narrative should stay intact for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

Buffett famously said, \u201cThe stock market is a device to transfer money from the \u2018impatient\u2019 to the \u2018patient.'\u201d\n\nWhile patience is certainly a virtue when it comes to investing, it also helps to identify strong companies when they first come to market and take a position early in their life as a publicly traded concern. This is when companies are experiencing rapid growth and have a long runway ahead of them. Spotting winning overlooked growth stocks, taking a position early and holding on for the long-term is a recipe for success as an investor.\n\nHere are three overlooked growth stocks for patient investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) has only been publicly traded for a year but has enjoyed an incredible run. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in June 2023, CAVA stock has increased 150%. The company is also profitable and has reported financial results that consistently top Wall Street forecasts. This makes Cava Group one of the most successful IPOs of the last five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong financial results are driven by huge growth, which continues to create an enormous market opportunity. For this year\u2019s first quarter, Cava reported EPS of 13 cents, more than double the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year earlier.\n\nMuch of the growth came from Cava\u2019s rapid expansion as the company opened 14 new\r\nrestaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its national count to 323 outlets. According to management, Cava is now forecasting full-year earnings of $100 million to $105 million. That\u2019s an increase from an earlier forecast of $86 million to $92 million. Many analysts compare Cava to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s one stock that has had an even more impressive market debut than Cava Group, it\u2019s British microchip and semiconductor concern Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM). Since going public in September 2023, ARM stock has risen 200%. And more gains appear likely. The growth trajectory of ARM stock has been so strong that the company was just added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing satellite radio provider Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI).\n\nStory continues\n\nArm Holdings was added to the Nasdaq 100 due to its explosive market capitalization approaching $200 billion. Like Cava, Arm is already profitable and growing at a brisk clip. The company most recently reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $928 million, a 47% increase from a year ago. Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is powering its sales growth. In terms of profit, Arm earned 36 cents per share, beating forecasts of 31 cents a share.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) Light blue pills on white background. Pharmaceutical industry, medical treatment, presciption drugs concept. Digital 3D render., biotech stocks, big pharma. EVAX stock\n\nSource: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorried that you\u2019ve missed out on the boom in weight loss drugs with pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Not to worry. You can still gain exposure to the weight loss drug trade with Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), the newest and potentially most explosive entrant in the weight loss drug market. VKTX stock is up 180% this year on reports that its weight loss candidate has shown extremely good results.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another reason to consider Viking Therapeutics stock. Rumors that a larger pharmaceutical company such as\u00a0Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) might acquire Viking Therapeutics to gain access to its weight loss drugs acting as a catalyst for the stock too. Whether Viking remains independent and brings its weight loss drug to market or is acquired by a larger company at a premium price, investors don\u2019t look likely to lose with VKTX stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in LLY.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Can Double Again in 2024",
        "content": "There are just a little more than 30 U.S. exchange-listed companies with market caps greater than $1 billion that more than doubled in the first half of this year. It's fair to say that most of them won't repeat the feat through the final six months of 2024. It doesn't mean that all of them won't deliver an encore performance.\n\nCava(NYSE: CAVA), Hims & Hers Health(NYSE: HIMS), and Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG) are among handful of names that have already doubled this year. They have a shot at doubling again before the end of 2024. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Cava Group: Up 116%\n\nInvestors are often smart to steer clear of freshly minted IPOs, but Cava has proven to be a tasty exception to the rule. The fast-growing chain of Mediterranean fast-casual restaurants went public at $22 in the springtime of last year. It nearly doubled to $42.98 by the end of 2023. It has gone on to more than double this year, a four-bagger for those who got in on the IPO less than 13 months ago.\n\nCava closed out its latest fiscal quarter with 323 locations, but it's less than a third of the way to its goal of having 1,000 locations open by 2032. The brand's growing appeal and some of its unique product offerings have also translated well to the upscale grocery level as a seller of consumer packaged goods. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowth and top-line store-level performance have slowed since Cava's first quarter as a public company when revenue soared 62% on the strength of brisk expansion and an 18.2% jump in comparable-store sales. Revenue in its latest report rose 30%, fueled largely by a 23% surge in its open locations. Comps rose a mere 2.3%, and a closer look could prove problematic. The modest comps figure is the result of a 3.5% increase from menu price and product mix, weighed down by a 1.2% decline in guest traffic.\n\nThis isn't as problematic as it seems. For starters, Cava's scalability has scored it better-than-expected profitability in every quarter as a public company. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly doubled in its latest quarter.\n\nWatching a hot chain go through a slowdown in traffic can be scary, but Cava actually raised its guidance when it announced its first-quarter results in late May. It was initially eyeing a 3% to 5% increase for the entire 2024 fiscal year. Now it's eyeing a 4.5% to 6.5% increase. Put another way, business is expected to pick up again at the store level to give the aggressive chain expansion more oomph.\n\n2. Hims & Hers Health: Up 127%\n\nThe promise of telehealth is a win-win on paper. Using videoconferencing to connect someone requiring a medical consultation with a licensed or trained professional is cheaper, faster, and more discreet than conventional in-office visitations. However, the medium has generally failed to deliver profitable and sustainable growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHims & Hers Health could be the exception. Hims was founded seven years ago, initially leaning on telehealth to sell hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatments that require a medical prescription. It would go on to double its target audience by launching Hers, offering birth control and flibanserin. It would eventually tackle mental health, and earlier this year it became a source to secure the wildly popular GLP-1 weight loss injections.\n\nGrowth has been stellar. Revenue gains have clocked in at 46% or better for every quarter since the company went public three years ago. It has finally broken out of the red, clocking in with back-to-back quarters of profitable results. There are regulatory risks here if there's a crackdown on telehealth prescriptions, but it may be too late to put that genie back in the bottle.\n\n3. Sweetgreen: Up 167%\n\nLet's close out with another fast-growing restaurant chain. In a year in which tech and crypto dominate the names of stocks that doubled, Sweetgreen is living up to its name for its fortunate 2024 investors. The company's fast-casual eateries specializing in premium salads and warm bowls are rocking, and the stock's 167% year-to-date burst makes it one of 2024's biggest consumer-facing gainers.\n\nUnlike Cava, Sweetgreen was a dud after its initial IPO pop. It went public at $28 in 2021, briefly trading north of $50 before whittling its way down to the high single digits by late last year. The starting line matters here. Sweetgreen is growing roughly in line with Cava these days. Revenue rose 26% in its latest quarter on a 5% uptick in comps. However, it's still not profitable.\n\nThe catalyst for continued growth here is similar to what could drive Cava higher. These are high-end fast casual concepts that appeal to young and affluent professionals. The return to in-office work should continue to drive weekday lunch traffic to both chains, and brand appeal should only continue to grow as the year plays out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

Since CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) ranks 9th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program discussed the changing consumer trends in the US, wondering whether the consumer is just \u201cfed up\u201d of paying high prices and becoming \u201cfrugal.\u201d Cramer said this \u201cfrugal thesis\u201d is not \u201cobvious\u201d but he has recognized this latest trend based on some new developments. Cramer named a few consumer companies that are benefitting from the changing consumer behavior because of their discounted price offerings. Cramer rejected the notion that dollar stores are cheap. He said these stores raise prices \u201caggressively\u201d and calling them dollar stores has become a \u201cmisnomer.\u201d The CNBC host said the consumers \u201cwant prices lower\u201d and that\u2019s why dollar store companies are getting crushed in the new environment.\n\nJim Cramer also said the \u201crenting society\u201d is winning the \u201cowning society,\u201d pointing to a new trend where consumers are renting boats instead of buying them to enjoy the experience without spending a fortune.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked some stocks he\u2019s recommending investors to buy or sell.

Is CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) Stock to Buy and Sell Before the Third Quarter 2024 According to Jim Cramer?\n\nCAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nRestaurant chain company CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to buy on the dip. Here is what Cramer said during a latest program\u201d\n\n\u201d CAVA feels like it has the possibility of being a Chipotle.\u201d\n\nCramer said he knows the stock had a \u201cbig spike\u201d recently, but he\u2019d buy more CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) shares if the stock comes down.\n\nLast month, CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) reported upbeat Q1 results and hiked full-year guidance. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) now sees 2024 restaurant comparable sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, compared with the consensus estimate of +4.5%.

They also say most of CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) store footprint spans rich neighborhoods with high population density, and as CAVA expands its store footprint to other areas its profit from growth might moderate. The stock\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 370 is outlandishly higher than industry average of 16.65.

        "title": "3 Excellent Stocks That Can Beat the S&amp;P 500",
        "content": "We all want to beat the market. It's easier said than done, but doing your homework can give you an edge on the standard portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) these days. Here are three stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 that I think can do it again over time.\n\n1. Apple\n\nAn investment gem for years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was in the news a few weeks ago for becoming more valuable than Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The company has outpaced the S&P 500 by 234% over the last five years.\n\nIt is one of Warren Buffett's favorites, and for good reason. Its products have lots of utility, and the phone and computer businesses have a significant barrier to entry. You need deep pockets and infrastructure to get involved in this game. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNaysayers to my Apple pick will likely point to last year's 2.8% decline in revenue and the weak first quarter of 2024. What I think is being missed here is the potential demand that Apple could create from the integration of AI-based programs into its products.\n\nMost recently, the chatter around Apple has been its announcement of Apple Intelligence, its planned AI business, and potential partnership with Meta Platforms on generative AI. This could be exactly what Apple needs to gain the momentum seen by stocks such as Nvidia, whose semiconductor chips are essential to AI-based businesses.\n\nI like Apple as a play on this burgeoning business, since it stands to be a new source of demand for the tech company. It has the product lineup necessary to implement AI in a way that will appeal to its large consumer base. As I said before, Apple's devices offer a lot of utility. Integrating AI into them only stands to increase that advantage.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) is a blue chip gem. The discount king creates consistent annual growth and earnings for shareholders, and its low-price strategy positions it well in our inflationary economy, where consumers are looking for the best deals.\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's late partner, loved Costco, and it's easy to see why. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by 134% over the last five years, using a strong member base that drives comparable store sales (comps). In the first 16 weeks of the company's fiscal year, total comps increased by 4.7%, with a 12.6% increase in e-commerce. May sales results showed comps gained 6.4%, with e-commerce sales gaining 15.3%.\n\nThose figures don't match Nvidia's, but the key here is consistency and profitability over time, and a business model that is beneficial to consumers at any time. Costco has averaged double-digit revenue growth over the last five years, just a part of years of revenue and net earnings increases, and there seems to be little sign that the story will change.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Cava\n\nWish you could go back and buy into Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) before it was Chipotle? Cava Group(NYSE: Cava) just might be your shot.\n\nThe latter restaurant chain operates very similarly to its Mexican counterpart but focuses on Mediterranean cuisine. I'd challenge you to find many competitors of scale in the Mediterranean space, and Cava might be a great long-term play.\n\nHaving gone public only last year, Cava shares have beaten the S&P 500 by roughly 100% in that time. The restaurant chain has seen significant growth as it pushes to create a similar story to Chipotle. First-quarter revenue increased 30.3% year over year to $256 million, while its total number of restaurants increased 22.8% year over year, to 323 locations.\n\nFor being such a young company, and a quintessential growth stock, Cava has found profitability particularly early, making $13.28 million last year. To be fair, that's not significant on a per-share basis, amounting to a mere $0.12 per diluted share, but compared to a loss of $1.30 the year prior, I like seeing a company focused on profitability early.\n\nFull-year guidance is looking for comps growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, with net new-store openings of 50 to 54.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Cava Group (CAVA) reached $92.75, with a +1.29% movement compared to the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.41%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.71%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the Mediterranean restaurant chain had lost 1.7% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.65% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.53% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Cava Group in its forthcoming earnings report.

        "title": "Is Cava (CAVA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CAVA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in CAVA?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Cava, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 29% over the past month to $0.34.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Cava. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Cava may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Fast food chains lean into value this summer. Will it be enough to boost their lagging stocks?",
        "content": "Value is on the menu this summer.\n\nRestaurant chains such as Taco Bell (YUM), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), KFC, and Burger King (QSR) have been leaning into value deals this summer in hopes of getting Americans to visit their restaurants more often and spend more when they do.\n\nIt's an attempt to turn around the narrative that fast food has gotten too expensive. Quick-service restaurant sales have finally started to flag after chains hiked prices over the past few years to offset higher labor and commodity costs, deterring diners, especially lower-income consumers.\n\nThat shift has been reflected in the hit to restaurant stocks this year. Shares of McDonald's and Wendy's (WEN) are both down 13% year to date, while shares of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International are down 11.3% and YUM! Brands is up just 1%.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX), which calls itself an affordable luxury, is now struggling to encourage investors it still is, with shares down 18% in 2024. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), meanwhile, is up nearly 15%.\n\nEnter value meals \u2014 which Wall Street pros say could boost foot traffic but lower margins.\n\nMany will be watching closely throughout July, which Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer called a \"pivotal month for the fast food industry,\" for proof that the \"$5 meal bundle is enough to accelerate industry sales.\"\n\nThe limited-time value deal comes down to a simple proposition: When value strategies work, it's because increased foot traffic offsets lower margins to bring in more dollars, Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop said. Consumers adding more items to their checks also helps.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to \u2026 repeat visits after the fact,\u201d R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cYou're not making money on the value menu. You're making menu money on the other products, the more premium products, the dessert products, the beverage products that go along with that.\u201d Customers place orders at a McDonald's restaurant at a shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on April 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Vincent Thian) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhile consumers may be happy about the cheaper prices, it's not guaranteed to be a good deal for fast food companies. And more competitors in the value arena could lead to no clear winner in the end.\n\n\"A value war is good for no one,\" Dunlop said. \"It's also the typical reaction that we see when industry traffic slows down. ... Everyone's dominant strategy when traffic is down is to promote, discount, and lean into value, but all players lose if their peers also make that choice.\"\n\nValue battle heats up\n\nOn Thursday, Taco Bell was the latest quick-service restaurant to introduce a value offering. With a name that plays on the idea that fast food is now a luxury, the $7 Luxe Box menu includes a Chalupa Supreme taco, beefy five-layer burrito, double-stacked taco, chips and nacho cheese sauce, and a medium drink.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company said the bundle provides a 55% discount on the total price of the items if they were bought separately. And Nola Krieg, who is behind product development at Taco Bell, said the box echoes previous $5 box deals the taco chain has offered since the late 2000s.\n\n\"What we found is an opportunity to give consumers an ... abundant meal at a price that everybody can afford, at $7,\u201d Taco Bell chief marketing officer Taylor Montgomery told Yahoo Finance, also hinting that other chains' value offerings may not be as hearty. Taco Bell introduces the $7 Luxe Box menu, which includes a Chalupa Supreme, Beefy Five-Layer Burrito, Double Stacked Taco, chips & Nacho Cheese sauce, and a medium drink. (Yahoo Finance at Taco Bell HQ in Irvine, Calif.)\n\nTaco Bell's offering compares to others rolling out across fast food. McDonald's $5 value menu, which began Tuesday, includes the choice of a McDouble burger or McChicken sandwich in addition to a four-piece chicken McNuggets, small fries, and a small soft drink.\n\nSimilarly, KFC's $4.99 meal offers two pieces of chicken, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and a biscuit, while Burger King\u2019s $5 Your Way Meal includes the choice of a Chicken Jr., Whopper Jr., or bacon cheeseburger to go with fries, nuggets, and a drink.\n\nWendy's also sweetened the deal for its $5 Biggie Bag, an ongoing deal introduced five years ago, by throwing in a free Frosty. And even Starbucks is offering a \u201cpairing menu.\u201d For $5 or $6, customers can get a small iced or hot coffee with a butter croissant or breakfast sandwich.\n\nAnd while promotions are back in a big way, this tasty competition isn't new in the industry.\n\nIn 2016, McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's competed over price. McDonald's had its McPick $2 menu, Burger King had a five-for-$4 meal deal, and Wendy's had a four-for-$4 deal. All saw a 3% to 5% sales boost in the first quarter of 2016.\n\nFast food back in focus\n\nSo, is it working this time around? Preliminary results show these deals just might be.\n\nOver the \u201clast two weeks in particular, we started to see [fast food restaurants] come back into the focus of a lot of consumers as these value menus rolled out,\u201d Hottovy said, adding that this \u201cextreme value is really resonating with consumers right now.\u201d\n\nBurger King is \u201cdefinitively\u201d seeing positive traction from its $5 promotion, Hottovy noted, while Wendy\u2019s ongoing $5 Biggie Bag and Frosty freebie seem to be luring customers in too.\n\nMost of these runs are for a limited time only, though, so time will tell if these promotions play out favorably for fast food giants, especially as grocery stores and casual dining chains like Cava (CAVA), Chipotle (CMG), and Sweetgreen (SG) offer customers competitive alternatives.\n\nIf the deals aren't compelling enough to boost traffic, the chains may be reluctant to renew them.\n\n\u201cIt's reasonable to expect that [if] franchisees do not see incrementality in profit, they're going to be pushing back, and they're going to be unhappy with signing off on a ... subsequent promotion,\u201d Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance.\n\nEvercore's Palmer believes the success of these deals comes down to who can best communicate them to consumers.\n\n\"We suspect the answer will come in the advertising effectiveness \u2014 will it leverage McDonald\u2019s $1 billion national advertising budget?\" he wrote. \"Should McDonald\u2019s be able to stabilize traffic with value in 3Q the steady stream of new products in 2H24 and 2025 should kick off a substantial brand recovery.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "After reaching an important support level, Cava Group (CAVA) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. CAVA surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nLike other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend. Moving Average Chart for CAVA\n\nCAVA has rallied 13% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests CAVA could be on the verge of another move higher.\n\nOnce investors consider CAVA's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has been lowered in the past two months, compared to 7 raised estimates, for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.\n\nInvestors should think about putting CAVA on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It's since expanded into women's health, now offering healthcare consumers access to products and services across a range of practice areas. Hims & Hers partners with an extensive network of licensed healthcare providers while also offering a platform that features cloud pharmacy fulfillment, digital prescriptions, and an electronic medical records system.\n\nHealthcare consumers increasingly want the ease and flexibility of telehealth options. Hims & Hers makes the process seamless, from speaking with your healthcare provider to getting a prescription to enjoying free shipping of the product to your front door.\n\nMore recently, the company expanded its footprint to include weight loss treatments. In a time where treatments like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy (Ozempic is the version approved for diabetes) and Eli Lilly's Zepbound are raking in billions, Hims & Hers recently announced that it would now offer access to GLP-1 injections in addition to weight management oral medication kits. These compounded GLP-1s purport to include the same active ingredient as Wegovy at lower costs than the branded medications.\n\nStory continues\n\nHims & Hers reported revenue of $278 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 46% year over year. It managed a gross margin of 82% while net income was $11.1 million. The company also delivered free cash flow of about $12 million in Q1, with net cash from operations of approximately $26 million.\n\nHims & Hers is growing profitability, revenue, and cash while expanding into fast-growing segments of the healthcare industry. Investors might want to consider even a small position in the stock, which is already up around 130% since the start of 2024.\n\n2. Cava Group\n\nCava Group(NYSE: CAVA) is a fast-casual restaurant chain focused on offering Mediterranean cuisine. The company was founded in 2006 in Washington, D.C., and today has 323 restaurant locations in 25 states.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Cava reported revenue of $256 million, up more than 30% from one year ago. Notably, it was Cava's fourth consecutive quarter of profitability and its first quarter to generate positive free cash flow. The company generated a net income of $14 million in Q1. Adjusted earnings totaled $33 million, a 94% increase from the same quarter in 2023. Cava delivered cash from operations of $38 million in the quarter, with free cash flow coming in at just shy of $5 million. Of Cava's revenue in the quarter, 37% was derived from digital orders.\n\nRestaurants are known to be a particularly low-margin business. The average restaurant profit margin can be as low as 3%. Cava delivered a restaurant-level profit margin of 25% in the first quarter.\n\nAccording to a report by Technavio, the fast casual market in the U.S. is on track to hit a valuation of $150 billion by 2028. That's a compound annual growth rate of about 12% from its valuation in 2023.\n\nRestaurant stocks aren't for every investor, but if this is an industry you're interested in, you want to look for businesses with strong financials, margins, and a competitive edge in their respective market.\n\nCava's focus on its niche of Mediterranean cuisine, measured approach to its restaurant expansion, and steady growth in profits as well as revenue are all green flags here. Investors with a risk appetite for growth stocks might find this looks like an intriguing addition to a long-term portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Hims & Hers Health right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Hims & Hers Health, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Hims & Hers Health wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Restaurant Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "It\u2019s a tale of two markets in the restaurant space right now.\n\nSome fast-casual chains, such as Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA), are soaring to new all-time highs. At the same time, other restaurant operators are seeing their shares careen to new multi-year lows.\n\nRestaurants are a competitive field, and not all of the beaten-down chains will see a significant recovery. That\u2019s especially true as inflation and a slowing economy are starting to strain consumers\u2019 wallets. However, these three restaurant stocks to buy near 52-week-lows are compelling values that are set to heat up in the coming months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPortillo\u2019s (PTLO) A picture of a delicious American hot dog\n\nSource: eunyoung / Shutterstock.com\n\nPortillo\u2019s (NASDAQ:PTLO) is a small restaurant chain that specializes in Chicago-style foods such as hot dogs, sausages, Italian beef sandwiches, and milkshakes.\n\nThe company went public with just 67 locations in nine states. Investors have reasonably questioned how well the company\u2019s distinct menu will work outside of its already established core markets, such as the Chicago area.\n\nHowever, Portillo\u2019s is pressing on with aggressive growth plans, adding locations in fast-growing states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona. If these new locations pay off for Portillo\u2019s, it\u2019d be a total game-changer, converting it from a regional outfit to a nationwide player. And while the company is fairly small, it is already reporting positive earnings per share.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Portillo\u2019s will ultimately play out. However, with the stock down nearly 50% over the past year, a value opportunity has appeared even as revenues continue to grow at a reasonable rate. Analysts also agree, with Portillo\u2019s being tabbed as a consensus strong buy pick in the restaurant space.\n\nDine Brands (DIN) din stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDine Brands (NYSE:DIN) is a holding company that operates several restaurant concepts, including Applebee\u2019s, IHOP, and Fuzzy\u2019s Taco Shop.\n\nThe company primarily operates via a franchising model, meaning that it collects a percentage of sales from its franchise store partners. This insulates Dine from economic volatility, as the underlying store operators, not the parent company, have the most exposure to near-term economic swings.\n\nDue to the sticking power of the Applebee\u2019s and IHOP brands, Dine has sailed through various economic and political shocks over the decades.\n\nThe company is in another down cycle, with DIN stock falling 35% over the past year. This comes as Dine estimates that revenues will be up about 1% this year. That\u2019s not great, especially in these inflationary times, but it\u2019s hardly a business meltdown either.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, leading peer Brinker\u2019s International (NYSE:EAT), which runs the Chili\u2019s chain, is up 97% over the past year. Brinker\u2019s itself is only set to grow revenues about 5% this year. Despite that minimal difference in top-line growth, EAT stock is now up to 18 times forward earnings, while DIN stock sells at just 6 times forward earnings. Dine Brands is a deep value at today\u2019s price.\n\nYum China (YUMC) the great wall of china\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nYum China (NYSE:YUMC) is the Chinese operator of Yum! Brands\u2019 (NYSE:YUM) restaurant chains. Specifically, Yum China runs KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell within China, along with owning and operating some domestic restaurant brands such as Little Sheep.\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably heard, the Chinese economy is in a slump. Leading Chinese technology and e-commerce companies have seen their share prices collapse over the past few years amid this prolonged economic slowdown.\n\nNot surprisingly, these headwinds have cast a long shadow on consumer-focused names such as Yum China. YUMC stock is down by half from its 2023 peak.\n\nThis seems like a classic case of guilt by association. While China\u2019s economy is undoubtedly struggling, Yum China\u2019s affordable restaurant brands are faring all right.\n\nThe company enjoyed record-high revenues of $11 billion in 2023, and analysts see that jumping to $11.7 billion this year. Meanwhile, earnings per share are expected to climb 9% this year and return to double-digit growth in 2025. Shares trade at just 15 times forward earnings. If Yum China can achieve these sorts of results during an economic slump, just imagine how well its sales figures will look once the Chinese economy recovers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Maximize Gains: Sell These 7 Overvalued Stocks Before They Slide",
        "content": "While it\u2019s unclear whether the current bull market has more runway, or is veering towards a correction, you may want to take action now and jettison overvalued stocks to sell from your portfolio. In fact, irrespective of whether the broad market surges, sinks or trades sideways from here over the next few months, individual overvalued stocks can still be at risk of experiencing severe price declines.\n\nStocks become overvalued, when the market extrapolates near-term trends, pricing in the expected long-term growth as a near certainty. These stocks can also often be known as being \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d stocks. They can stay \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d as long as the bullish narrative persists. But, each of them may be one bad earnings release away from experiencing a sharp price reversal.\n\nAlso, there are beaten down stocks that, despite becoming considerably cheaper, are still overvalued, as factors like industry headwinds and deteriorating fundamentals remain not yet fully priced-in. These types of stocks are at risk of further declines, as the market concedes that a particular situation has gone from bad to worse. Below are seven stocks that fit into either of these categories. Consider them overvalued stocks to sell, before it\u2019s too late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is an example of an overvalued stock that fits best in the latter category mentioned above. Shares in the aerospace giant have been hammered by the fallout from aircraft safety incidents, and the resultant delays in the company\u2019s post-Covid rebound in new aircraft delivery.\n\nAfter falling by nearly 30% year-to-date, you may at first assume that recent headwinds have become fully factored into the price of BA stock. However, it\u2019s not as if this year\u2019s problems have resulted in Boeing sinking down to a fire sale valuation. At current prices, BA trades for 34.9 times analyst consensus for 2025 earnings. If, in the coming quarters, it becomes more apparent that the Boeing comeback will be delayed, or will arrive more slowly than currently anticipated, an additional price decline may be in store.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Boeing\u2019s late-2010s 737 safety headwinds, including two fatal plane crashes, haven\u2019t fully gone away. Families of the victims are now pushing for the U.S. Department of Justice to fine Boeing nearly $25 billion. Even if the company ultimately isn\u2019t on the hook for such a figure, this could in the near-term also weigh on valuation.\n\nCava (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve called Cava (NYSE:CAVA) one of the overvalued stocks to sell. Back in April, I argued that shares in the Mediterranean restaurant chain were very overvalued, and on the verge of pulling back due to profit taking after the company\u2019s latest earnings release.\n\nAdmittedly, this failed to pan out. Instead of pulling back post-earnings, CAVA stock surged even higher, and just recent hit a new all-time high. Even so, while Cava has remained one of the hottest stocks out there, if you own it, at the very least you may want to take some risk off the table. At current prices, CAVA trades for 263.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThis valuation appears particularly rich, considering that sell-side forecasts only call for revenue and earnings growth next year of 20% and 25.7%, respectively. Wall Street\u2019s sell-side community has already started to ring the warning bells. Earlier this month, analysts at JP Morgan downgraded CAVA to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy,\u201d giving the stock a $77 per share price target, citing valuation concerns.\n\nCasella Waste Systems (CWST) An image of a magnifying glass zooming in on an Apple web page with a red, yellow, and green circle buttons, two arrow buttons, another button, and the \"Casella\" logo.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past decade, Casella Waste Systems (NASDAQ:CWST) has been scaling itself up towards the size of its larger competitors in the waste management industry, such as Waste Management (NYSE:WM) and Republic Services (NYSE:RSG).\n\nThe resultant compounding in earnings growth has of course been a boon for long-term CWST stock investors. Shares are up nearly 20-fold since 2014. Yet after this incredible run, Casella may not be top of the heap for much longer. At current prices, shares sell for a staggering 126.6 times forward earnings. This represents a massive valuation premium to WM and RSG, which trade at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of 28.5 and 31.7, respectively.\n\nYes, Casella continues to buy up competitors and wring out cost efficiencies. As a result, CWST is expected to continue reporting high levels of per-share earnings growth. Current consensus calls for earnings per share to rise by 56.4% next year. Still, with expectations set so high, falling even slightly short of them could drive a big correction for the stock. On a longer time frame, CWST\u2019s valuation could normalize, meaning that while earnings growth continues, shares underperform, as fundamentals catch up with valuation.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) has fallen considerably since 2021, when vehicle electrification stocks peaked in popularity. Once trading for prices above $60 per share, today shares in this China EV maker trade for around $4.30 per share.\n\nBut while NIO stock has fallen into penny stock territory, make no mistake. This remains one of the overvalued stocks to sell. The company sports a nearly $9 billion valuation, despite continued heavy losses, as well as continued issues with getting back into high-growth mode. Although the company\u2019s latest monthly delivery numbers may suggest that it\u2019s heading back into the growth fast lane, Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff begs to differ.\n\nAs Navllier recently argued, Nio\u2019s hyping up its potential to experience a growth resurgence. Why? High competition in the Chinese EV market calls it into question. Moreover, recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China could limit Nio\u2019s global expansion plans, including in Europe. In the quarters ahead, if operating performance fails to dramatically improve, and further cash burn leads to a growing likelihood for additional dilutive capital raises, expect a further correction for NIO.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nExcitement about the metaverse growth peaked in 2022. Since 2023, it\u2019s taken a backseat to excitement over the generative AI growth trend. Hence, it\u2019s not surprising that Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) shares have fallen by nearly 75% from their all-time closing high of $134.72 per share.\n\nThat said, even after this tremendous price decline, I wouldn\u2019t call the video game platform operator\u2019s shares a bargain. The company sports a valuation of around $23 billion. This comes despite Roblox continuing to be unprofitable. Yes, sales growth has continued to steadily climb. Losses have also narrowed. All of this may suggest that RBLX can at the very least grow into its valuation, but that\u2019s hardly a given. At least, based upon the guidance that accompanied RBLX\u2019s latest quarterly earnings release.\n\nThe latest outlook fell short of sell-side expectations. For this alone, shares fell by around 22% immediately after earnings back in May. A continued de-rating for Roblox may occur, if growth keeps slowing down, and subsequent guidance quells growth resurgence hopes. Barring renewed enthusiasm for metaverse stocks, be cautious. Sell or stay away from RBLX.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit logo displayed on a smartphone device. RDDT stock\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) is another name I\u2019ve pointed out as being one of the overvalued stocks to sell. Shares in the social media platform have experienced roller coaster price action, since debuting in the public markets in March.\n\nHowever, at current prices in the high-$50s per share, RDDT stock is overvalued compared to current fundamentals. Right now, investors are pricing into Reddit the possibility of the company capitalizing greatly on the gen AI boom. Namely, through a collaboration with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Also, while not certain, the latest wave of \u201cmeme mania\u201d in the stock market may be having a positive impact on the valuation of RDDT.\n\nHowever, \u201cmeme mania\u201d is heading into the sunset once again. It\u2019s very possible that AI-related upside was already priced into RDDT at the time of its IPO. Shares are already starting to pull back, so a return to the stock\u2019s 52-week low in the high-$30s may be just around the corner. Reddit\u2019s stock market subreddits may or may not be a great source for investing ideas, but RDDT is not a great idea for profit-seeking investors right now.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW stock)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares have fallen by nearly 50% since March. Following this big price decline, you may think that this cloud data stock has finally fallen to a reasonable price. However, even after such a massive haircut, SNOW continues to sport a triple-digit multiple.\n\nThat is, at current prices, SNOW trades for 200.5 times forward earnings. Investors are nowhere near as hyped-up about Snowflake\u2019s AI potential as they were just before the disappointing guidance update that triggered its avalanche of a price decline, but some may be holding hope \u201cbetter than feared\u201d results are just around the corner. It\u2019s perfectly fine to make this wager. After all, Snowflake recently provided some upbeat guidance for the current quarter.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that downside risk still runs high. If Snowflake\u2019s launch of new AI products fails to shore up its growth, another massive de-rating could take shape. At such a high forward multiple, the stock could experience another 50%, 60%, maybe even a 70% price decline, and still be in overvalued territory. With far less pricey ways to play the AI growth trend out there, don\u2019t waste your time or risk your capital with SNOW.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chipotle and Cava Are Market Darlings. These 2 Other Differentiated Restaurant Chains Could Follow Similar Paths.",
        "content": "Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) and Mediterranean concept Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) are undeniably stock market darlings in the restaurant industry. Over the past year, Chipotle's shares are up 70%, and Cava's are up by a whopping 150%. Investors are simply enthused with what they see.\n\nThere's good reason for that enthusiasm. Their businesses are both doing remarkably well, and investors can measure the success from multiple angles.\n\nIt's hard to earn hefty profits in the restaurant space, but this duo does it better than most. At the restaurant level, Chipotle had an operating margin of almost 28% in the first quarter of 2024, and Cava's margin was 25%.\n\nMoreover, both are consistently growing in popularity, as measured by same-store sales (comps) growth. In the first quarter, Chipotle's comps grew 7%, and Cava's grew 2%, continuing the long-term trends for both businesses.\n\nChipotle and Cava are also somewhat differentiated in the restaurant space -- burritos and falafel aren't your typical burgers and fries. And perhaps this differentiation has helped these chains open up new locations at rapid paces. In 2023 alone, Chipotle opened 271 new locations, and Cava opened 72.\n\nHowever, if there's any legitimate argument against buying these two stocks now, it's that they trade at expensive valuations. Both are at all-time-high price-to-sales (P/S) ratios -- 9 for Chipotle and 13 for Cava, both of which are quite lofty for restaurant stocks. CMG PS Ratio Chart\n\nIf you appreciate the growth and profits that those two companies deliver, but wish you could invest in them at more attractive valuations, then you should take a look at Kura Sushi(NASDAQ: KRUS) and Gen Restaurant Group(NASDAQ: GENK). These restaurant chains share the attractive qualities of Chipotle and Cava but are far more reasonably priced today.\n\n1. Kura Sushi\n\nThere are over 500 Kura Sushi locations in Japan owned by its parent company, making it one of the largest sushi chains in that country. But in the U.S., Kura Sushi is quite small, with only 59 locations as of Feb. 29 (the end of its fiscal 2024 second quarter). However, it plans to open 13 to 14 new U.S. locations this year, and management has set a goal of 400 locations over the long term. Relative to its size today, those are huge plans.\n\nKura Sushi uses tech such as food-carrying conveyor belts, robots that bring diners their drinks, and toy-dispensing machines at the tables. Management calls this model \"eater-tainment,\" and believes this draws people to discover the brand. It seems to be working considering that fiscal Q2 comps grew by 3%, and fiscal 2023 comps grew by almost 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its fiscal 2023, Kura Sushi's locations did nearly $4.3 million in sales volume on average -- higher than either Chipotle or Cava. And thanks to this high sales volume, its restaurant-level operating profit margin was 20% as of the second quarter.\n\nTherefore, it seems like Kura Sushi is growing in popularity, has good restaurant financials, and has enough differentiation to stand out and grow substantially. And trading at a P/S ratio of 4.5, its valuation is half that of Chipotle and far cheaper than Cava.\n\n2. Gen Restaurant Group\n\nIf Kura Sushi is small at 59 locations, then Gen Restaurant Group is really small -- its Gen Korean BBQ chain has only 40 locations. But again, this California-based company believes it can quickly expand. It expects to open at least eight locations this year, at least 10 next year, and around 15 in 2026.\n\nIn other words, the chain expects to nearly double in size over the next three years. And it thinks it can have more than 250 locations long term.\n\nWith Korean barbecue, diners cook their food themselves at the table. Gen Korean BBQ offers unlimited food at set prices, which can contribute to guest satisfaction.\n\nAnother interesting thing about this company is that it designs and installs its own ventilation systems for its tabletop grills. This keeps costs lower and increases the speed at which it can grow: It's not waiting on specialized third-party providers to build out a restaurant.\n\nGen Korean BBQ's first-quarter comps were down almost 2%, but I don't believe this is reason for concern. The restaurants do close to $6 million in annual sales volume on average, which is really high. There are natural limits on how a location's high sales volume can be, and since sales are so high already, it's logical for comps to look weak even though its restaurants are still packed full of diners.\n\nBut Gen Korean BBQ might be able to boost its sales volume a little more. The company just launched a new premium menu that includes items such as Wagyu beef at a higher price point. Perhaps some of its customers might be enticed to pay more for the higher quality.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive feat for a company this small is that Gen Korean BBQ is already profitable. Investors can expect profits to ebb and flow at this stage of its business, but in 2023, the company had $11 million in net income for a profit margin that was greater than 6% -- and that's before making any helpful accounting adjustments.\n\nIncluding both classes of Gen Restaurant Group stock, it has a market capitalization of just over $300 million. This means that it trades at less than 2 times sales -- even cheaper than Kura Sushi.\n\nThe stocks of Gen Restaurant Group and Kura Sushi both have cheaper valuations than Chipotle or Cava. But they share many of the same attractive traits that allowed those better-known chains to grow, and have strong upside potential. That combination of qualities might make the sushi chain and the Korean BBQ concept better buys right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Kura Sushi Usa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Kura Sushi Usa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Kura Sushi Usa wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Restaurant Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Apart from the great Chipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG), one of the most remarkable and resilient high-growth restaurant stocks on the market in recent years, the fast food, fast casual, and quick-serve restaurant scene hasn\u2019t been too hot lately.\n\nNot all chains have been able to keep thriving amid inflation, especially those known for offering some of the most competitive prices in the industry. Despite the higher costs of living, people still seem willing to pay more if they\u2019re getting food that\u2019s perceived as made with higher-quality, potentially healthier ingredients.\n\nAt this inflation winddown phase, I think quality could become more important than affordability. Of course, price sensitivity also remains vital, given intense industry competition and consumer cravings for a good deal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll examine three restaurant stocks rated as buys by many analysts that may be worth considering in late June.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has continued to set the new growth standard for the restaurant industry. With the stock soaring close to 60% in the past year and over 158% in the last two years, many are likely wondering just how much this nearly parabolic recent rally has to go.\n\nThough getting on the expensive side, I still view Chipotle as having the legs to climb past $3,500 per share. Many analysts feel the same way as the high-growth restaurant chain approaches its much-awaited and much-needed stock split.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs view Chipotle as a \u201cleader in offering value and quality to customers,\u201d which is quite remarkable given \u201cconsumer behavior changes\u201d hitting the industry. I couldn\u2019t agree more. Undoubtedly, Chipotle has a not-so-secret formula for growth, and until now, few other firms have been able to follow the same playbook.\n\nShould rivals catch up with consumer trends by offering higher-quality food for an incrementally higher price, perhaps CMG stock\u2019s momentum could slow. Until then, I find little reason to throw in the towel.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s a firm that seems to be taking a page out of Chipotle\u2019s playbook, it\u2019s Cava (NYSE:CAVA), a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant that\u2019s growing quite rapidly. With a $10.25 billion market cap, there\u2019s plenty of room to run as the firm continues its expansion.\n\nIn many ways, Cava sounds like the little brother of a Chipotle. With delicious, healthy, and customizable Mediterranean meals, Cava is quickly becoming a household name for many. With more growth runway and no shortage of new menu items, Cava stands out as a restaurant high-flyer, which, like Chipotle, deserves a rich premium to the industry averages.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, at writing, the stock trades at more than 420 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), making it one of the most expensive restaurant stocks you\u2019ll likely come across this year.\n\nAt around eight times price-to-sales (P/S), CAVA stock looks somewhat more palatable, especially once the company shifts gears from sales growth to margin enhancement. That said, for now, Cava has its foot on the gas. It\u2019s a high double-digit grower fit for fans of the chain who aren\u2019t put off by volatility and the pie-in-the-sky multiple.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USA\n\nSource: Here Now / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), an upscale burger and frozen custard chain that\u2019s trying to show the world that consumers are more than willing to pay a little more to get a lot more quality. Though the value proposition is up for debate, I do find the company\u2019s expansion plan could help SHAK stock resume its rally after recently plunging more than 18% off its 52-week highs near $110 per share.\n\nThe first Shake Shack opened in Canada last week in the city of Toronto, and it won\u2019t be the last one. With many Torontonians eager to try the American chain for the very first time, it will be interesting to gauge just how lucrative a market Canada can be as Shake Shack looks to gradually increase its footprint north of the border.\n\nFor now, the firm\u2019s taking it somewhat slow with the expansion into the new market, with just 34 additional stores to open in the next decade, less than the new locations to open in the U.S. in 2024. For now, I view the slow and steady expansion as incredibly prudent. It\u2019s far better to wade your way into new waters than make too big of a splash early on with restaurant stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Tech stocks are leading the way, with valuation multiples going to ever-higher levels.\n\nThis week, we got news that inflation continues to moderate, which paves the way for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the near future. Not surprisingly, momentum traders bid up growth stocks to even higher prices on this development.\n\nAs it turns out, however, the real winner may be elsewhere. These three off the radar stocks trading under $15 have seen their share prices tumble over the past year. They could all be set for a major comeback \u2014 even tripling by 2026 if things go well \u2014 as more conducive macroeconomic policy takes hold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrafTech (EAF) Multiple pieces of graphite are stacked on top of each other.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGrafTech (NYSE:EAF)\u00a0develops, manufactures, and sells graphite and carbon-based solutions worldwide.\n\nMore specifically, it manufactures graphite electrodes that are used in electric arc furnace steel. While this may seem like a niche business, surprisingly enough, this Ohio-based firm has been in business since 1886.\n\nAs the steel market is heavily cyclical, GrafTech has seen its fortunes fade over the past year. A weakening auto market \u2014 plagued by higher interest rates \u2014 reduced demand for steel and related inputs such as GrafTech\u2019s graphite solutions.\n\nGrafTech\u2019s revenues are projected to fall another 15% this year on top of last year\u2019s large decline. The company is also significantly unprofitable at the moment.\n\nBut EAF stock more than reflects these concerns, with shares off 75% over the past year.

Restaurant.\n\nSource: Rido / Shutterstock\n\nDenny\u2019s (NASDAQ:DENN) is a classic American dining chain with more than 1,700 locations.\n\nLike many restaurant stocks, it has had a rough go of it since the pandemic. DENN stock was trading around $20 prior to the pandemic and shares go for less than $7 now. It did bounce back to $20 in 2021 amid optimism that restaurants would quickly recover to 2019 levels of business. But those gains have long since disappeared.\n\nThat comes as more traditional restaurant chains like Denny\u2019s haven\u2019t captured the same energy as newer entrants like Cava (NYSE:CAVA) or Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG).\n\nThat said, a change in economic conditions could give Denny\u2019s a boost. Restaurants like Cava have fared well during a period of carefree consumer spending. But $17 salads may give way to more hearty and cheaper fare such as what Denny\u2019s offers when economic conditions worsen.\n\nStory continues\n\nDENN stock has fallen 45% over the past year. This has pushed the stock down to less than 11 times forward earnings. With the company posting positive top- and bottom-line growth, this sets Denny\u2019s up for a major turnaround on any improvement in sentiment.\n\nPerion Networks (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion Networks (NASDAQ:PERI) is the quintessential example of a company that flew slightly too close to the sun. Shares jumped from $3 in 2019 to a peak of more than $40 per share last year. Since then, PERI stock has plunged 75% amid a slowdown in revenues and multiple weak earnings reports.\n\nThe company\u2019s digital advertising platform enjoyed explosive growth during the early days of the pandemic, growing revenues from $261 million in 2019 to $743 million in 2023. However, revenues are projected to slide to just $500 million this year, largely driven by changes with a key customer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Specifically, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine removed several advertising providers, including Perion, from its platform.\n\nThis represents a major intermediate-term hit to Perion\u2019s outlook. However, the company remains significantly profitable on an EBITDA-adjusted basis. Perion has already proven that its advertising technology can deliver rapid growth with the right partners. And its AI-driven ad solutions business could spark both customer and investor interest.\n\nThe Microsoft strategic changes certainly have hit Perion hard. But with the stock down from $40 to $8, it\u2019s not hard to imagine sentiment swinging back in the upward direction and shares tripling back to $25 or so once top- and bottom-line growth return.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that there are not many restaurant stocks to buy currently available. Consumers are reigning in their spending and reducing the amount they spend. It took a while for the U.S. Federal Reserve to catch up to the trends. However, interest rate increases and ongoing inflationary problems have finally started to bring an end to excess consumer discretionary spending.\n\nEven the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain, McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), is feeling the squeeze. Starting later this month, it plans on offering a $5 meal deal to bring back customers. But, as the promotion is only a month long, it remains to be seen if that will change the tide of its currently mixed financial results.\n\nThis all leaves investors wondering what the best restaurant stocks to buy right now are. There certainly are good buys out there, but it will depend greatly on how each restaurant company will navigate the near future while also planning for the long-term. Taking that into account, here are three of the best restaurant stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSweetgreen (SG) indoor vertical farming set up with green plants on shelves and PVC irrigation tubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YEINISM\n\nSweetgreen (NYSE:SG) is a fast casual salad restaurant chain founded in the Washington, D.C. area in 2007. It went public in November 2021, right around the time the stock market as a whole took a major dip. So it\u2019s not surprising that in the first six months of being publicly traded it lost almost 83% of its value.\n\nBut the company is up a staggering 205% year-to-date (YTD), thanks in part to it beating all major expectations for its first quarter results. Sweetgreen opened six new restaurants during the first quarter. And, same-store sales increased 5%, 2% higher than management expected. Revenue totaled $158 million, which was better than management\u2019s expectation of $154 million at best.\n\nSweetgreen is growing in popularity and plans to open up to 28 new stores in 2024, including nine automated restaurants. The company has also been very strategic as it opens new locations. It prefers to place them in areas with a large population, in high employment areas and in high income areas. As a relatively new name in the restaurant industry, there is plenty of opportunity for growth. SG appears to be one of the great restaurant stocks to buy right now.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) seems to be weathering a recent controversy mostly unharmed. The CEO, Brian Niccol, has been lambasted online for his tone deaf response to customers\u2019 complaints about portion sizes. However, CMG stock is up 41% on the year, and has remained relatively flat in the days since his video blunder went viral.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of this month, Chipotle is set to complete a 50-for-1 stock split in order to make its shares more affordable. This split will be one of the largest ever for the New York Stock Exchange and presents great potential for investors who can buy in now. However, it also implies good future upside for investors who need to wait until it becomes more affordable. With this development, CMG might be at the top of the list of best restaurant stocks to buy this month.\n\nOther recent positive financial developments for the company in Q1 include total revenue increasing by 14.1% to $2.7 billion. Additionally, comparable restaurant sales increased\u00a0 7% and diluted earnings per share came in at $13.01, a 23.9% year-over-year increase.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWashington D.C. area restaurant founders must be on to something, because Cava (NYSE:CAVA) is another one of the top restaurant stocks to buy right now. Relatively new to the stock market having only gone public in June of 2023, Cava is up 137% since its IPO and 121% YTD.\n\nWhat some would consider the Mediterranean version of Chipotle, Cava offers bowls, salads and pita wraps. It targets a similar demographic as Sweetgreen and Chipotle, so it\u2019s no surprise it is also doing well in the current economy. While traffic has slowed, the company still recently reported great Q1 results. EPS came in at 12 cents, a dramatic improvement from a loss of $1.30 per share the year prior, and beating analysts\u2019 estimates of 5 cents. Revenue was up 30.3% to $256.3 million and beat Wall Street forecasts of $246 million.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Cava now expects to open 50 to 54 net new restaurants in 2024, up from its February outlook of 48 to 52 net openings. With that increase has come the expectation that same-restaurant sales and adjusted EBITDA will also be higher than previously estimated. As consumers look for more affordable options, restaurants like Cava that offer filling meals for reasonable prices should see significant growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Of all the hot IPOs over the past year \u2014 AI firms and biotech startups and the like \u2014 none has popped on Wall Street quite like Cava Group Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Tesla Investors Back Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Deal, Texas Move Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. Tech Powers Stocks as Adobe Surges in Late Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nThe restaurant chain \u2014 the Mediterranean Chipotle, as its financial backers like to call it \u2014 has soared more than 300% since its initial public offering in June 2023, giving it a market valuation of over $10 billion. That equates to $33 million for each of its 323 restaurants, a staggering sum even for a chain that\u2019s rapidly expanding. By comparison, investors valued Chipotle Mexican Grill, the benchmark in the US fast-casual restaurant industry, at just about $3 million per restaurant when it completed the one-year mark in public markets. (On a price-to-earnings ratio, Cava is expensive, too, clocking in at 185.)\n\nAll of this highlights how the global IPO market is cracking back open after a couple of sluggish years. Bring the right kinds of new stocks to market, like a trendy fast-casual chain, and investors will bid them up.\n\nBut the rally has been so extreme that it\u2019s starting to cause angst among some Cava bulls. In the span of just four days, two of the 15 Wall Street analysts who cover the company \u2014 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s John Ivankoe and Piper Sandler\u2019s Brian Mullan \u2014 cut the stock to neutral from overweight.\n\nThe per-restaurant valuation \u201cis unprecedented\u201d in the industry, Ivankoe wrote in his June 3 report. Each location, he noted, currently pulls in less than $3 million a year on average in revenue. He told clients he\u2019d rather buy Chipotle stock at this point, underscoring a broader trend: two-thirds of analysts have buy ratings on Chipotle versus just over half now for Cava.\n\nSome corporate insiders have also recently sold chunks of their Cava stock. For the most part, though, investors remain willing to accept such lofty valuations. Even after a sluggish start to June, Cava is up more than 100% this year. Fast casual is popular with the Wall Street set now, and Cava, as they see it, is the up-and-comer that will trace Chipotle\u2019s arc.\n\n\u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for these growth-oriented concepts,\u201d said Jim Salera, an analyst who covers restaurant stocks at Stephens. Salera, who doesn\u2019t have a rating on Cava, says they\u2019ll \u201cpay that premium because there\u2019s only a handful of restaurants that are providing growth.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Lauren Balik, the CEO and founder of research firm Upright Analytics, the whole Cava-is-the-next Chipotle narrative is complicated. Yes, she says, Cava could expand rapidly like Chipotle did \u2014 the company plans to have 1,000 restaurants in operation within a decade \u2014 and business could boom, but that growth brings its own risks. Chipotle struggled to standardize hygienic conditions as it quickly added restaurants, triggering a series of food-poisoning incidents that made national news and cratered the stock in 2015. It took Chipotle a while to fix its procedures, and the stock only began to rebound two years later.\n\nCava has managed to avoid such problems, opening more than 50 locations in the past year without any notable quality issues. Still, Balik says, it\u2019s a good reminder that rapid growth can cause operational hiccups. She\u2019s betting against the stock, having put on a short trade in January.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes the comparison to Chipotle. If you make that comparison, you have to compare Cava to early Chipotle, which was a similar story,\u201d Balik says. \u201cIt opened a lot of new stores, it grew quickly, but the operations and execution in late 2015 didn\u2019t work that well.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cava (CAVA) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know",
        "content": "Cava Group (CAVA) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cava basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Cava, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Cava\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2024, this Mediterranean restaurant chain is expected to earn $0.34 per share, which is a change of 61.9% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cava. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 47.2%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Cava to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This week I'm feeling a little bit hungry so we have two food related names to review.\n\nCava Group CAVA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is a Mediterranean fast casual restaurant chain that has seen a great run over the last few months. The company has been posting some good results and has been expanding margins of late even as food prices have continued to move higher.\n\nIn the video, we review the earnings history, earnings estimate revisions, growth projections and valuation. The idea with CAVA is that there is a very high valuation and the question becomes can they keep expanding margins. If they do, the current valuation can be supported but a turnaround in the area could mean big trouble.\n\nVital Farms VITL is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports the growth divergence that I love to see. When there is a strong Zacks Style Score for Growth and a weak Zacks Style Score for Value, I know I am on the right path.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Cava (CAVA): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CAVA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs CAVA Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Cava, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 38.7% over the past month to $0.34.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Cava. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Cava may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Time to Buy Cava Group's (CAVA) Stock for More Upside After Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "After posting impressive Q1 results last week, Cava Group CAVA has started to display the expansion that pushed other popular retail restaurant chains to notoriety among investors such as Chipotle Mexican Grill\u00a0CMG and Starbucks SBUX.\n\nTo that point, since going public in June of 2023, the Mediterranean fast-casual food chain has seen its stock soar almost +100% which in this time frame has largely outperformed Starbucks -19% and the Zacks Retail-Restaurant Market\u2019s -6% while impressively topping the broader indexes and even edging Chipotle\u2019s +56%.\n\nConsidering Cava Group has been one the hottest IPOs in recent memory let\u2019s see if it's still time to buy CAVA for more upside. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ1 Review\n\nPosting Q1 sales of $259.01 million, Cava Group\u2019s top line expanded 46% over the last three months with Q4 sales at $177.17 million. This also beat Q1 sales estimates of $246.65 million by 5%. More intriguing is that Cava Group is already profitable with Q1 EPS of $0.12 crushing expectations of $0.04 per share by 200% while skyrocketing from $0.02 a share in Q4. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectory & Overview\n\nAlthough Cava Group launched its IPO last year, the company was founded in 2006 and has locations across the United States. Fueling Cava Group\u2019s expansion is a unique dining experience with its build-your-own bowl model being similar to Chipotle as customers can customize their choice of high-quality fresh ingredients.\n\nCava Group\u2019s total sales are now expected to climb 24% in FY24 and are slated to jump another 20% in FY25 to just over $1 billion. Annual earnings are projected to soar 62% this year to $0.34 per share versus $0.21 a share in 2023. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to expand another 33% to $0.46. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMore intriguing and suggestive that the rally in CAVA could continue is that earnings estimate revisions for FY24 and FY25 are nicely up in the last 30 days and have now soared over 40% in the last two months respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCava Group's stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as it would be no surprise if CAVA continued to move higher considering the company\u2019s attractive growth trajectory and the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Don't Look Now, but Cava Is Worth 10 Cracker Barrels. Time to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "For over 50 years, restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store(NASDAQ: CBRL) has been pleasing customers with Southern style comfort food, old-timey products in its country store, and unique antique decor throughout its locations. Weary interstate travelers stop in, relax in some front-porch rocking chairs, and perhaps even play a game of checkers.\n\nThis nostalgic recipe has propelled Cracker Barrel into a well-known chain of 660 locations. But unfortunately for investors, it's worth just a small fraction of some younger, thriving restaurant chains.\n\nThe Mediterranean-themed restaurant chain Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) is a good example. As of April 21, Cava had only 323 locations -- about half the footprint of Cracker Barrel.\n\nMoreover, Cava was only just founded in 2010. In other words, Cracker Barrel had a head start of four decades to create shareholder value. But Cava is already out in front by a country mile.\n\nFor evidence, we can compare the market capitalizations of both restaurant chains -- the value of the companies based on current stock market prices. Cava's market capitalization is up over $10 billion, whereas Cracker Barrel's has sunk down to a measly $1 billion. Therefore, Cava is worth 10 Cracker Barrels, in a manner of speaking. CAVA Market Cap Chart\n\nHere are some thoughts on the valuation disparity between Cracker Barrel and Cava. And, more importantly, here are some thoughts on what to do about it.\n\nWhy is Cava worth so much more?\n\nUp front, understand that these business models are the same: Cracker Barrel and Cava don't franchise their restaurants -- they're all company-owned. There is a small difference in how the two companies go about it: Cava leases the real estate for all of its locations, whereas Cracker Barrel owns the real estate for about half of its restaurants.\n\nThat's not the difference maker for these two companies. The biggest differentiator is the valuation for the stocks. Looking at it from a price-to-sales (P/S) valuation, Cava stock is about 37 times more expensive than Cracker Barrel stock. CAVA PS Ratio Chart\n\nWhy are investors willing to pay such a higher valuation for Cava? To put it simply, Cava is executing far better than Cracker Barrel.\n\nOne of the most glaring differences in operations has to do with labor expenses. Cracker Barrel has already reported financial results for the first three quarters of its fiscal 2024. During this time, 36% of the company's revenue went to pay its workers. By comparison, Cava spent just under 26% of its revenue on labor -- that's a huge difference.\n\nThis is just one example of Cava's superior operations. As a result, the company's restaurant-level profit margins are around 25%. Cracker Barrel has an overall operating margin of less than 3%, which is down significantly from its margin of over 10% in 2017 -- it's been a steady, multi-year decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, investors are willing to pay up for Cava stock because it's much higher growth. Not only are same-store sales increasing at a nice pace, but management is also opening up new locations -- 14 in the most recent quarter alone.\n\nShould investors buy the cheaper stock?\n\nBuying cheap stocks is a relentless temptation for some of us. It feels safer. After all, if something is already cheap, it doesn't seem reasonable that it would get even cheaper.\n\nMoreover, the upside always seems compelling. Take Cracker Barrel for example: As shown above, it trades at a P/S multiple of 0.3. The stock could triple in value and still have a reasonable price tag.\n\nHowever, investors should ask why Cracker Barrel stock could suddenly get a better valuation. In my opinion, the business would first need to tangibly improve for this to happen. Then investors might bid the valuation higher out of excitement.\n\nIn short, those who buy a cheap Cracker Barrel stock are betting on a turnaround -- and in fairness, the company has ideas. For example, CEO Julie Masino recently pointed out that it's cutting certain menu items and eliminating unnecessary labor-intensive food preparation processes. That could help.\n\nBut in my investing career, I've observed more failed turnarounds than I could shake a stick at. Cracker Barrel doesn't have a straightforward path, and it will likely take time.\n\nBy contrast, companies with strong execution are usually hard to derail. I'd be hesitant to buy Cava stock today at its rich P/S of 12 -- I've rarely seen a restaurant stock so expensive. That said, the company has some of the strongest financials that I've seen in the space, and I'd be willing to bet that these stay strong for the long haul.\n\nI'm not necessarily saying that valuation doesn't matter or to run out to buy Cava stock today. But counterintuitively, it can be safer to buy an expensive stock with a strong business, rather than buying a cheap stock in hopes of a turnaround. Over long time horizons, poor businesses keep eroding shareholder value, while strong businesses create it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Growth Stock Goliaths: 7 Picks That Will Tower Over the Competition",
        "content": "Growth stocks continue to drive the market and investor portfolios higher. Several companies with strong catalysts are seeing their sales and profits rise, and that is pushing their share prices to new heights. For investors, growth stocks can make a big difference to the performance of their portfolio and how much money they ultimately make off their investments.\n\nCurrently, the stock market is hovering near all-time highs largely because of some strong performing growth stocks. These are stocks that have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin. And the companies behind them continue to flourish and expand at a rapid rate. Owning even a few of these high-flying growth equities can make all the difference when it comes to achieving wealth.\n\nLet\u2019s explore growth stock goliaths \u2014 seven picks that will tower over the competition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of audio streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) continues to rip higher. So far this year, SPOT has gained 70%, bringing its 12 month increase to 105%.\n\nThe company has distinguished itself as the dominant player in the streaming of music, podcasts and audiobooks. And, Spotify is giving satellite radio a run for its money. The latest news to drive the share price higher is that Spotify is raising the prices it charges for its premium plans in the U.S. as it tries to expand profit margins.\n\nAdditionally, the Swedish company has raised prices for its monthly individual premium plan to $11.99 from $10.99. Spotify has also increased the price of its premium duo plan to $16.99 from $14.99 and hiked its family plan to $19.99 from $16.99 previously. The price increases are the latest attempt by SPOT to improve margins. The company had already lowered its spending and cut staff. Spotify\u2019s quarterly profit topped $1 billion for the first time this April after the company curtailed its global marketing spend.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCan anything stop Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF)?\n\nRecently, the clothing retailer\u2019s stock jumped 24% higher after it reported record Q1 financial results. The company reported EPS of $2.14 versus $1.74 that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $1.02 billion compared to $963.3 million that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 22% from last year and profits were nearly seven times higher than Q1 of 2023.\n\nFurther, Abercrombie & Fitch said the results represented the strongest first quarter in its 132-year history. The company has been one of the best-performing retailers coming out of the pandemic. Specifically, it reported double-digit sales growth throughout 2023. Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s financial results have improved over the past six years when the company began to transform into a brand geared toward working millennials.\n\nStory continues\n\nANF stock has risen 440% in the past 12 months, including a 90% gain this year.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock market is near an all-time high. Trading in cryptocurrencies has come storming back. And, even the trade in meme stocks is back on.\n\nIs it any wonder that the stock of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) has more than doubled in the last 12 months (up 135%)? Shortly after reporting record Q1 financial results, HOOD announced its first ever stock buyback, sending its share price even higher.\n\nThe brokerage says it plans to repurchase $1 billion of its own shares over the next three years. Analysts at Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) have calculated that Robinhood Markets is likely to buyback 49 million shares of its common stock, or 6% of its total shares outstanding. The share repurchases are scheduled to begin in this year\u2019s third quarter. Robinhood Markets hasn\u2019t set an expiration date for its inaugural stock buyback program.\n\nTherefore, some analysts say the stock buyback is a sign that Robinhood is maturing. Also, the company has announced an expansion into credit cards. So far in 2024, HOOD stock is up 70%.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) went public a year ago. Since then, it has delivered four consecutive quarters of profits. The company, which many analysts refer to as the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), recently reported first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates across the board and raised its forward guidance.\n\nThe company reported EPS of 13 cents, which was nearly triple the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year ago. Cava continues to expand at breakneck speed, opening 14 new restaurants during Q1 of this year. That brought its national count to 323 outlets. And analysts say there\u2019s plenty more growth ahead.\n\nThe stock of Cava has more than doubled (up 133%) since its market debut in June 2023.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRene Haas, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of British microchip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), recently said that his goal is to capture 50% of the market for personal computer (PC) chips within five years. That\u2019s ambitious and speaks to Arm\u2019s ascent as a leading growth stock. Since holding its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2023, ARM stock has also more than doubled, having gained 108%.\n\nThe company has only reported a couple of quarterly earnings so far, but the results have been encouraging. Recently, Arm revealed that its fiscal Q4 revenue rose 47% year-over-year (YOY) to $928 million. The sales growth was driven by Arm\u2019s licensing unit, which grew 60% to $414 million during the quarter. The company said demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is powering its overall sales growth.\n\nArm\u2019s microchips and processors are already used in many different electronic devices, including most smartphones. The PC market looks to be the company\u2019s next target.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTalk about a comeback.\n\nAfter being decimated during the 2022 bear market, shares of Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) have come roaring back. The stock recently rose more than 30% after the online used car retailer reported record quarterly financial results and turned a profit during this year\u2019s first quarter. Year-to-date (YTD), Carvana\u2019s stock is up 104%. Over the past 12 months, the stock has risen an incredible 565%.\n\nFor Q1 of this year, the company announced EPS of 23 cents compared to a loss of 74 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $3.06 billion versus $2.67 billion that was anticipated on Wall Street. The financial results are records for Carvana, which has been in business since 2012. The strong print was attributed to efficiency gains in its operations and the reconditioning of vehicles for sale.\n\nManagement said they\u2019re planning further cost reductions and efficiency gains that will increase profitability further through areas such as advertising, overhead, and operational expenses. Carvana\u2019s success comes after a major restructuring, with the company pivoting to focus on profitability rather than growth after bankruptcy concerns emerged in 2022.\n\nEli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has a blockbuster catalyst with its hugely popular weight loss drug Zepbound. The medication used to treat obesity was only approved for sale in the U.S. six months ago.\n\nBut already, it is having a positive impact on LLY\u2019s finances. Recently, the pharmaceutical company reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit and raised its forward guidance as sales of its weight-loss drugs rapidly accelerate.\n\nEli Lilly and Co. reported Q1 EPS of $2.58 versus $2.46 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter missed analyst targets, coming in at $8.77 billion compared to $8.92 billion that was forecast. Despite the miss, sales were up 26% YOY. As for guidance, Eli Lilly and Co. said it expects full-year earnings of $13.50 to $14 per share, up from previous guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 a share. The company expects full-year revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion, which is an increase of $2 billion at either end of the range.\n\nAnalysts had expected full-year earnings of $12.50 a share and sales of $41.44 billion from Eli Lilly and Co. The latest earnings include the first full quarter of Zepbound sales. The drug, which was approved by U.S. regulators last autumn, reported $517.4 million in Q1 sales. Some analysts have forecast that Zepbound could post more than $1 billion of sales in its first year on the market. Therefore, it might become the biggest selling drug of all time.\n\nLLY stock has risen 87% over the last 12 months, including a YTD gain of 40%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in LLY and CAVA.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Cava Group Stock?",
        "content": "Cava Group's (NYSE: CAVA) stock price has more than doubled since the beginning of the year. The fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain is expanding rapidly and building a customer base eager for new healthy fast-food choices.\n\nStill, such concepts do not necessarily translate into lucrative stock picks, and for every Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), you can find numerous other restaurant stocks that have struggled to move higher over time. Fortunately for Cava shareholders, the business has made significant gains. The question for investors still on the sidelines is whether they have waited too long to buy the restaurant stock.\n\nThe state of Cava Group stock\n\nPart of the appeal of Cava Group is that many perceive it as a sort of second-chance stock for those who missed out on the approximately 140-fold gain in Chipotle delivered from its 2006 initial public offering (IPO) price to its current level.\n\nOn the surface, such a comparison makes sense. Both are fast-casual restaurants that emphasize food made with healthy ingredients. Also, since Cava specializes in Mediterranean cuisine, it does not compete with the Mexican food offered by Chipotle.\n\nMoreover, Cava operated 323 restaurants as of April 21 -- the end of its fiscal first quarter -- making it less than one-tenth the size of Chipotle and its approximately 3,500 locations. Achieving higher-percentage growth is easier from a smaller base, a factor that would presumably favor Cava.\n\nHowever, Cava could face more limitations than Chipotle. For one, Cava has stated a long-term goal of having 1,000 restaurants by 2032. While Cava could increase that target later, Chipotle management says it expects to eventually have 7,000 locations in North America, meaning it plans to grow more than Cava.\n\nCava could also struggle to attract more customers as quickly as it hopes. Despite the recent growth in the popularity of Mediterranean food, interest in it lags well behind Mexican food, another indication that Cava's growth potential might not match Chipotle's.\n\nImproving financials\n\nResults have justifiably stoked investor optimism for Cava. Its $259 million in fiscal first-quarter revenue was a 30% yearly increase. That's not as strong as its 60% surge in fiscal 2023, but it's still a rapid rise. Since same-restaurant sales climbed 2% yearly, most of the growth came from the 60 new restaurants the company opened during the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe company limited its operating expense growth to 22%, resulting in an operating profit. With that, net income for the fiscal first quarter was $14 million, improving from a $2 million loss in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough management did not offer revenue guidance, it said it expects to open between 50 and 54 restaurants over the next year, which should help it maintain a rapid growth pace.\n\nStill, with the aforementioned share price increase, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has spiked to 13, well above Chipotle's ratio of 8. This is concerning given the challenging competitive landscape faced by Cava. Since Chipotle is a more developed chain offering a more popular cuisine, prospective investors may question whether Cava's stock is worth its premium price.\n\nWhere is Cava stock headed?\n\nAmid the continuing growth and rising valuations, the answer to the question of whether this is too late or too early to buy Cava stock depends on investors' point of view.\n\nThose who are not shareholders already might be too late to capitalize on the recent surge in the price. Those prospective buyers would have to pay a significantly higher valuation for the enterprise.\n\nHowever, management seems to have built a successful restaurant chain. Given its growth and rising popularity, it holds the potential to rise much higher over the long term, meaning investors still could be able to profitably buy into this company at this relatively early stage.\n\nInvestors who choose to buy now should probably accumulate their stakes gradually since the stock looks increasingly unpredictable in the near term. Still, Cava Group's rapid expansion plans appear to pave the way for rising revenue and profits over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Move Over, Chipotle -- Cava Sees Revenue Surge. Time to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "In the restaurant space, investors are constantly on the lookout for what company could become the next Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). And for good reason -- Chipotle's stock is up over 7,000% since it IPO'd back in 2006.\n\nThe latest contender is Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), a Mediterranean restaurant fast-casual concept that has been growing its restaurant base quickly. The company reported strong revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nLet's take a close look at Cava's most recent earnings report and see whether the stock makes good sense for investors now.\n\nA surge in revenue\n\nCava saw revenue for its fiscal Q1, which ended April 21, soar 30% to $256.3 million. The growth was aided by the company having 323 locations at period end versus 263 at the end of its fiscal Q1 a year ago. Same restaurant sales grew 2.3%, although the company said that adjusting for holiday shifts, it would have seen 4.3% growth. Cava saw a 3.5% benefit from menu price increases and mix, while guest traffic was down -1.2%.\n\nNotably, the company was facing difficult comparisons, as a year ago it saw same restaurant sales growth of 28.4%. Its restaurant level margins (RLM) ticked down slightly to 25.2% from 25.4%. This metric helps measure the profitability of its restaurants before corporate costs. Food costs as a percentage of revenue went down, but labor costs rose.\n\nThe company flipped to a profit, with earnings per share of $0.12 versus a loss of $1.30 a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, nearly doubled to $33.3 million. Cava also generated $38.4 million in operating cash flow on the quarter and free cash flow of $4.7 million. This is important, as it shows the company can self-fund its restaurant expansion plans, which is one of the long-term key drivers for the stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAs a result of its solid start to the year, Cava also raised its full-year guidance. It now expects same restaurant sales growth to come in between 4.5% to 6.5%, from an earlier range of 3% to 5%, and for adjusted EBITDA of between $100 million to $105 million, up from a prior outlook of $86 million to $92 million. Cava also increased its expected restaurant openings for this fiscal year to between 50 to 54, up from an earlier view of 48 to 52 new locations.\n\nThe company said it does see a potential traffic headwind as the excitement that came with its IPO last year starts to fade. However, it is expecting the launch of a new grilled steak offering to help boost comps, given the favorable reception the dish has had in test markets in Boston and Dallas. Cava will also look to roll out a loyalty program by year-end, although its potential positive effect is not contemplated in its current guidance. The steak rollout will, however, be a slight headwind to its restaurant level margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, its expansion plans continue to remain on track, with locations now in 25 states and the District of Columbia. It said its recent entry into the Midwest with an opening in Chicago was met with strong results.\n\nTime to buy the stock?\n\nDespite a solid first quarter, Cava shares were falling following its latest report. One reason could be the stock's valuation which, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 230 times and a price-to-sales of 9.6 times, is not cheap. Even at an enterprise value to EBITDA basis, the stock trades at a hefty 87 multiple. Compared to other growing fast casual concepts such as Chipotle and Shake Shack, the stock is expensive. CAVA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, Cava has less than a tenth of the number of restaurants that Chipotle has in the U.S. currently. If the concept can remain popular and garner the same appeal throughout the U.S., Cava could potentially grow to become the size that Chipotle is today (nearly an $87 billion market cap) over the next 15 to 20 years. Note that Chipotle had under 500 locations in 20 states at the time of its IPO in 2006.\n\nThat would mean a lot of upside for Cava stock, which currently has about a $9 billion market capitalization. It's not easy projecting out a restaurant chain's success over the next two decades, as tastes do evolve. But the ingredients are in place for Cava to potentially be a huge winner despite its current expensive stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "CAVA Group, Inc. Just Beat EPS By 198%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "As you might know, CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) just kicked off its latest quarterly results with some very strong numbers. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$259m, some 5.5% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$0.12, 198% ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for CAVA Group  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing the latest results, CAVA Group's nine analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$897.9m in 2024. This would be a solid 14% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 33% to US$0.34. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$874.7m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.25 in 2024. So it seems there's been a definite increase in optimism about CAVA Group's future following the latest results, with a considerable lift to the earnings per share forecasts in particular.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for CAVA Group 27% to US$86.20on the back of these upgrades. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on CAVA Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$94.00 and the most bearish at US$72.00 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that CAVA Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 20% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 29% growth over the last year. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 9.8% per year. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that CAVA Group is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards CAVA Group following these results. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on CAVA Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

This presents an opportunity for shrewd investors to take advantage of before the stocks inevitably rise again.\n\nHere are three currently low-priced stocks poised for a breakout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors would be smart to buy the dip in Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) after the Mediterranean restaurant chain reported blowout first-quarter financial results that crushed Wall Street forecasts. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 12 cents, which was more than double the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $256.3 million, ahead of expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year ago. Cava opened 14 new restaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its national count to 323 outlets.\n\nDespite the strong print, CAVA stock fell 5% after the company said that its same-store sales increased only 2.3% from a year ago as consumers spend less on dining out. In the previous quarter, Cava\u2019s same-store sales grew 11% year-over-year (YOY). The pullback among consumers is likely to be temporary and doesn\u2019t take away from the company\u2019s long-term growth potential. Cava has now reported four consecutive quarters of profitability since going public in June 2023.\n\nThe company raised its forward guidance for the current year, saying it expects to add 50 to 54 new restaurant locations and see same-store sales growth between 4.5% and 6.5%. Cava is also forecasting full-year earnings of $100 million to $105 million. That\u2019s an increase from an earlier forecast of $86 million to $92 million. Since going public nearly a year ago, CAVA stock has risen 143%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) a red 18-wheeler truck driving down the highway\n\nSource: Vitpho/Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s been a big selloff in shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) since the trucking and logistics company reported its Q1 results. ODFL stock is currently down 13% on the year and 24% below its 52-week high. Here, too, should investors see a buying opportunity. Like Cava Group, Old Dominion Freight Line\u2019s print wasn\u2019t that bad and the share price is not likely to be down for long.\n\nThe company managed to report a slight Q1 beat on the top and bottom lines. Old Dominion Freight Line announced EPS of $1.34, which was a little ahead of consensus estimates of $1.33. Revenues of $1.46 billion were just below the $1.47 billion forecast on Wall Street. While the results were by no means a blowout, management\u2019s warning of a slowdown in shipments in coming months has hurt ODFL stock. Those concerns have been echoed by other U.S. trucking companies.\n\nAny slowdown in shipments is likely to be cyclical and short-lived. As such, investors with a long time horizon would be wise to buy ODFL stock while its down. Long-term, Old Dominion Freight Line has been a consistent winner for its shareholders, having risen more than 750% in the last decade. With that kind of track record, investors would be wise to buy in now as ODFL is clearly one of the low-priced breakout stocks to watch.\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) is another traditionally strong stock that has been brought down by its recent financial results. So far in 2024, LOW stock has fallen 1.3% compared to an 11% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Lowe\u2019s share price is up only 5% over the past 12 months. As with the other names on this list, Lowe\u2019s stock has been harmed by a predicted sales slowdown.\n\nFor Q1 of this year, Lowe\u2019s announced financial results that topped Wall Street forecasts despite consumers pulling back their spending on do-it-yourself projects and large household appliances. The company reported EPS of $3.06 compared to $2.94 that was expected among analysts. Revenue for the January through March quarter came in at $21.36 billion versus $21.13 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street.\n\nIn its earnings release, Lowe\u2019s said that sales to professional contractors helped to offset a decline in consumer spending during the first three months of the year. Management added that they expect a continued pullback in discretionary consumer spending over the near-term, sending the stock lower. However, Lowe\u2019s maintained its full-year guidance and sees a reversal in consumer spending later in 2024. LOW stock is up 130% over the past five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nChipotle has given its owners great returns over the past five years, with the stock up by nearly 360%. Investors are increasingly paying attention to another stock in the industry, Cava Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA), a much smaller chain.\n\nFocused on Mediterranean cuisine, Cava\u2019s stock has increased by 112% year to date. This momentum raises the question of whether Cava offers a unique investing opportunity.\n\nCava\u2019s Business Model and Rapid Growth\n\nLike Chipotle\u2019s, Cava\u2019s business concept lets patrons create salads, grain bowls, or pitas. Management credits growing public awareness of better dietary options as a driver of success, while Cava\u2019s fast-casual style improves accessibility and convenience for its customers.\n\nAmid inflation and economic uncertainty, Cava has shown great growth. Its sales increased by 59.8% in 2023, thanks to 72 new stores opening and 17.9% more sales at existing stores. Last year, the company made $729 million in sales, 518% more than the previous year.\n\nHigh-growth businesses often lose money, but Cava generated a net income of $13.3 million last year after losing $59 million the year before.\n\nThe chain reported 309 stores on Dec. 31, 2023, and the leadership team has ambitions to scale to 1,000 outlets throughout the United States by 2032.\n\nTrending:Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nHigh Expectations and Valuation Concerns for Cava\n\nInvestors hope that Cava can replicate Chipotle\u2019s long-term success. With 3,500 locations, Chipotle continues to expand rapidly, opening 271 new stores last year. Its strong revenue and earnings growth have made its shares attractive to investors.\n\nExpectations for Cava are high, with its stock trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 11.1, a 30 percent premium over Chipotle. However, this high valuation raises questions about its justification.\n\nCava\u2019s valuation suggests management will achieve its goal of opening 1,000 stores ahead of the 2032 target.\n\nThe company plans to open 50 net new sites in 2024, a decrease from the previous year.\n\nAlso, same-store sales are only expected to rise by 3% to 5%, which is very different from last year\u2019s growth of 10% or more. Chipotle expects similar sales growth in the mid-to-high-single-digit range this year, even though it is larger and has a greater percentage of the U.S. market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Real Opportunity In Today's Market\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "Year Over Year CAVA Revenue Growth of 30.3% Including CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 2.3%\n\n14 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings During Quarter\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 25.2%\n\nWASHINGTON, May 28, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE: CAVA) (\"CAVA Group\" or the \"Company\"), the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand that brings heart, health, and humanity to food, today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended April 21, 2024.\n\n\"CAVA\u2019s results in the first quarter demonstrate the strength of our category-defining brand, our clear leadership position in Mediterranean and our compelling differentiated value proposition,\" said Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO. \"Driven by our highly portable Mediterranean concept and powerful unit economic engine, we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of net income and our first quarter ever of positive free cash flow. During the quarter, Same Restaurant Sales grew 2.3%, an exceptional 30.7% on a 2-year basis. We opened 14 net new restaurants and as we continue to invest in scalable infrastructure to support our growth, we are in a strong position to capture the significant whitespace opportunity ahead of us.\"\n\nFiscal First Quarter 2024 Highlights:\n\nCAVA Revenue grew 30.3% to $256.3 million as compared to $196.8 million in the prior year quarter. Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings of 14, bringing total CAVA Restaurants to 323, a 22.8% increase in total CAVA Restaurants year over year. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 2.3%. CAVA AUV of $2.6 million as compared to $2.5 million in the prior year quarter. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit of $64.6 million or growth of 29.3% over the prior year quarter, with CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 25.2%. CAVA Digital Revenue Mix was 37.0%. CAVA Group Net Income of $14.0 million compared to net loss of $2.1 million in the prior year quarter. CAVA Group Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $33.3 million compared to $16.7 million in the prior year quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities of $38.4 million with Free Cash Flow(1) of $4.7 million.\n\nCAVA Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Review:\n\nCAVA Revenue was $256.3 million, an increase of 30.3% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 86 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which are exceeding our performance expectations, and CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 2.3%. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth consists of a 3.5% increase from menu price and product mix, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease from guest traffic. To achieve an optimal comparison of fiscal weeks in the CAVA Same Restaurant Sales calculation giving consideration to holiday periods, each week of fiscal 2023 was shifted by one week. As a result of this shift, approximately $3.9 million of revenue is not included in CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth. Had this shift not been made, CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth would have been 4.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin was 25.2% compared with 25.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The slight decrease was due to incremental wage investments, partially offset by lower food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue, which was driven by higher sales and lower input costs.\n\nCAVA Group Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Review:\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $33.8 million, or 13.1% of revenue, as compared to $29.0 million, or 14.3% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation(1), were $28.7 million, or 11.1% of revenue, as compared to $27.8 million, or 13.7% of revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease of 260 basis points was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation in the prior year quarter and leverage from higher sales, partially offset by investments in our Collaboration Center Organization to support our growth and recurring public company costs.\n\nNet income was $14.0 million, or 5.4% of revenue, an increase of $16.1 million as compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) was $33.3 million, or 12.9% of revenue, an increase of $16.6 million, or 99.0%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the number and strength of performance of Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as leverage in general and administrative expenses and 2.3% CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth.\n\n__________________\n\n(1) General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth in the tables at the end of this press release.\n\nFiscal Full-Year 2024 Outlook:\n\nCAVA Group announced today that it has raised fiscal full-year 2024 guidance, as follows:\n\nFebruary 26, 2024 May 28, 2024 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings 48 to 52 50 to 54 CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth 3.0% to 5.0% 4.5% to 6.5% CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin 22.7% to 23.3% 23.7% to 24.3% Pre-opening costs $11.5 to $12.5 million $12.0 to $13.0 million Adjusted EBITDA $86.0 to $92.0 million $100.0 to $105.0 million\n\nActual results may differ materially from CAVA Group's fiscal full-year 2024 guidance as a result of, among other things, the factors described under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below.\n\nA reconciliation of the forward-looking fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted.\n\nAbout CAVA Group:\n\nCAVA is the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand, bringing together healthful food and bold, satisfying flavors at scale. Our brand and our opportunity transcend the Mediterranean category to compete in the large and growing limited-service restaurant sector as well as the health and wellness food category. CAVA serves guests across gender lines, age groups, and income levels and benefits from generational tailwinds created by consumer demand for healthy living and a demographic shift towards greater ethnic diversity. We meet consumers\u2019 desires to engage with convenient, authentic, purpose-driven brands that view food as a source of self-expression. The broad appeal of our food combined with these favorable industry trends drive our vast opportunity for continued growth.\n\nEarnings Conference Call:\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on May 28, 2024, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time to discuss first quarter 2024 financial results as well as provide a business update. Investors will have the opportunity to listen to the conference call live through the webcast from the company's website on the investor relations page at investor.cava.com. A recorded webcast will be available on CAVA's investor relations website shortly after the call and available for up to one year.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry, business strategy, goals, and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, and other financial and operating information. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"future,\" \"will,\" \"seek,\" \"foreseeable,\" \"outlook,\" the negative version of these words or similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this press release.\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management\u2019s expectations, beliefs, and projections will result or be achieved. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional, or local economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include but are not limited to the following: our operation in a highly competitive industry; our ability to open new restaurants while managing our growth effectively and maintaining our culture; our ability to successfully identify appropriate locations and develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets; the profitability of new restaurants, and any impact to sales at our existing locations; the impact of changes in guest perception of our brand; our ability to successfully market our restaurants and brand; the impact of food safety, health department regulations, and food-borne illness concerns together with our ability to adequately address such concerns and meet regulatory obligations, including at our manufacturing facilities; our ability to maintain or increase prices; our ability to accurately predict guest trends and demand and successfully introduce new menu offerings and improve our existing menu offerings; the risks associated with leasing property; our ability to successfully expand our digital and delivery business; our ability to utilize, recognize, respond to, and effectively manage the immediacy of social media; our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from past and potential future acquisitions, investments or other strategic initiatives; our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively; the impact of shortages, delays, or interruptions in the delivery of food items and other products; our ability to successfully optimize, operate, and manage our production facilities; the risks associated with our reliance on third parties; the impact of increases in food, commodity, energy, and other costs; the impact of increases in labor costs, labor shortages, and our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain the right team members; our ability to attract, develop, and retain our management team and key team members; the impact of any cybersecurity breaches and our ability to respond effectively to technology threats or events; the impact of failures, or interruptions in, or our inability to effectively scale and adapt, our information technology systems; our ability to comply with, or changes in, the extensive laws or regulations requirements to which we are subject, including those related to privacy; the impact of economic factors and guest behavior trends; the impact of evolving rules and regulations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters; risks associated with our ability to secure, and protect our intellectual property; risks associated with civil unrest, acts of terrorism, threats to national security, the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and other geopolitical events, including potential discriminatory perspectives towards certain cuisines; the impact of climate change and volatile adverse weather conditions; and each of the other factors set forth in \"Part I\u2014Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the investor relations page of our website at investor.cava.com.\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this press release. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nIn addition to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow in this press release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) margin, or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management\u2019s discretionary use, as Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, and financing cash flows, and Free Cash Flow does not consider certain cash requirements such as financing cash flows. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the business growth or to reduce indebtedness. Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, and Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow do not reflect cash flows from financing activities of our business; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense, or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, and Free Cash Flow differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nCAVA GROUP, INC.

        "content": "How long will the run in growth stocks continue? The Nasdaq-100 continues to make new all-time highs seemingly almost every week. Every dip, no matter how brief, is instantly bought up as traders pile in to profit from further bullish momentum.\n\nBut trees don\u2019t grow to the sky. At some point, the rally will end. And with the Nasdaq up more than 70% from the 2022 lows, valuations are becoming increasingly untethered from these companies\u2019 underlying fundamentals.\n\nAs metrics such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) head to ever-loftier heights for leading growth stocks, traders should be taking a wary look toward the exits. At some point the momentum will reverse, and the ensuing selling could be swift. These are seven especially risky growth stocks to sell now while prices are still favorable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is the worldwide leader in streaming music. While streaming audio is a highly competitive market in North America, in emerging markets such as Latin America, Spotify has taken a dominant position in music streaming.\n\nThis led many investors, myself included, to think that Spotify could exhibit monopoly-like characteristics. In turn, this would allow Spotify to raise prices, hammer out better contracts with the record labels and greatly improve profit margins.\n\nI was a longtime investor in SPOT stock, but I sold my position and am now bearish simply because that thesis didn\u2019t play out whatsoever.\n\nSpecifically, in 2018, Spotify generated a gross profit margin of 25.7%. In 2023, its gross profit margin fell to 25.6%. Despite adding hundreds of millions of users, investing heavily in content like podcasts and building its brand dramatically, Spotify wasn\u2019t able to use that to improve the business\u2019 economics whatsoever.\n\nThat is reflected on the bottom line as well. Spotify generated a net loss of $89 million in 2018. This ballooned to a loss of $580 million in 2023. The company has yet to generate a GAAP profit on a full-year basis. While Spotify stock has more than doubled over the past year, its underlying business economics are as fuzzy as ever.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) shares sold off sharply following a recent downbeat earnings report. Despite that, however, DUOL stock is still up dramatically in the bigger picture with shares rallying approximately 150% since the start of 2023.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Duolingo has brought a fresh and innovative approach to the language-learning arena. I live abroad and have met many fellow expats that have had positive experiences with Duolingo to help jumpstart their studies. That said, a good app isn\u2019t necessarily a great business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is still trading at 12x enterprise value to sales, and shares are going for more than 100x forward earnings. That\u2019s quite expensive, especially as AI translation apps and tools threaten to limit the total addressable market for Duolingo\u2019s services.\n\nFurthermore, the free version of Duolingo\u2019s flagship application is quite powerful, making monetization a tricky challenge as many users see no reason to upgrade. Things such as\u00a0English testing certifications are interesting and could work over time, but the company will need to do more to demonstrate success.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\n25 years ago,\u00a0Dell (NYSE:DELL) was a popular investment as it was at the forefront of major trends in consumer electronics hardware.\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case. In 2024, Dell is primarily known for being a staid IT vendor. Its business is consistent but rarely grows much, and Wall Street usually assigns it a low valuation.\n\nBut all Dell had to do was sprinkle in a touch of AI and the whole narrative has flipped. Now people have forgotten that Dell\u2019s core business is a slow-moving one, as traders latch onto DELL as a hidden AI pick. DELL stock is now up 250% over the past 12 months and its valuation multiples are rising.\n\nMake no mistake, Dell is selling some AI enabled servers and hardware. That\u2019s certainly useful to some extent. But reselling the latest generation of hardware is a much different position within the AI space than being the innovator creating the underlying technology. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin sees more than\u00a060% downside for DELL stock from current levels as the hype wears off, with a fair value target of just $55 compared to today\u2019s $160 price.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is probably not the first name people think of as a growth stock. However, the club store operator is in the Nasdaq index, and it\u2019s also certainly trading like a growth stock.\n\nWith shares at fresh all-time highs, Costco is now trading for more than 50 times earnings. That\u2019s the highest valuation COST stock has achieved in decades. It\u2019s one thing for a small start-up with a tiny revenue base to trade for 50 times earnings; it\u2019s quite another for a dominant retailer that already has a fairly saturated store base.\n\nCostco has grown earnings per share at an 11.8% annualized clip over the past decade. That\u2019s impressive stuff. But is it worthy of a 50x P/E ratio? Probably not.\n\nParticularly if the economy starts to roll over, Costco could be vulnerable to dramatic downside. If COST stock returned to a 30x P/E ratio \u2014 hardly a fire sale price \u2014 that would imply 40% downside on the stock from here. And if earnings dropped as well during a recession, losses could be even greater.\n\nCostco is a great business. But it\u2019s priced for perfection right now and any sort of economic or operational hiccup could be devastating.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava Group (NYSE:CAVA) is a recent initial public offering (IPO) that has become one of the hottest growth stocks in the restaurant space. The expectation is that Cava will become the Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) of Mediterranean food.\n\nAnd at this price, it had better achieve that goal, otherwise shareholders will be left with indigestion.\n\nSpecifically, CAVA is trading at 13x revenues, 150x EBITDA, and more than 300x forward earnings. The thinking is that Cava will open far more stores around the country and grow into its valuation over time. But it\u2019s far from assured that the same Cava menu that is so popular in major tier-1 urban areas will play as well in other parts of America.\n\nThe fast casual market dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. If Cava becomes the next Panera or Chipotle, shareholders could still make money even from today\u2019s lofty valuation. But the more likely outcome is that Cava will see growth slow at some point \u2014 such as during a recession \u2014 and its share price will dramatically deflate.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the global leaders in the memory category of semiconductor firms.\n\nThe memory market is known for its dramatic boom/bust cycle. The memory market used to be highly competitive with more than a dozen rivals. Over time this consolidated down to a few major players, and analysts hoped that memory firms could enjoy steady consistent profitability.\n\nBut rumors of the cycle\u2019s demise\u00a0were overblown. As it would turn out, as soon as computer and smartphone demand rolled over in 2023, so did Micron\u2019s business. The company lost a prodigious sum of money in 2023.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to return to at least breakeven results this year. But times are hardly good for Micron, with shares still trading for more than 150x forward earnings. Traders have latched onto AI as a catalyst for Micron, but its AI solutions are a fractional revenue line within its larger business.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s William Kerwin agrees that MU stock is wildly overvalued. He believes shares are worth just $80 today, implying that the stock has 38% downside from here. Kerwin gives MU stock a 1-star rating and warns that the company has no competitive moat and faces dramatic risks from its exposure to the Chinese market.\n\nAppLovin (APP) The AppLovin (APP) info on an iPhone and laptop screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company which develops and operates a mobile marketing platform and ecosystem. It offers products such as AppDiscovery, MAX and SparkLabs.\n\nAppLovin, as the name might suggest, primarily helps mobile application developers to monetize their programs, and further boost their marketing and consumer engagement efforts.\n\nAPP stock has gone on an absolute tear over the past year with the shares rising more than 230%.\n\nInvestors are pleased that AppLovin has been able to work around some of the\u00a0privacy restrictions that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other operators have put in their ecosystems. AppLovin is certainly making progress as a business and its AI ad system is also sparking investor enthusiasm.\n\nWhile AppLovin is enjoying a large increase in revenues in 2024, analysts believe this is a temporary development tied to solving particular pain points such as Apple\u2019s privacy moves. Once the current revenue growth spurt ends, analysts see revenue growth dropping to just 12% for FY\u2019 25 and 11% for FY \u201926. Traders are currently extrapolating AppLovin\u2019s strong earnings results into the indefinite future, but APP stock could be in for a rude awakening once growth inevitably slows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Cava (CAVA): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CAVA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Cava, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs CAVA a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Cava, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.9% over the past month to $0.25.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Cava. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Cava may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "CAVA Group, Inc. CAVA is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter 2024 results on May 28. In the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 100%.\n\nHow are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter 2024 earnings per share has remained stable at 3 cents over the past 30 days. In the last quarter, the company reported earnings per share of 2 cents.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for total revenues is pegged at $245.9 million, suggesting a sequential gain of 38.9% from the reported figure of $177 million.\n\nKey Factors to Consider\n\nThe company\u2019s results are likely to be aided by menu price increases and a favorable product mix. These positive factors are likely to have driven CAVA restaurant\u2019s sales growth. Additionally, new restaurant openings are expected to have supported growth.\r\n\r\nThe company's emphasis on category-defining brands and highly differentiated product offerings has bolstered growth prospects to some extent. A sequential improvement in visitation is likely to have driven the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAVA Group restaurant sales is pegged at $243 million, up 38.9% sequentially.\r\n\r\nHowever, increases in food, beverage and packaging expenses, along with labor inflation due to higher average hourly wages, are likely to have negatively impacted the company\u2019s bottom line. Commodity inflation is also likely to have been an overhang.\n\nCAVA Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCAVA Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CAVA Group, Inc. Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for CAVA Group this time around. Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates. This is not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: CAVA has an Earnings ESP of -66.67%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share is pegged at 4 cents, which suggests a sharp decline from the year-ago reported number of 13 cents.\r\n\r\nKohl's top line is expected to decline year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $3.54 billion, which indicates a drop of 0.9% from the prior-year quarter. KSS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 84.2%, on average.\r\n\r\nBath & Body Works BBWI currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.23% and a Zacks Rank of 2.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share is pegged at 33 cents, flat year over year.

BBWI has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 23.2%, on average.\r\n\r\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters AEO currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.98% and a Zacks Rank #3.

        "title": "1 Magnificent Stock Up 89% in 2024: Is It a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity?",
        "content": "In the past five years, Chipotle has crushed it for shareholders, skyrocketing 340%. The Tex-Mex fast casual concept is still expanding rapidly, while posting incredible profitability. It makes sense that investors seeking the next big industry winner are now taking a closer look at Cava (NYSE: CAVA), a much smaller chain.\n\nThis surging restaurant stock is already up nearly 90% year to date. Does this powerful momentum make Cava a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?\n\nBig growth plans\n\nCava focuses on Mediterranean food, using a similar model to Chipotle that allows hungry patrons to build their own salads, grain bowls, or pitas. Clearly, this is catching on with consumers. Management points to a growing interest from the general public in making healthy food choices as a key tailwind, and Cava's fast-casual approach only increases accessibility and convenience for its customers.\n\nDespite inflationary pressures and general economic uncertainty, Cava continues to put up strong growth figures. In 2023, revenue jumped 59.8%, boosted by 72 new store openings and a 17.9% same-store sales growth. Last year's sales figure of $729 million was 518% higher than five years ago in 2018.\n\nBusinesses that are investing aggressively in growth initiatives typically aren't profitable, so it might be surprising to learn that Cava bucks this trend. It registered $13.3 million in net income last year after posting a $59 million net loss in 2022. The hope for shareholders is that consistent and rising earnings will become the norm.\n\nBy 2032, the executive team believes it can have 1,000 locations open across the U.S., up from 309 (as of Dec. 31, 2023). This growth potential is probably what investors are most excited about.\n\nHigh expectations\n\nIt should come as no surprise that investors hope Cava can mirror the long-term success of Chipotle. Even with 3,500 existing locations, the fast-casual leader is expanding at a blistering pace with 271 store openings last year. Shares have been a huge winner for investors, thanks to the strong revenue and earnings growth that show no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe resulting expectations for Cava are high, and the stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11.1, a 30% premium to Chipotle. I'm not sure if this steep multiple is warranted.\n\nCava's valuation implies that management's long-term target of opening 1,000 stores is a virtual certainty, perhaps at an even faster pace than the leadership team's 2032 deadline. But I'm not as confident.\n\nGrowth is already forecast to slow dramatically. The company plans to open 50 net new locations (at the midpoint of guidance) in 2024, a meaningful drop from last year. Even worse, same-store sales are only set to rise 3% to 5%, an extremely disappointing outlook given the company's double-digit growth last year. For comparison's sake, Chipotle is projecting mid- to high-single-digit comparable-sales growth this year, even though it's already a much bigger enterprise that's further penetrated in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition is a critical factor investors can't ignore. The restaurant sector is perhaps the most competitive in the world, and finding lasting success is extremely difficult. Cava has to constantly win over diners who are overwhelmed with options\u00a0 -- even the Mediterranean category is crowded with lots of choices. Without an economic moat, I have my concerns about the company's success over the next decade and beyond.\n\nTo its credit, Cava is developing name recognition that people are excited about, but that's not enough to make it a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Right now, investors are on top of the world. The major American equity indexes seemingly hit new record highs almost every week. Innovations in fields such as artificial intelligence offer tremendous promise to grow corporate earnings and lead to new technological breakthroughs.\n\nBut the good times won\u2019t last forever. They never do. Whether the market rolls over next week, next quarter, or years from now, there will inevitably come a point when things get ugly out there on Wall Street once again.\n\nThey say the best time to buy an umbrella is while the sun is still shining. In the same way, it\u2019s a great time to pick up some defensive stocks to own in tough times while the markets are still at record highs. Because, whenever that correction comes, it\u2019s best to prepare in advance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCarriage Services (CSV) A funeral scene with casket and flowers.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCarriage Services (NYSE:CSV) is one of the most recession-resistant businesses imaginable.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the company offers funeral and cemetery services. Regardless of what\u2019s going on with the economy, people are unable to cheat death.\n\nIn fact, perversely, shares of Carriage Services soared during the pandemic as investors speculated that COVID-19 would lead to higher death rates and thus more activity at Carriage Services. Thankfully, that scenario largely didn\u2019t come to pass, and CSV stock quickly retreated to its pre-pandemic levels.\n\nCarriage Services is not a fast-growing business, for obvious reasons. However, its revenues are about as dependable as they come. And shares are currently being offered at just 12 times forward earnings. The company is also currently\u00a0paying down debt, which should help profitability in the current higher interest rate environment.\n\nWhile Carriage Services is hardly the most exciting business in the world, it\u2019s just the sort of security you might want to own when times get tough. And at today\u2019s starting price, that defensive portfolio is at ]an attractive entry point.\n\nHormel Foods (HRL) Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a packaged foods company focused on protein products. Known for its canned pork product Spam, the Hormel of nowadays is more focused on health-conscious products such as natural and organic meats, guacamole, Mexican salsas, and nuts and nut butter.\n\nLike many consumer staples companies, Hormel stock has dramatically underperformed the stock market over the past couple of years. Hormel\u2019s profit margins have been hit as prices of key commodities such as livestock and grains surged. In addition, investors are less interested in perceived stodgy blue-chip sorts of companies during a raging bull market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a downturn, however, that will change. Food consumption often seems almost unaffected by changes in broader economic conditions. If anything, a weakening economy will cause some folks to trade down from restaurant meals to grocery shopping, and Hormel\u2019s protein-forward offerings make for filling entrees and snacks.\n\nHRL stock has started to bounce back in 2024 as the company\u2019s margins have inflected upward. It\u2019s starting to look like Hormel is a great contrarian bet for this year and beyond and perhaps among the stocks to own in tough times.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nTurning from groceries to fast food, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is another bargain food option whose value proposition shines during recessions.\n\nRecently, expensive fast-casual options such as Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG) and Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) have dominated the fast food market. In a growing economy, it makes sense for people to splurge on these interesting offerings, particularly as younger consumers tend to prioritize health-conscious dining options.\n\nIn an economic recession, however, the appetite for $18 salads tends to dry up. People return to tried-and-true budget options. McDonald\u2019s, with its worldwide brand and fast affordable menu offerings, fits the bill perfectly.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is also more stable than most of its rivals since it owns so much of the land under its restaurants. In fact, some people have joked that McDonald\u2019s is a real estate business that has a side hustle flipping hamburgers.\n\nIn short, McDonald\u2019s has a strong balance sheet and a business built to shine during recessions. MCD stock has underperformed recently, giving investors a chance to buy this safe haven blue chip stock at a discount today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HRL stock.

        "content": "Consumer spending on outdoor dining appears to be reaching new heights following the pandemic. Notably, several Zacks Retail-Restaurants stocks have hit 52-week highs this spring and could have more upside ahead.\n\nTo that point, the trend of upward earnings estimate revisions suggests the blazing price performances of these retail-restaurant stocks could continue going into the summer. This has contributed to their buy ratings and these restaurants are seeing expansive growth on their top and bottom lines.\n\nWith now looking like an ideal time to invest here are three of these top-rated retail-restaurant stocks to consider.\n\nBrinker International EAT\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)\n\nOutside of its steady growth, Brinker International\u2019s stock is still attractive in terms of valuation despite soaring +48% year to date and currently trading at a 52-week high of $64 a share. Still, the operator of Chili\u2019s Grill & Bar and Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy trades at a 15.9X forward earnings multiple which is a pleasant discount to the industry average of 24.1X and the S&P 500\u2019s 22.2X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmid this year\u2019s rally, rising earnings estimates have kept Brinker International\u2019s P/E valuation reasonable. In this regard, fiscal 2024 and FY25 EPS estimates have spiked 6% in the last 30 days respectively. Brinker International's annual earnings are now expected to climb 39% this year to $3.94 per share compared to $2.83 a share in 2023. Another 11% EPS growth is in the forecast for FY25. Plus, total sales are projected to rise 5% in FY24 and are slated to increase another 3% next year to $4.47 billion.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWingstop WING\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)\n\nAlso boasting a strong buy rating, earnings estimates are noticeably higher for Wingstop in the last month with FY24 and FY25 EPS estimates now up 13% over the last 60 days. It\u2019s noteworthy that Wingstop has an \u201cA\u201d Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth as annual earnings are forecasted to climb 36% in FY24 and are projected to soar another 22% in FY25 to $4.14 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMore impressive, Wingstop\u2019s total sales are projected to soar 27% this year with the company\u2019s top line expected to expand another 17% in FY25 to $685.82 million. Correlating with its growth trajectory, Wingstop\u2019s stock is up +49% YTD with WING hitting highs of $389 earlier in the month. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCAVA Group CAVA\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy)\n\nThe healthy food choice options and growing popularity of the Mediterranean-style food chain Cava Group should be catching investors' attention as well. In addition to its buy rating, Cava Group\u2019s stock has an \u201cA\u201d Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nCava Group\u2019s sales are projected to increase 20% in FY24 and are forecasted to climb another 19% in FY25 to $1.04 billion. More importantly, earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last 60 days with EPS expected to jump 19% this year and projected to increase another 34% in FY25 to $0.33 a share.\n\nFurthermore, since going public in June of last year, CAVA has now soared +84% and hit a high of $84 today. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWingstop and Cava Group are two of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the United States and Brinker International's expansion and valuation remain compelling.

        "title": "Should You Buy Cava Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Every restaurant investor is looking for the next Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). The fast-casual restaurant chain has posted phenomenal returns for investors after taking its healthy Mexican fare across the U.S. The company currently has a market capitalization of $86 billion, making it one of the largest restaurant brands in the world.\n\nThe success of Chipotle has spawned a lot of fast-casual restaurant copycats. One of the most successful is Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), which has a similar concept to Chipotle but with Mediterranean food. It is growing its restaurant count like gangbusters and went public through an initial public offering (IPO) less than a year ago.\n\nShould you buy Cava stock for your portfolio right now?\n\nMediterranean fast casual? Mediterranean fast casual\n\nCava does build-your-own grain bowls and sandwich wraps in a similar fashion to Chipotle. But instead of Mexican food, it does Mediterranean wraps with falafel, hummus, and pita bread. In 2023, Cava locations did $2.6 million in average unit volumes (AUVs) with 24.8% restaurant-level profit margins. This novel concept seems to be resonating with customers, as foot traffic per store increased 10% year over year in 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Cava had 309 restaurant units. Last year, it generated $717.1 million in revenue, up an astonishing 60% from 2022. The company is expanding rapidly with this restaurant concept, and doing so while still generating a profit. Cava Group net income was $13.9 million in 2023. It is rare to find a company growing this quickly that is also profitable, which is a great sign for investors.\n\nIncoming national expansion\n\nIn its IPO documents, management said it thinks there is room for at least 1,000 Cava restaurant locations in the United States. Last year, it opened 72 stores, and it plans to open 50 more in 2024. If the company opens 50 restaurants each year, it will hit around 1,000 units 14 years from now. This gives the company a long runway to reinvest for growth, which is important for growth stock investors to consider.\n\nAssuming AUVs can expand to $3 million -- a conservative estimate if you think inflation is even slightly positive -- 1,000 units should equate to $3 billion in annual sales from Cava restaurants. That would be more than 4x its 2023 sales levels, even with conservative AUV assumptions. The company began on the East Coast of the United States and now has toeholds in places like California and Colorado.\n\nWith comparable sales still strong at 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, it looks like Cava's fast-casual concept is resonating around the country. This should indicate to investors that Cava can reinvest in new markets like Colorado and California with strong returns to drive revenue and earnings higher for years to come.\n\nStory continues CAVA PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe stock is not cheap\n\nCava has a long runway of growth ahead of it. That doesn't automatically make the stock a buy, though. Growth is just a factor in valuing a stock. The price you pay matters too.\n\nToday, Cava has a market cap of $8.8 billion. Let's assume the company hits its $3 billion revenue target and can hit Chipotle-level profit margins of 17%. That would equate to $510 million in annual earnings on $3 billion in sales. Compared to today's market cap, that's a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 17. This feels like a reasonable valuation for a maturing restaurant stock.\n\nBut how many years forward will these earnings show up? Eight? 10? A restaurant concept can't magically grow 1,000 new locations overnight. For this reason, I think investors are aggressively pricing in future growth at Cava.

        "content": "The Retail-Wholesale group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Cava Group (CAVA) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Retail-Wholesale sector should help us answer this question.\n\nCava Group is one of 213 individual stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #12 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Cava Group is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWithin the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAVA's full-year earnings has moved 60.2% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\n\nOur latest available data shows that CAVA has returned about 83% since the start of the calendar year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Retail-Wholesale group have gained about 10.8% on average. This means that Cava Group is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nAnother Retail-Wholesale stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is Sprouts Farmers (SFM). The stock has returned 59.7% year-to-date.\n\nOver the past three months, Sprouts Farmers' consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 10%. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nTo break things down more, Cava Group belongs to the Retail - Restaurants industry, a group that includes 42 individual companies and currently sits at #157 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, this group has lost an average of 0.4% so far this year, meaning that CAVA is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nSprouts Farmers, however, belongs to the Food - Natural Foods Products industry. Currently, this 6-stock industry is ranked #23. The industry has moved +19.7% so far this year.\n\nCava Group and Sprouts Farmers could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Retail-Wholesale stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "$35 million facility produces dips, spreads, and dressings for CAVA\u2019s restaurants and consumer packaged goods business\n\nGovernment officials and dignitaries to speak at today\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony\n\nWASHINGTON, May 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CAVA (NYSE: CAVA), the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand, today announced the official opening of a new, state-of-the-art food production and packaging facility in Verona, Virginia, located two hours outside Washington D.C., in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nAs part of its ongoing work to build a scalable infrastructure to support its growth, the company made an initial investment of approximately $35 million in the facility, which manufactures CAVA\u2019s proprietary dips and spreads, including tzatziki, harissa, and Crazy Feta\u00ae, as well as select dressings. Along with an existing facility in Laurel, Maryland, the Verona operation can support at least 750 restaurants and the expansion of CAVA\u2019s consumer packaged goods business.\n\n\"CAVA Foods Verona is part of a vertically integrated model that supports our business now and over the long term. By centrally producing our dips and spreads, we reduce complexity in our restaurants, improve costs overall, and maintain the quality, consistency, and integrity of our chef-crafted recipes at scale,\" said Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO. \"We\u2019re excited to be part of the Verona community and grateful for our ongoing partnership with Augusta County and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\"\n\nThe Verona facility has the capacity to produce more than 100,000 pounds of product a day using high-pressure processing, a cold pasteurization technology that retains the flavor and nutritional benefits of CAVA\u2019s fresh ingredients, with no preservatives.\n\nThe facility also features ecological landscaping, airy, welcoming spaces for team members, and a custom, state-of-the-art, and environmentally friendly CO2 refrigeration system that cools production and warehouse spaces.\n\n\"It is an honor to welcome CAVA to the Shenandoah Valley and celebrate the company\u2019s plans for growth,\" said Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. \"The new manufacturing facility will play a crucial role in the economic development of Augusta County, alongside the other renowned business in Mill Place Commerce Park. I look forward to the continued success of the partnership between CAVA and the Commonwealth.\"\n\nRepresentatives from CAVA, Augusta County, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, including Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade, Caren Merrick, are scheduled to give remarks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony today.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo learn more about CAVA, follow @CAVA on social channels, including TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, and others.

        "title": "CAVA Group (NYSE:CAVA): Investors\u2019 Appetite for the Salad Chain Is Growing",
        "content": "After Mediterranean-themed restaurant CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) served up strong growth last year, investors are hoping for a second course in 2024. Shares of the fast-casual chain hit a fresh record high of $77.14 on Monday, less than a year after opening at an IPO price of $42.00. The mid-cap high-flier is up more than 70% year-to-date and is showing no sign of slowing down.\n\nCAVA Group is an up-and-coming restaurant operator that is based in Washington, D.C. Boldly going head-to-head with Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), it offers a variety of heart-healthy Mediterranean bowls and pitas at locations across the United States.\n\nCAVA Group stock is currently on an impressive seven-month win streak on the backs of some strong 2023 financials. In a tough discretionary spending environment, the company grew revenue and same-restaurant sales by 60% and 18%, respectively, last year. It is not only growing by expanding its footprint but also by generating higher sales at existing locations.\n\nIn addition to producing strong top-line growth, CAVA Group is already profitable. The company has recorded profits in each of the first three quarters since going public in June 2023. It is also three-for-three in surpassing Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates.\n\nI am optimistic about CAVA Group\u2019s potential to replicate its above-industry growth, going forward. The restaurant chain has created a niche category within the fast-growing limited-service restaurant space. Its food matches consumers\u2019 increasing demand for healthy protein, vegetables, and fruits as part of broader U.S. health and wellness trends. By the second half of this year, CAVA Group plans to have steak on the menu at all locations.\n\nCAVA Group is poised to build off its recent success by staying in tune with customer preferences and opening many new stores.\n\nAggressive Store Expansion\n\nIn 2023, CAVA Group opened 72 new restaurants, a 30% increase from 2022. This was a gutsy move, considering inflation and elevated credit card rates had big impacts on American discretionary budgets. The company is doubling down on its aggressive expansion strategy. It expects to build 48 to 52 more restaurants this year to bring its total unit count to at least 357. This may only be the beginning.\n\nCAVA Group ended 2023 with 309 restaurants across 24 U.S. states. Management believes the company is in the early stages of expansion and has the potential to top 1,000 locations by 2032. The company generally targets upper-middle-income households in highly populated urban and suburban settings. Catering to higher-earning consumers definitely played a role in last year\u2019s outperformance, and this makes CAVA Group a relatively economy-proof restaurant stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Midwest U.S. is expected to be a focus area for 2024 expansion. This plan was confirmed on April 26 when CAVA Group opened its first Chicago-area location. It marked the chain\u2019s first step into the upper Midwest market. The Southeastern and Southwestern U.S. is where CAVA Group has its largest presence, with more than 130 locations.\n\nLater this month, we\u2019ll learn if the company\u2019s growth strategy is off to a good start this year. CAVA Group is scheduled to announce 2024 first-quarter financial results after the market closes on May 28. In the fourth quarter of 2023, higher premium item orders and moderating input costs led to a surprise profit. The current consensus estimate for 2024 first-quarter EPS is $0.03.\n\nIs CAVA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nDespite the stock\u2019s strong year-to-date performance, Wall Street research firms remain mostly bullish on CAVA Group. In the past three months, the stock has received eight Buy ratings and three Hold ratings.\n\nLast month, Argus Research analyst Christine Dooley upgraded CAVA Group from Hold to Buy. Dooley pounced on the sell-off from a 52-week high to raise her rating, saying the restaurant \u201chas a long runway to growth.\u201d\n\nAlso last month, Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan kept a Buy rating on CAVA Group. Setyan similarly thinks the company is well-positioned for long-term growth driven by store expansion, menu innovation, digital initiatives, and a revamped loyalty program. The analyst set a Street-high $74.00 price target on CAVA.\n\nWhat Is the Consensus Price Target for CAVA Stock?\n\nCAVA Group shares have already exceeded Wall Street\u2019s highest price target of $74.00. Meanwhile, the latest CAVA stock consensus price target is $63.82, which implies 13.9% downside from current levels. This could mean CAVA is due for a pullback. On the other hand, another strong earnings report could cause analysts to boost their price targets.\n\nThe Bottom Line on CAVA Stock\n\nCAVA Group shares have more than doubled from their October 2023 low due to better-than-expected earnings releases and a bright long-term growth outlook. As the company\u2019s aggressive expansion story plays out, growth metrics could continue to impress. The stock appears overheated in the near term, though, so waiting for a dip may suit bullish investors.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Reddit Earnings Forecast Spark Community Debate About Platform's Value\n\nReddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) reveals its first-quarter earnings today (Tuesday). Wall Street expects -$8.71 in EPS and $212.83 million in revenues as the company reports after market hours.\n\nThe stock is up 1.74% over the past month and up 2.72% over the past five days. After the stock\u2019s initial plunge post-IPO on March 21, it hadn\u2019t moved much. Reddit stock investors now pegged their hopes on the first-quarter earnings to move the needle.\n\nAs Reddit\u2019s earnings announcement loomed, discussions on r/wallstreetbets were heating up with users like Capable-Jicama2155 advocating for a bullish stance on the platform\u2019s future.\n\nDespite Reddit\u2019s status as the third most-visited website in the U.S., its market cap sits at a modest $7 billion, prompting comparisons to companies like CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA), which boasts a market cap of $8 billion. 3Redditors found Reddit\u2019s potential for growth intriguing, especially with its unique user data and high ceiling for user-generated content, rivaled only by YouTube.\n\nAlso Read: Trump Media Vs.

Adding to the discussion, Redditor mfairview highlighted Reddit\u2019s revenue potential, which was expected to surpass a billion this year.\n\nOn the flip side, Redditor ms_channandler_bong pointed out Reddit\u2019s expected EPS of -$8.71 and the CEO\u2019s ownership of 61.5% of class A shares, signaling potential pitfalls. Redditor newebay provided context, explaining that the CEO\u2019s ownership is less significant due to the distribution of class A shares.\n\nRedditor fenriswulfwsb offered a word of caution, warning about low liquidity in Reddit\u2019s option chain, and advising traders to be mindful of premiums and potential difficulties in exiting positions.\n\nAs Redditors weigh the pros and cons, the community eagerly awaits Reddit\u2019s earnings report to see if their speculations align with reality.\n\nReddit\u2019s first quarter 2024 earnings call can be watched here (live at market close):\n\nRead Next: Reddit Analysts Expect \u2018Strong Beat And Raise, Healthy Engagement Trends\u2019 For Q1 Earnings\n\nPhoto: Ink Drop/Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Reddit Earnings Forecast Spark Community Debate About Platform's Value originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The stock market had a strong 2023, which carried into 2024. After some initial declines in April, tech giants reported strong earnings that raised the stock market. However, there are some concerns beyond the horizon. Higher inflation, elevated interest rates and significant consumer debt can lead to obstacles in the future and stocks to avoid.\n\nInvestors shouldn\u2019t offload their portfolios during a crash. Holding onto stocks for several years, if not decades, can lead to meaningful long-term results. However, some positions are better than others. You may want to check your portfolio and make sure it doesn\u2019t include any of these three stocks to avoid.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) is a contrarian pick for this list since investors got excited about the company\u2019s recent earnings report. The Q1 2024 print got investors excited and resulted in a 28% gain for the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe most notable change was the company\u2019s 21% year-over-year revenue growth. That\u2019s the number you want to see from a growth stock. Daily active users also increased by 10% year-over-year. However, there are some issues.\n\nThe company\u2019s net loss came to $305 million. That\u2019s an improvement from a Q1 2023 net loss of $329 million, but a 7% improvement is not enough. Snap is still deep in debt, and an economic slowdown will bring the company\u2019s revenue growth to an immediate halt.\n\nQ2 guidance implies 15% to 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Snapchat+ subscription growth is driving some of the gains, and revenue has grown by 194% year-over-year. However, the company is still well removed from GAAP profitability. I\u2019d be somewhat interested if the company didn\u2019t have a $24 billion market cap or made more progress with trimming its losses.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo is over an orange background with a little shopping cart with packages in it. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy\u2019s (NASDAQ:ETSY) growth days look like they are over. Q4 2023 consolidated gross merchandise sales dropped by 0.7% year-over-year in a time when other e-commerce corporations reported good revenue growth. While Etsy did achieve 4.3% year-over-year revenue growth, that growth came from charging higher fees. There\u2019s a limit to how much Etsy can charge before users look for other platforms.\n\nIf consolidated gross merchandise sales remain flat, the company will continue to struggle. Etsy already warned about a bad Q1 2024, with GMS expected to decline in the low-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. Leadership expects a turnaround to develop in Q2 2024. That can be due to Etsy facing more generous comps.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter soaring during the pandemic amid impressive financial growth, Etsy has collapsed. Shares are down by 33% over the past year and have dropped by 17% year-to-date. It\u2019s hard to feel excited about the stock, and an economic downturn that weakens consumer spending can spell more trouble for the e-commerce firm.\n\nCava (CAVA)  Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPutting Cava (NYSE:CAVA) on this list is tough. The Mediterranean trend is strong, Cava is expanding, and it has the potential to be a great pick for investors with 10-year time horizons.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s hard to ignore the 330 P/E ratio for a restaurant chain expected to slow down in fiscal 2024. Cava opened 72 restaurants in Fiscal 2023 to bring its total up to 309 restaurants. That\u2019s a 30.4% year-over-year increase in the number of total Cava restaurants. Revenue growth also came in strong, 52.5% higher than last year\u2019s period. Net income also flipped positive to $2.0 million compared to a net loss of $18.8 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nHowever, the company only anticipates opening 48-52 new restaurants in fiscal 2024. That\u2019s only a 16.2% year-over-year improvement compared to the company\u2019s 309 restaurants.\n\nThe company also expects same-restaurant sales growth to hover only from 3.0% to 5.0% year-over-year in fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, the company posted 17.9% year-over-year same restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2023. Decelerating sales can pressure the stock, especially since it has gained 69% year-to-date.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Cava Group (CAVA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCava currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CAVA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CAVA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Cava here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Cava, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in CAVA?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Cava, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.6% over the past month to $0.25.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Cava. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Cava may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.49%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.04%.\n\nThe Mediterranean restaurant chain's stock has climbed by 3.2% in the past month, exceeding the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 2.49% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.5%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Cava Group will be of great interest to investors.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $0.25 per share and revenue of $874 million, which would represent changes of +19.05% and +19.94%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Cava Group. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.59% higher. Currently, Cava Group is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, Cava Group currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 285.62. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 21.83, which means Cava Group is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 158, which puts it in the bottom 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups.

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Cava Group (CAVA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 27, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.04 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.03 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Cava Group has an Earnings ESP of 55.56%.\n\nCAVA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at AutoZone (AZO) as well.\n\nSlated to report earnings on May 28, 2024, AutoZone holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $35.85 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nAutoZone's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.26% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.75.\n\nCAVA and AZO's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Forget Starbucks: Buy This Unstoppable Growth Stock Instead",
        "content": "Historically, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has been a big winner on the stock market.\n\nThe company essentially pioneered the modern-day coffeehouse concept in the 1990's and the format has been copied by a wide range of competitors, including independent coffee shops and large chains.\n\nHoward Schultz's fundamental innovation, bringing espresso drinks to the American market and adapting the experience to American tastes, generated tens of billions of dollar market value for Starbucks and made the brand famous around the world.\n\nHowever, these days Starbucks appears to be struggling. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last few years, comparable sales growth has been sluggish, and Starbucks' reputation has suffered due to a unionization push that has led to some stores closing.\n\nInvestors looking for the kind of growth that Starbucks represented in its earlier years are better off looking elsewhere. And one top restaurant stock to consider is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA). Image source Cava.\n\nThe next restaurant star?\n\nCava has been a publicly traded stock for less than a year, but it's showing the strength of a much more mature restaurant company. The company combines strong comparable sales, an aggressive expansion strategy, improving restaurant-level operating margins, and a proven business model.\n\nCava is a Mediterranean fast-casual chain and resembles Chipotle in a number of ways. Like Chipotle, Cava's menu is focused around rolled-up pita sandwiches that resemble burritos as well as bowls.\n\nThe fast-casual chain is also well-represented in the digital channel as digital orders made up 36% of its revenue last year.\n\nIts other results help show Cava's potential. Revenue jumped 60% last year to $717.1 million as it opened 72 locations. The company now operates more than 300 restaurants, benefiting from its acquisition and rebranding of Zoe's Kitchen.\n\nComparable sales last year surged 18%, and the company recorded average unit volumes of $2.6 million, showing its restaurants bring in high volumes of customers, a bullish sign for the company's future growth.\n\nOn the bottom line, Cava's growth story is also taking shape. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $73.6 margin compared to $12.6 million in the quarter. Restaurant-level operating profit nearly expanded 450 basis points to 24.8%.\n\nWhy Cava could be a long-term winner\n\nThe restaurant industry is competitive but it isn't complicated. Companies with profitable, popular business models like Starbucks and Chipotle tend to do well, and Cava has the makings of another industry star, as it has a lot of room to add restaurants and its brand seems to be resonating with consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt just opened its first restaurant in the Midwest, for example, opening its doors in Chicago.\n\nCava also has something of a wild card up its sleeve. Ron Shaich, the founder of Panera Bread and Au Bon Pain, early pioneers in the fast-casual industry. Cava didn't find Shaich. He found Cava as he was an early investor in the company, purchasing a stake when it had just a few locations open.\n\nGiven his success with Panera and Au Bon Pain, having Shaich on board seems like a significant advantage for a young fast-casual chain.\n\nFinally, Cava also trades at a reasonable valuation for its growth potential as it currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 5.5, about even with Chipotle.\n\nCava clearly has the momentum to deliver strong returns to investors. While success in the restaurant industry doesn't happen overnight, Cava seems well prepared with a popular menu and concept, strength of the digital channel, and the guidance of Ron Shaich as Chairman.\n\nThe Mediterranean fast-casual chain has all the pieces to be the next great restaurant stock. Long-term investors should be rewarded.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Cava Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Restaurant brands come and go, but when a concept is new and attractive it can lead to exciting stories on Wall Street. That's basically what's going on today with Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant that's drawing in customers in huge numbers. The next three years are likely to see the company grow at a rapid clip.\n\nBut investors need to go in with their eyes wide open, and keenly focused on this key industry metric.\n\nCava is tapping the Chipotle playbook\n\nCava's restaurant concept isn't really new. It basically rips off Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE: CMG) assembly line approach to food preparation, but it does it with Mediterranean food instead of Mexican fare. However, this fact makes the comparison here pretty obvious. To lay some important groundwork, at the end of 2023 Chipotle had 3,371 locations in the United States (and another 66 foreign locations). Cava's store count at the end of 2023 was just 309. CMG Chart\n\nCava's entire store base would be little more than a rounding error for Chipotle. But this hints at the potential growth opportunity ahead for Cava, even if it only manages to grow to half the size of Chipotle. Notably, in 2023 the company pushed hard on the growth front, opening 72 new restaurants. That's probably too fast, so it is appropriate that management is only planning on 48 to 52 new locations in 2024.\n\nStill, at that pace, Cava is set for material growth in 2024. If it can come close to those numbers again in 2025 and 2026, which seems like a reasonable goal, the restaurant will add as many as 150 new locations over the next three years. So the business could grow by as much as 50%. That's huge!\n\nThe fly in the ointment for fast-growing restaurants\n\nEach new location will bring with it new revenue, helping to boost the top line. This is something that Wall Street likes to see with young restaurant concepts. Right now, the company has a particularly compelling story to tell, noting that same-store sales growth came in at nearly 18% in 2023. That's an insanely high number and suggests the company's Mediterranean concept is in high demand. For reference, Chipotle's same-store sales totaled just under 8% in 2023.\n\nThis is where investors need to pay extra close attention. It is unlikely that Cava can sustain such rapid same-store sales growth, which effectively measures the performance of stores that have been open for at least a year. The risk of a rapid expansion plan is that new locations start to cannibalize older ones, leading to weak same-store sales growth even as the new locations boost the overall top line.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt isn't uncommon for Wall Street to push young restaurants so hard for growth that they stop paying as much attention to the core business. They just become new store machines.\n\nSo, as Cava grows its stores and business over the next three years, investors need to focus on same-store sales. This will help you determine if the growth is broad based or if new locations are benefiting at the expense of older ones. If the latter is the case Cava is destined for trouble.\n\nThe Chipotle comparison is probably a good one here, with a reasonable target for Cava's same-store growth being something similar to what its larger peer puts up.\n\nBigger isn't always better\n\nCava is likely to be a bigger company in three years, perhaps materially so. But that doesn't mean it will be a better company. As an investor, you need to watch the top line and the store count. But don't forget to monitor same-store sales, as well. That's going to be a key determinant of whether or not Cava's growth is truly sustainable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Chipotle, Check Out This Up-and-Coming Fast Casual Restaurant Entrant",
        "content": "In the bustling fast-casual dining sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has set a strong benchmark for measuring success and innovation. Meanwhile, Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) continues to carve out a niche and challenge established norms with its dynamic and health-oriented approach.\n\nLet's look deeper into Cava's business model, growth strategies, and potential as a smart long-term investment by putting it head-to-head against the industry leader.\n\nCava's strategic menu design appeals to health-conscious diners\n\nCava's menu, infused with vibrant Mediterranean flavors, appears meticulously crafted to match the modern diner's desire for delicious and nutritious options. With protein-rich grains and a variety of fresh dips and abundant vegetable choices, the chain's offerings aim to delight the taste buds while simplifying healthy eating habits.\n\nThat strategic approach to menu diversification continues to play a pivotal role in Cava's financial success, as evidenced by an impressive annual revenue surge to $717.1 million in 2023, representing a remarkable 59.8% increase over the previous year. By focusing on health-conscious, customizable meals, the company is directly responding to the growing consumer demand for dietary awareness and flexibility in meal options. While Chipotle also makes the customer king with customization, its menu flexibility falls short of Cava's options.\n\nCava's substantial revenue growth demonstrates its effective market penetration and underscores its operational excellence, indicating a scalable and replicable business model. These factors also signal a resilient enterprise ready to thrive in diverse markets. That positions Cava stock as a potentially lucrative long-term opportunity, one you could hold for at least three to five years to grow your investment alongside the company.\n\nThere's also some obvious room for growth when Cava goes head-to-head with Chipotle. Last year's USA Today Readers' Choice Awards gave the fast-casual Mexican chain a top-three slot. Cava placed 7th in the same category of best restaurants for quick, healthy food. Just making the top 10 is a big win, though.\n\nHow Cava's digital innovations enhance customer experience\n\nLike Chipotle, Cava embraces technology to improve how customers interact with its brand. In 2023, digital sales accounted for 36% of its total revenue, thanks to online ordering and a mobile app. The company's CEO seeks to create a \"multi-channel business,\" focusing on success capturing both walk-ins and online orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing digital sales isn't just about keeping up with trends; it shows Cava's ability to adapt to what customers want and stay competitive. These moves show the chain has what it takes to make more money and stand out in the fast-casual dining world. Both Cava and Chipotle use tech to make things better for customers, and Cava's fully integrated digital system gives it an extra boost. Tech helps Cava save money, serve customers better, and stay ahead of the game.\n\nFinancial insights from Cava's revenue surge and market position\n\nIn 2023, Cava expanded its presence by 30%, adding 72 new locations and aiming for over 1,000 stores by 2032. Alongside this growth in locations, average unit volume (AUV) increased from $2.4 million to $2.6 million. This rise in AUV indicates higher average sales per location, showing that the company's strategies are continuing to improve performance at individual restaurants.\n\nThis growth in AUV is significant for Cava's financial performance and future prospects. It highlights the chain's ability to drive sales and revenue growth through effective strategy and operational execution. Cava's aggressive expansion and operational efficiency showcase its strength in the market, further evidenced by its stellar year-over-year performance.\n\nCava's market niche compared to Chipotle\n\nCava's Mediterranean-inspired menu distinguishes it from Chipotle's Mexican-inspired offerings, allowing Cava to tap into a niche market segment and sidestep the giant. Cava also enjoys an advantage over Chipotle's more conventional menu selections. This strategic differentiation minimizes direct competition with Chipotle, potentially expanding Cava's market share.\n\nCava's focused culinary approach also shields it from some of the intense competitive pressures faced by larger chains. By innovating within the realm of Mediterranean cuisine, Cava creates a buffer against economic fluctuations and shifts in consumer preferences, enhancing its market stability over the long term.\n\nAs it scales, Cava faces the challenge of maintaining its distinctive brand identity and high standards of quality and service. The fast-casual market remains notoriously competitive. Cava must innovate continuously in its menu offerings as well as its marketing strategies and customer engagement techniques to stay ahead in the evolving landscape of dining preferences.\n\nIs investing in Cava a worthy choice?\n\nInvesting in Cava presents a promising opportunity for portfolio diversification. With its solid financial foundation, strategic plans, and unique niche, Cava appears ready for substantial growth. The brand's proactive expansion strategy, along with its emphasis on digital integration and adaptability to emerging trends, make it an enticing investment choice with significant long-term potential.\n\nWhile investors probably won't forget Chipotle, especially not with a market cap 10 times larger than that of the newcomer, there's ample room for multiple contenders in the fast-casual market, and plenty of compelling reasons to consider investing in both.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "There\u2019s plenty out there that could potentially drive a broad market pullback, but there are also plenty of individual stocks due for a pullback. Irrespective how the market performs from here, these types of stocks may be in for considerable declines in price.\n\nSeveral of the stocks that have thus far this year been top-performers fit into this category. While in some cases, big run-ups have been justified, there are plenty that can be deemed as situations where shares have moved up \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, just because investors have gone overboard about a certain stock, doesn\u2019t mean the market will soon come to its senses. Just ask the bears who have lost billions betting against Carvana (NYSE:CVNA).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, don\u2019t assume high-flier resiliency is universal. In the case of the following seven stocks due for a pullback, there are identifiable factors that strongly suggest a reversal lies ahead for each one.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava Group (NYSE:CAVA) bolted higher after its June 2023 IPO, but slid lower throughout the rest of last year. This year, however, it\u2019s been a different story. Shares in this Mediterranean restaurant chain have been on a tear.\n\nSince January, CAVA stock is up 43%, making it one of this year\u2019s top performing stocks. Chalk up this rally to beat-and-raise quarterly results and an analyst upgrade. Yet while the bulls may be betting that Cava is the next big restaurant growth story, this possibility has become overly priced-in.\n\nCAVA now trades for a staggering 257.2 times forward earnings. Yes, this valuation could be sustainable in the short-term, if sentiment holds. However, with short-interest at fairly moderate levels (15.7% of float), instead of squeezing higher when the company next reports results sometime next month, shares could move lower on \u201csell the news\u201d profit taking.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buy\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpun off from Exelon (NYSE:EXC) in 2022, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is an independent electricity generation company. Over the past year, CEG shares have zoomed 146.9% higher. Year-to-date alone, CEG is up by 57.3%.\n\nA major factor behind the sudden popularity of CEG stock has to do with the company\u2019s \u201cgreen wave\u201d bona fides. Investors and decision-makers alike have warmed up to the idea of nuclear power\u2019s potential to produce clean energy on a massive scale. Constellation has significant nuclear capacity, so it could strongly benefit from increased demand for zero-emissions nuclear power.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, while some of Constellation\u2019s rally may be justified, it\u2019s possible that the market has gone overboard. Shares now trade at a big premium to other \u201cgreen wave\u201d utilities stocks, like NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). As any subsequent stumble could drive a de-rating, consider CEG one of the top stocks due for a pullback.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nWhile I\u2019ve recently been bullish about Disney (NYSE:DIS), at the same time I wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of a pullback for the media conglomerate\u2019s shares sometime down the road.\n\nDIS stock has bounced back in a big way over the past four months. Year-to-date, shares are up by nearly 25%. Sentiment has improved in a big way, thanks largely to promising developments, including progress in making the company\u2019s streaming segment profitable. Nevertheless, after the latest round of enthusiasm, sentiment could soon lean bearish again.\n\nWhy? As Seeking Alpha commentator Value Kicker recently argued, Disney CEO Bob Iger\u2019s cost-focused turnaround strategy will only go so far. If the company fails to get back into growth mode, after running out of fat to trim from its cost structure, shares could pull back in a big way. DIS trades at a massive premium to other \u201cbig media\u201d stocks.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) A large General Electric (GE) sign.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, General Electric (NYSE:GE) completed its final spin-off. The former industrial conglomerate has now transformed into an aerospace pure play. Investors have been pleased with this transformation.\n\nGE stock has nearly doubled in the past year. Year-to-date, shares are up by more than 50%. However, with this catalyst now played out, GE may now be one of the stocks due for a pullback. Yes, it\u2019s not only been the restructuring that has made the market bullish about General Electric.\n\nThere is also great optimism about future aircraft component demand. Still, it\u2019s very possible investors are overestimating this potential growth catalyst. Shares today trade for 39 times forward earnings. Possibly now \u201cpriced for perfection,\u201d any sort of earnings hiccup or slip-up may lead to a severe correction for the stock. Even as momentum remains on its side, err on the side of caution, and sell GE now.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAs you may know, Eli Lilly\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) continued hot run has been driven by the pharma firm\u2019s recently-launched diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nAnticipating that off-the-charts demand for these products will keep on moving the needle for the company\u2019s profitability and sales, LLY stock has kept on cruising to loftier price levels over the past years. Shares have doubled over the past twelve months, and are up nearly 28% year-to-date.\n\nHowever, while the initial phase of the rally may have been justified, the market has arguably gone too far. LLY now trades for 60.2 times forward earnings. Even when taking into account the fact that earnings could nearly double between now and 2026, the Mounjaro/Zepbound upside is clearly accounted for, and then some. With this in mind, if you already own LLY, take profit now, before it\u2019s too late. Otherwise, hold off buying.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another name that I\u2019m bullish on, but concede that it may be one of the stocks due for a pullback. Shares in the Facebook and Instagram parent have been on a hot run since 2023, and this winning streak has continued into 2024.\n\nYear-to-date, META stock is up by 41.8%. Yet while the social media giant has impressed the market with its cost-cutting and AI implementation success, as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently argued, the stock could soon experience a post-earnings correction.\n\nEven if the company manages to beat already-high expectations, too many investors may decide to make the earnings release their time to make an exit. Macro worries could also knock down META in the near-term. That\u2019s not to say you need to stay away completely. However, if you\u2019ve been thinking about buying META, there\u2019s no reason to rush.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) app open on a phone screen\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of this writing, a sell-off for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) may be starting to take shape. That is, following the company release of its latest quarterly results post-market on April 18, NFLX has pulled back. Until now, NFLX, up 25.4% year-to-date, had been trending up.\n\nThe video streaming powerhouse beat Wall Street forecasts for the quarter. Subscriber numbers were also solid. Alas, NFLX stock still sold off, as the market focused on the major negative with the earnings release: the latest updates to guidance. These suggested that the company\u2019s rate of growth is coming up short of analyst expectations.\n\nInvestors may be willing to price growth stories at high earnings multiples, yet if evidence emerges that this high growth is slowing down, the market typically reacts accordingly. In the case of NFLX, this may mean a continued re-rating to the downside, as investors and analysts walk back expectations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Cava Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) operates Mediterranean-style fast-casual restaurants primarily in the East Coast and Southern regions of the United States. They operate over 300 locations under two brand names, CAVA and Zoe's Kitchen, which it acquired in 2018. Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?\n\nSource: 2023 annual investor presentation\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with T.\n\nThe stock performance recently has been outstanding, rising almost 50% so far this year. Compared to small caps and the restaurant industry being relatively flat for the year, Cava Group has been a darling in an underperforming sector. Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?\n\nCAVA Data by GuruFocus\n\nThis all sounds wonderfulexcept some investors have sold a significant amount of their stake in the company over the past few months. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly warrants a closer look.\n\nWho is jumping ship?\n\nTwo major investors are responsible for almost all of the selling.\n\nRon Shaich is chairman of the board of directors for Cava Group and sold 1.50 million shares in March. This dropped his share count from 11.60 million to just over 10.10 million (13% drop in ownership). Artal International S.C.A. is an investment firm based in Luxembourg. It has sold 5.50 million shares so far in 2024. This dropped its share count from 32 million to 26.50 million (17% drop in ownership). Even after the selling, Artal owns over 20% of CAVA Group and has two members on the board of directors. Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?\n\nSource: Insider page on GuruFocus\n\nThat is a lot of shares being sold. Regardless, it is important to note this type of selling is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nLarge investors might sell their positions to make a large purchase or rebalance their investment portfolio rather than because of a pessimistic outlook on the company. It should also be noted that Cava Group first started trading less than a year ago and this could be one of the first opportunities for investors to divest some of their shares.\n\nIs there reason for alarm?\n\nEven though these investors still hold a large position in CAVA Group, it is important to do our due diligence to make sure it is still a good investment.\n\nCAVA Group had its initial public offering in June 2023, which means doing historical comparisons is not going to be a viable way to value the stock. Instead, we need to look at the current valuation as well as potential growth in the future.\n\nKey Statistics (as of: 4/12/2024) CAVA Group Restaurant Industry Median P/E 1,063 23.5 P/B 12.7 2.8 Net Margin 1.2 2.4 ROE 11.4 8.3 Debt/Equity 0.6 0.94\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe return on equity and debt-equity numbers look pretty good compared to peers, but the valuation ratios really jump out as a red flag. A price-earnings ratio of just over 1,000 is astronomical. Does this mean Cava Group is overvalued?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is not that simple. The company not only went public in 2023, but also recorded its first profit in the same year. With earnings per share of just 6 cents and a recent IPO, it should not be too surprising to get some wonky valuation numbers.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nIt is always important to look at the future prospects of a company. CAVA Group is looking to grow fast. At the end of 2023, it had over 300 restaurants, but is looking to grow its number of locations by at least 15% per year until it reaches over 1,000 in 2032. That is significant growth, and the company has the room to do it.\n\nCAVA Group's largest competitor is Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG), which operates over 3,000 restaurants across the United States. It has a huge part of the market share and Cava Group has an opportunity to chip away to grow the company.\n\nAnother place that Cava Group really stands out is same-restaurant sales growth. This measures the sales growth in existing restaurants and thus excludes sales growth derived from opening new locations.\n\nSame-Restaurant Sales Growth Rate 2023 2022 CAVA Group 17.9 14.2 Chipotle Mexican Grill 7.9 8.0 Industry Average 1.7 5.9\n\nSource: Annual reports, Industry average from Restaurant Business\n\nCava Group is way ahead of Chipotle as well as the overall industry. Even with the industry growth slowing in 2023, the company's same-restaurant sales growth is accelerating.\n\nOne can see the restaurant's two-pronged approach to growth. On one side, it will be opening new restaurants at a very fast pace over the next decade. On the other side, it has double-digit revenue growth in its existing stores. Combined, this strategy led to 30% growth in revenue in 2023.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs an investor, it can be difficult to balance data that tells two different stories. The valuation metrics for Cava Group are significantly worse than its peer competitors, but its growth prospects are phenomenal. What to do?\n\nIn this situation, it makes sense to circle back to the large investors discussed earlier. Artal and Shaich sold a combined 7 million shares so far this year, but they still have a significant ownership stake in Cava Group (over 35 million shares combined). With a recent, large run-up in price, their selling appears to be rebalancing and taking profits rather than running for the hills.\n\nInvestors should consider the same strategy. Taking some profits while valuation ratios are high is a great way to lessen your exposure to a potentially overvalued stock, but still have an opportunity for additional gains if the company is able to execute its growth strategy. If the stock falls, you will be pleased you sold some, but if the stock rises, you will be happy to gain more profits. Either way, it is a smart idea to follow what these large investors are doing.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Restaurant Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential",
        "content": "The restaurant industry is massive but highly competitive. As a result, plenty of restaurant stocks have fizzled out, but the industry has also produced some big winners. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), for example, is more than a 50-bagger from its 2006 initial public offering (IPO).\n\nAfter a number of disappointments in the restaurant industry in the 2010s, investor expectations seem to have been reset, and that has set up two restaurant stocks for big potential gains. Let's take a closer look at them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Cava Group\n\nPlenty of restaurant stocks have been dubbed the next Chipotle. Those have mostly disappointed, but Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) actually looks like the real deal.\n\nCava is a fast-casual chain focused on Mediterranean food, and its menu and decor closely resemble Chipotle. It offers rolled-up pita sandwiches that look like burritos, along with bowls, and its restaurants have the same industrial minimalist aesthetic that Chipotle is known for at its locations.\n\nBut it's not just the food that's reminiscent of Chipotle. Cava, which went public last June, also has the numbers to match. The company saw revenue jump 52.5% to $175.5 million in the fourth quarter, driven by rapid expansion and a same-store sales jump of 11.4% in the quarter. This shows that customers are returning frequently, a promising sign for the brand.\n\nCava also has a strong restaurant-level profit margin, at 22.4% in Q4 and more than 24% for the full year, not far behind Chipotle. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company is profitable, reporting a $2 million net income in Q4 as it's spending aggressively to grow the business.\n\nThe company also has backing from one of the most successful people in fast-casual history. Ron Shaich, the founder of Panera, is currently the Chairman of Cava, and was an early investor, recognizing the opportunity the company had.\n\nFinally, Cava shares also look reasonably valued, especially as the restaurant chain has a huge growth opportunity in front of it, finishing 2023 with 309 restaurants. The stock currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 5.4, a similar valuation to Chipotle. If Cava can maintain its current momentum, the stock has a lot of room for growth ahead of it.\n\n2. Sweetgreen\n\nLike Cava, Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG) is a fast-growing fast-casual stock, but it's still down substantially from the peak it reached after its IPO in 2021. Sweetgreen is the leader in the fast-casual salad niche. Its restaurants generate average unit volumes of $2.9 billion, on par with Chipotle, showing that the brand is popular.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has not yet reached profitability. It posted an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $1.8 million on $153 million in revenue.\n\nSweetgreen is also expanding quickly, with revenue up 29% on 6% same-store sales growth in Q4, but it has a unique asset up its sleeve that could drive significant growth over the coming years.\n\nThe company has developed an automated platform it calls the Infinite Kitchen. This is essentially a salad-making robot, and it's introduced the concept to two restaurants so far. The Infinite Kitchen has accelerated the company's throughput and saved on labor costs.\n\nSweetgreen is planning to accelerate the rollout of its Infinite Kitchen this year, adding it to seven new restaurants, and converting three to four large restaurants to Infinite Kitchens. The restaurant chain has also proven it has a popular menu and restaurant concept.\n\nBut the business fundamentals could use some improvement. Adding Infinite Kitchens could help differentiate from other restaurant chains, improve its customer service by speeding up throughput, and drive profitability as it saves the company on labor costs and increases revenue.\n\nWith just over 220 restaurants currently, Sweetgreen has a lot of room for growth both as a business and as a stock. At a price-to-sales ratio of 4, the shares have plenty of upside potential if the company can take steps toward profitability.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sweetgreen right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sweetgreen, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sweetgreen wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.\n\nJim Cramer said during his program on April 17 that we would need to see at least two months of \"cooling numbers\" before the Fed even considers to start cutting interest rates. He said many investors have been \"clinging\" to rate cut hopes but the economic activity, jobs market, M&A and IPO activity remains hot, giving the Fed no impetus to ease its monetary policy.\n\nCramer lamented that the market is \"ignoring\" the positives and instead continues to react to weak earnings reports posted by some companies including JB Hun and Prologis. \u00a0Jim Cramer added that while he would \"never ever fight\" his viewers who want to sell their stocks right now amid the current market pullback and declines, selling stocks when they are low is not his \"style.\"\n\nCramer said that some \"big picture negatives\" were also weighing the market down. The CNBC host said long-term interest rates were rising, commodity and oil prices were soaring before seeing a decline recently amid hopes that Israel won't react to Iran's missile attacks. However, Cramer said these \"green shoots\" are crushed by the bear quickly, leaving no room for positivity.\n\nA Market That \"Wants to Go Down\"\n\nJim Cramer said that this is a \"market that wants to go down\" and since major stocks like Apple and Tesla are no longer giving a push to the broader market like they did in the recent market, people might think it would make sense to sell out. But Cramer questioned the temptation to immediately sell out of the current market, saying it's never a good idea to sell everything at once.\n\nCramer's Charitable Trust is Selling Stocks\n\nJim Cramer revealed that his charitable trust kept selling stocks \"every day in the last four weeks.\" But Cramer said he didn\u2019t sell his stocks on a decline. Instead, his charitable trust used a strategy called \"scaling out.\"\n\n\"As the stock went higher we sold some shares to raise some cash. If it ever comes back down we can always use that cash to scale back in.\"\n\nThe Fed Might Have \"Jumped the Gun\" Again\n\nCramer said he thinks the market might be seeing a \"short-term peak\" because the Fed might have \"jumped the gun\" even after indicating earlier in the year that there won't be any need for more rate hikes.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer Said He'd Keep Buying Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nCramer sounded agitated on Abbot's pullback despite posting a quarter that according to Cramer was \"terrific.\" Cramer said when he saw Abbot's stock getting \"annihilated\" despite strong numbers, he knew that market has gone \"too negative.\" Cramer said he bought more Abbot shares on the latest decline. ABT is one of the stocks Cramer is recommending in April. Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Some top stocks both hedge funds and Cramer love include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer said during his program on April 4 that he likes HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK). Cramer said he had recommended the stock before and it \u201cshot up\u201d before coming down. Cramer said he\u2019s surprised to see the stock price of HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK) so low given the skyrocketing oil price.\n\n\u201cI want you to buy High Peak, right here!\u201d Cramer said.\n\nWasatch Micro Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe also added\u00a0HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK), an exploration & production (E&P) company that performs geological and geophysical services, petroleum engineering and drilling. HighPeak is focused on developing unconventional oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Midland Basin of Texas. We like that the company\u2019s energy reserves contain fewer byproducts than typically found in the reserves of competitors. Prior to our purchase, the stock was down because HighPeak had taken on too much debt. Under the leadership of Jack Hightower, the new chairman and CEO, the company has raised equity\u2014largely from the management team\u2014and has refinanced the debt. Going forward, we think HighPeak is attractive as an independent company or as an acquisition target of a larger competitor. Our confidence in HighPeak is enhanced by Mr. Hightower\u2019s track record of success in the E&P industry and his willingness to put his own money where his mouth is.\u201d\n\n9. Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts about Texas-based Viper Energy Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:VNOM). He said Viper Energy Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:VNOM)\u00a0is a \u201cgood stock\u201d and praised the company\u2019s dividend yield. Cramer also said that Viper Energy Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:VNOM)\u00a0has got mineral rights which make it a suitable play in the current environment since according to Cramer we are in an \u201cinflationary environment\u201d when it comes to oil and minerals.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got a good one,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 17 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Viper Energy Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:VNOM).\n\nViper talked about guidance and other important updates during its earnings call in February:\n\n\"Our GRP acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter, clearly laid out the framework that we look for in large-scale M&A. First, it must be accretive on all relevant financial measures. Second, there must be high-quality, undeveloped inventory that supports our long-term growth profile and provides clear visibility to future development. And third, the acquisition must provide significant scale that results in a pro forma business that is both bigger and better. Separately, Viper also completed its conversion into a Delaware corporation during the fourth quarter. We believe this conversion has delivered increased governance rights for our shareholders and positions Viper to grow our business and fully highlight the advantaged nature of mineral and royalty ownership.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we\u2019ve initiated production guidance for both Q1 and the full year. While Q1 is expected to the weakest quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the timing of large pads, we continue to see strong activity levels across our acreage position and expect significant growth to occur throughout the year with 20 \u2014 with Q4 2024 production expected to be at or above the high end of our guidance range. This continued production growth, along with our best-in-class cost structure, should enable Viper to continue to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders primarily through our base plus variable dividend.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer called CAVA Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CAVA)\u00a0a \u201cvery strong stock\u201d in a latest program on CNBC. He said \u201cI love this\u201d stock and recommended existing CAVA Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CAVA)\u00a0investors to \u201cstay long.\u201d For those who don\u2019t own the restaurant chain company stock, Cramer\u2019s advice is to \u201cconsider\u201d the stock.\n\nIn addition to CAVA, Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n7. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nEarlier in April, Jim Cramer called Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\u00a0\u00a0has been a \u201chorrendous\u201d stock but said that it\u2019s \u201cabout to go up.\u201d Cramer said while input costs in the chicken industry are doing down, we are \u201cabout to have a chicken price explosion.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why doesn\u2019t he like Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) when its margins are going up, Cramer reiterated that he\u2019s actually recommending people to buy the stock; he just wants Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\u00a0\u00a0to lower chicken prices.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 29 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tyson Foods Inc\u00a0(NYSE:TSN)\u00a0.\n\nCiting expected profits from chicken and pork segment, Citi recently hiked its price target for Tyson Foods Inc\u00a0(NYSE:TSN)\u00a0\u00a0to $62.\n\nJim Cramer also recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for long term.\n\n6. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nSolar energy tracking and optimization solutions company Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) is one of the latest stock recommendations of Jim Cramer. A questioner asked Cramer about a recent analyst downgrade for Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT). Cramer said that he \u201cread that downgrade\u201d and believes it was just \u201csomeone trying to create a little noise.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer thinks Nextracker Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NXT) \u201cstory\u201d is good and said he\u2019d be a buyer of the stock \u201cright here at $52\u201d. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) shares have pulled back since and as of April 15 morning the stock was trading at around $47.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Wayfair (W) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.34 a share 17 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 2, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the -$0.34 Most Accurate Estimate and the -$0.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Wayfair has an Earnings ESP of 25.94%.\n\nW is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Cava Group (CAVA) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nCava Group, which is readying to report earnings on May 27, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.05 a share, and CAVA is 42 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nFor Cava Group, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.02 is 118.75%.\n\nW and CAVA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "With A 2.3% Return On Equity, Is CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) A Quality Stock?",
        "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for CAVA Group\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CAVA Group is:\n\n2.3% = US$13m \u00f7 US$571m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.02 in profit.\n\nDoes CAVA Group Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see CAVA Group has a lower ROE than the average (17%) in the Hospitality industry classification. roe\n\nThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for CAVA Group by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCAVA Group's Debt And Its 2.3% ROE\n\nOne positive for shareholders is that CAVA Group does not have any net debt! So while I find its ROE to be rather low, at least it didn't use debt. After all, with cash on the balance sheet, a company has a lot more optionality in good times and bad.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Let's look at fast-growing companies that are on the verge of turning healthy profits and could deliver massive gains for shareholders over the next decade and beyond.\n\n1. DraftKings\n\nOne way to find long-term winners is to identify companies that are benefiting from technological advancements. The online sports betting market is expected to reach $65 billion over the next five years, and DraftKings' (NASDAQ: DKNG) first-mover advantage in launching on mobile devices years ago has made it the runaway leader in this market.\n\nDraftKings commands over 30% share of the market in North America, and it continues to win more customers. It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, rising 44% over the year-ago period.\n\nWhat's also notable about DraftKings' performance is the growth in spending per customer. Average revenue per monthly unique payer was $116 in Q4, up 6% year over year, and almost double the same quarter three years ago.\n\nIt's clear DraftKings can continue to grow revenue from existing customers in states that have already legalized online sports betting. The addressable market in states where the company is already operating is expected to grow from $20 billion to $30 billion by 2028.\n\nMore states are expected to legalize sports betting, which should justify the stock's expensive valuation. However, if DraftKings successfully expands into new markets like the lottery, where it recently announced the acquisition of leading lottery operator Jackpocket, it could turn the stock into a monster winner for investors over the next decade.\n\n2. Cava Group\n\nCava Group(NYSE: CAVA) is filling out a huge opportunity in the Mediterranean fast-casual dining market. It ended 2023 with 309 restaurants generating $177 million in quarterly revenue. Its rate of growth and a strategy emphasizing consistency and profitability should make the stock a great investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nCava capped off 2023 by reporting same-restaurant sales growth of nearly 18% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong traffic trends. There is clearly a high demand for this type of cuisine in the fast-casual market.\n\nImportantly, Cava is following a profitable store-opening model. For the full year, it reported a net profit of $13.3 million, a significant improvement over the loss in fiscal 2022. Investors should expect strong earnings growth over the long term, given the company's healthy restaurant-level profit margin.\n\nLack of consistency and execution can destroy shareholder returns in restaurant stocks, but Cava has its eye on the ball. Management mentioned on its last earnings call that it is investing in artificial intelligence to make its restaurants easier to operate. It's also working on fine-tuning its loyalty programs to encourage more frequent traffic and improving training to deliver a consistent experience at every location.\n\nCava is clearly having success, but its current restaurant footprint is a fraction of more established chains. As it opens more restaurants, the business should deliver profitable growth that fuels big gains for patient shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in DraftKings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DraftKings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Q&amp;A: Chipotle CEO dishes on big portion sizes, AI, and top leadership advice",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nJust passing the six-year mark in his run as Chipotle's (CMG) CEO, Brian Niccol is still juggling full plates.\n\nOn his mind: robots that cut, core, and peel avocados; a coming commencement speech at his alma mater; and how many restaurants he's opening in the years ahead.\n\nAll in the day of a CEO who has flown a little under the radar in the press, but not with his investor base. This week, the company announced a 50-for-one stock split, making its shares more accessible as the stock trades around all-time highs.\n\n\"I think Chipotle is going to achieve things that we set out in vision statements and now we're making reality \u2014 so the next few years are going to be a lot of fun,\" Niccol tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nIt's been a fun few decades for Niccol, who got his feet wet at Procter & Gamble (PG)'s branding department in the mid-1990s. Then a recent college graduate, one of his first assignments was working on P&G's Scope Mouthwash account and reportedly breaking new ground by sending an animated kiss via email.\n\nFast-forward, and Niccol was leading marketing at Yum! Brands (YUM) owned Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, where he created Taco Bell's famed \"Live M\u00e1s\" branding. He went on to become its CEO, his last role before accepting the Chipotle gig. Brian Niccol speaks during an interview at the Associated Press in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe soft-spoken fast food veteran started as Chipotle's CEO on March 5, 2018, with two strategic imperatives. First, stabilize a business financially rocked by an E.Coli outbreak. Second, relaunch the brand amid a shift to digital ordering.\n\nThen, another priority as the COVID-19 pandemic hit: Retrain workers and continue to promote from within, long the hallmark of Chipotle.\n\nSince then, Niccol has checked every box and more. He ushered in new menu items such as cauliflower rice and quesadillas, and tested robots that make tortilla chips. He boosted Chipotle's presence to 3,400 locations (including an entry into Canada), up from 2,400 around the time he was hired.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chain could hit 7,000 restaurants or more in the US over the next decade, says Niccol, who's aiming for a record of 285 to 315 new openings in 2024.\n\nChipotle shares have skyrocketed 556% since Niccol was announced as CEO, per Yahoo Finance data, compared to 89% for the S&P 500 and 79% for McDonald's (MCD).\n\nTo further put this into perspective, Apple's (AAPL) stock price is up 275% during that time span, while Amazon (AMZN) has gained about 119%.\n\n\"Chipotle remains a premium brand with strong value and digital capabilities that have positioned Co better than most as evidenced in recent traffic trends,\" Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said in a recent client note.\n\nThe below conversation with Niccol has been condensed for length and clarity.\n\nBrian Sozzi: Through the inflationary period seen in recent years for fast food, people have still seemed to have a love affair with Chipotle the brand. Why?\n\nBrian Niccol: The mission that we have is \"Food with Integrity.\" And what does that mean? Well, it means clean food. It means food that's raised the right way. It means it's food that's cooked and prepared the right way.\n\n[Customers will] talk about how big the portions are with the burritos or the bowls that they build, but when you really boil it down, it is this commitment to Food with Integrity and the [cooking] that actually happens in our restaurants. It's all fresh food done right in front of you, and people are turned on by that, and the fact that we can get it done highly customized and highly fast, it's just meaningful bonus points.\n\nSozzi: It's really just the large portion size, come on.\n\nNiccol: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head, Brian. The customization so that you can get the bowl or the burrito the way you want \u2014 it is hugely valuable. If you want double meat, we'll do that for you. If you want a little extra rice, we'll do that for you. At the end of the day, however you want to eat, you ultimately feel good about what you're putting in your body. And I think that matters a lot to every generation and every income cohort out there.\n\nSozzi: How is AI and new automation technology going to change Chipotle's future? A new JP Morgan report said you were testing cameras that will help measure portion sizes so they are accurate; tell us more.\n\nNiccol: I think there's definitely a future where we can be a lot more accurate in giving people consistent portion sizes, whether it's double guac on the side or in your bowl. And the reality is between vision, technology, and AI, I think we're going to be able to become a lot more accurate, without having to give up any speed in doing it. That's what I'm most excited about.\n\nSozzi: Is this the year where you test new vision technology in restaurants to improve order accuracy?\n\nNiccol: We have not yet, but I'm optimistic that this is the year where we're going to do one or two of these things at least in a restaurant. And the thing that I'm really excited about is even the next generation [of this technology] that we're already working on.\n\nAnd then when you get your crew members involved, you put it under the pressure of hundreds of transactions, you just learn so much. I think even on our Autocado [avocado peeling robots], we're already on like our third or fourth prototype, and now we're like okay, this is ready to go into a restaurant. I'm sure when we put it in the restaurant, we'll learn something that might cause us to iterate one more time.\n\nPart of the process of this too is you've got to be comfortable with failing. Chippy [tortilla chip-making robot] didn't pan out the way we thought it would. Because of Chippy we ended up a lot better on Autocado. I'm committed to being a learning organization.\n\nSozzi: What went wrong with the Chippy robot testing?\n\nNiccol: The biggest challenge was the cleaning of it. It just became way too cumbersome for the team to clean it. We took that learning for Autocado. Much earlier in the design we have to take into account what's going to take for the crew member to clean this thing. The time is nearing where a machine could cut, core and peel avocados at Chipotle restaurants. (Chipotle)\n\nSozzi: The Chipotle lines in the restaurant feel like they are moving faster at long last. Why?\n\nNiccol: [It] is just from getting back to executing on Chipotle standards. We had to really shake off some of the behaviors that were created during the labor shortage in COVID. Where we were dealt really difficult situations that caused them to close the restaurant early or be out of ingredients or be understaffed.\n\nAnd all that stuff now is behind us. We're staffed now and trained for deploying, and the teams have more stability than they've had in the last couple of years.\n\nSozzi: Not many restaurant chains are opening 300 locations this year as you all are. In 10 years, how many Chipotles are open worldwide?\n\nNiccol: Well, we've publicly said we want at least to get to 7,000. I think the good news is as we continue to open restaurants we see no slowing down in new unit economics, which will give us more and more confidence that 7,000 might be too conservative of a number.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the US. So, Canada is performing well, every region in the United States is performing well, and we're early days in Europe, and we're going to start exploring how this brand can work and travel outside the United States. But it's early days there.\n\nSozzi: Can Chipotle work in China?\n\nNiccol: That's a great question. I don't know the answer to that yet. My instincts tell me yes. But we have a long way to go to prove that out ... The good news is, we've got the US business growing in a really special way that affords us the opportunity to go learn in a lot of different parts of the world.\n\nSozzi: Chipotle continues to place a lot of emphasis on promoting people from within to higher-level positions and offering perks like college assistance to strengthen the culture. How much do you think about culture each day?\n\nNiccol: It's hugely important. People want to be a part of a winning culture, a caring culture, a growing culture. And one of my key jobs is how do I make sure I've got the right leaders that cascade that type of culture.\n\nSozzi: How do you stay sharp as a leader?\n\nNiccol: I'm always trying to figure out what I could learn next. I'm still really curious. I like what I do. So that gets me energized. And it's fun when you're a part of growing something. The idea that we have so much opportunity to grow, and the fact that I still consider myself young, I still have so much I personally think I could impact and grow myself.\n\nSozzi: So where do you see yourself in 10 years? You are still a young guy as you mentioned.\n\nNiccol: It's funny, I've got three kids and my youngest, she's still in middle school. I want obviously Chipotle to achieve everything that we've set out to do. But I also know it's important for me and my wife Jen to see our kids turn into good folks. And, hopefully over the next 10 years, that's what we see happen with our kids. I want to see them turn into brave young adults. And at the same time, I think Chipotle is going to achieve things that we set out in vision statements and now we're making [them] reality. Brian Niccol quote\n\nSozzi: I hear you are giving a commencement speech in May to your alma mater Miami University. What's your message going to be to those graduating?\n\nNiccol: It's funny, I'm working on that right now. People that are committed to getting things done, guess what, they get things done. And then unexpected things happen. Unexpected doors open, unexpected opportunities open. And when you walk through those things with an attitude of I'm going to get it done, things happen.\n\nYou've got to do it with high integrity, you've got to do it with high resilience, because not everything's going to go the way you think. I think we live in one of the best places in the world to take advantage of that. So, I think that's the biggest thing that people need to remember is don't be afraid to be a doer.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "3 Incredible Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket This Year",
        "content": "You don't need to chase the latest hot trend in technology to make lots of money in stocks. Buying shares of emerging consumer brands before they are widely recognized is one of the best investment strategies -- ask Peter Lynch.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors were asked to come up with three promising long-term investments that also have near-term upside potential. Here's why Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), and Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS) made the cut.\n\nThe latest fast-casual star\n\nJeremy Bowman (Cava Group): Cava Group is one of the more intriguing IPOs to come on the market recently. It's a fast-casual chain that's drawn comparisons to Chipotle Mexican Grill for good reason.\n\nCava offers a similar menu to Chipotle, using Mediterranean cuisine instead of Mexican. It serves rolled-up pita wraps that closely resemble burritos, and it also offers bowls. Even its restaurant design resembles Chipotle's with a minimalist industrial decor.\n\nCava's financial results have also been impressive in its brief period as a publicly traded company. In its fourth-quarter earnings report, the company reported a 52.5% increase in revenue to $175.5 million, driven by an 11.4% increase in same-store sales and aggressive store openings, as its store base increased 30% to 309.\n\nOther data points show its restaurants are also popular as average unit volumes, or the average annual revenue from its restaurants, was $2.6 million. That is stronger than most of its peers, and the double-digit comparable sales growth shows that number is rapidly moving higher.\n\nOn a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company is minimally profitable. However, its restaurant-level profit margins are strong at 24.8% for 2023, indicating that GAAP profit margins should ramp up as the company expands and its corporate costs moderate.\n\nCava also has a strong management pedigree, with Panera Founder Ron Shaich serving as its chairman and one of its early investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has already soared this year, up nearly 70%, but it looks like a good bet to keep climbing as its valuation is still reasonable, and its results have easily beaten estimates so far. Investors seem to be recognizing Cava's long-term growth potential, and the stock should keep gaining as the company executes its growth plan.\n\nOne of the biggest opportunities in e-commerce\n\nJennifer Saibil (MercadoLibre): E-commerce continues to increase as a percentage of overall retail sales, and that shift has retailers of all stripes moving over their operations to meet demand. Some companies have a headstart, and that edge will provide years of growing revenue. E-commerce accounted for 19% of global retail sales in 2023, but it's expected to reach 24% by 2027. That still leaves years of room to grow.\n\nMercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce powerhouse in Latin America, serving 85 million customers in 18 countries, with 413 items sold in the 2023 fourth quarter alone. That was a 29% year-over-year increase, and MercadoLibre demonstrates robust growth consistently. Revenue increased 83% over last year (currency neutral) in the fourth quarter, a continuing acceleration.\n\nAlmost 50% of shipments are now on the MercadoLibre logistics network, leading to improved delivery times for more orders. More than 75% of shipments were delivered within 48 hours, which might be the fastest e-commerce times anywhere. As MercadoLibre gets products to customers faster, it wins their loyalty and their business, resulting in higher revenue and market share. It also filters down to the bottom line. Net income more than doubled in 2023 to $987 million.\n\nLet's not forget MercadoLibre's fintech business, which is a high-margin business growing even faster than e-commerce and has an even bigger opportunity. Total payment volume (TPV) increased 153% year over year in the fourth quarter to $56 billion, and off-platform TPV was up 182%. As for its credit business, an outgrowth of the fintech business, the total portfolio increased 33% over last year to $3.8 billion. That drives net income as well.\n\nMercadoLibre stock plunged after its fourth-quarter report because earnings per share (EPS) came in below Wall Street's expectations. They took a hit from a one-time tax expense that doesn't impact its operations, and investors may be losing sight of the trees in the forest with the stock dip. But that creates an opportunity for smart investors, and MercadoLibre stock is flashing a huge buy signal right now.\n\nAnother promising restaurant stock\n\nJohn Ballard (Dutch Bros): Finding fast-growing restaurant chains while they are still small can lead to massive returns. A $1,000 investment in Starbucks at its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $273,000 today (excluding dividends). Dutch Bros may not grow into a global brand like Starbucks, but it doesn't have to.\n\nAt just $254 million in quarterly revenue across 16 states, Dutch Bros has a long runway of growth just in the U.S. It's currently at a similar size as Starbucks in the 1990s, and its menu of hot and cold beverages is catching on. Total system same-shop sales increased 5% in the most recent quarter, with total revenue up 26%. It's just a fraction of the size it could grow into over the next few decades. BROS Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nDutch Bros is opening new shops while keeping the business hovering around breakeven. It's been operating at a slight adjusted profit over the last year. But its low profit sets up an important catalyst for the stock.\n\nIts minuscule profit margin could lead to explosive earnings growth over the next decade as it continues to expand beyond its current footprint in 16 states. Dutch Bros earns a solid contribution margin of 26% across its company-operated shops.\n\nDespite continued growth in the business, the stock was a bit expensive at its 2021 IPO, and it subsequently fell in 2022 as same-shop sales slowed over macroeconomic headwinds. But the stock now looks quite attractive at a lower valuation. The share price is up 7% year to date, but improving earnings results this year could send the stock even higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Insiders are Selling These 10 Stocks in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Insiders are Selling These 5 Stocks in 2024.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as the Fed meets this week to decide its future plan of action to tackle inflation, which remains sticky. Overall, the market seems not much worried about the inflation problem as investors are pumping money into equities despite deafening recession warnings from the bears. Bank of America\u2019s Michael Hartnett recently said in a note that US equity funds saw inflows worth $56 billion in the week ending March 13.\n\nWhile Hartnett said the labor market is finally starting to \u201ccrack,\u201d some sections of the market are coming to terms with the possibility of a higher for longer scenario, since consumer spending is still high and the market is not showing signs a slowdown that was expected when rate hikes started\n\n\u201cWe thought we had two feet on the brakes, but maybe we in fact only have one foot on the brakes, and that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen as much of a reduction in demand,\u201d Minneapolis Fed President\u00a0Neel Kashkari\u00a0said, according to a Wall Street Journal report that discussed in detail how the housing market in the US remains resilient despite rate hikes.\n\nBarclays in a latest note tried to explain why exactly the markets keep rallying despite rising inflation and recession worries.\n\nBarclays strategists led by Emmanuel Cau said even after hotter-than-expected inflation reports, investors are still expecting at least three rate cuts from the Fed starting June.\n\n\u201c\u2026investors continue to see the glass half full on the soft landing narrative,\u201d Barclays analysts noted.\n\nBut Barclays said if the Fed decides to take a more \"aggressive\" stance in response to the current resurgence of inflation, the optimistic mood in the market could reverse. Insiders Are Selling These 5 Stocks in 2024\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the stocks insiders are selling. For that we used Insider Monkey's stock screener to first list down all stocks that were sold by corporate insiders over the past two weeks. From these we chose 10 stocks with the highest insider selling activity in terms of dollar value. Some top names in the list include Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR). With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues\n\n10. First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 8\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG) recently saw insider selling activity as two company directors sold 6.9 million shares each on March 12 at $23.99 per share. This insider selling came just a few days after First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG)\u00a0announced an underwritten secondary offering by certain funds managed by Advent International of 6 million common shares.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 hedge funds shows that just eight hedge funds had stakes in the restaurant chain company\u00a0First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG)\u00a0as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The most notable stake in First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG)\u00a0is owned by Michael Pausic\u2019s Foxhaven Asset Management which owns a $21 million stake in First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG).\n\nAve Maria Focused Fund made the following comment about First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe Fund added three new positions in the first half of the year. Two of them are high-growth restaurant chains.\u00a0First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FWRG) is a daytime only concept that operates in the US. The second restaurant, Alsea Group, is owner of the master franchise agreement for Domino\u2019s Pizza in Latin America, as well as Starbucks in Latin America, Spain, and France. Both restaurant groups exhibit strong same-store sales and store-count growth as well as high returns on invested capital.\u201d\n\n9. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nRestaurant chain company CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) ranks ninth in our list of the stocks with recent insider selling activity in 2024. Ronald M. Shaich, chairman of the board of directors of CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA), on March 4 sold 1.5 million shares of CAVA Group Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CAVA)\u00a0at $57.20 per share. Since then the stock has gained by about 10% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company.\n\nIn addition to CAVA, stocks like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) are also on hedge funds' radar.\n\n8. CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCCS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nSeveral directors of CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCCS),\u00a0 sold company shares after the SaaS company priced secondary offering, consisting of 43 million shares, at a price to the public of $11.42 per share. \u00a0Lauren Young, a board director, sold 41,165,139 CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCCS) shares at $11.33 on March 4, when the stock was trading at $11.86. Since then the stock has lost about 0.5%.\n\nArtisan Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCCS) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNotable adds in the quarter included\u00a0CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCCS), Procore Technologies and Smartsheet. CCC Intelligent Solutions is the largest software as a service (SaaS) provider to both the accident claims process for US insurance companies and the US auto repair facilities market. We believe the company\u2019s scale and longevity (founded in 1980) give it knowledge advantages in areas such as expected repair costs, parts availability and repair workflows. Furthermore, as a low-cost provider, the company benefits from insurers\u2019 efforts to drive down repair costs and rental car times. We believe the company will drive growth by continuing to cross-sell and up-sell to its legacy customer base, expand its market share and monetize transactions over its platform. The company reported earnings results that were thesis affirming, and we took advantage of a secondary offering to build this GardenSM position.\u201d\n\n7. Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nOhio-based Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks that are seeing insider selling activity so far in 2024. On March 4, Warburg Pincus & Co., which has a director status at Sotera Health Co's (NASDAQ:SHC)\u00a0board, sold 16,594,363 shares of Sotera Health Co\u00a0(NASDAQ:SHC)\u00a0at $14.31 per share. The stock is down 0.48% since then.\n\nLast month, Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC) announced the launch of a secondary offering of 25 million shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share. These shares were being offered by selling stockholders, which include affiliates of Warburg Pincus and GTCR, as well as two members of management and one member of the Board of Directors of Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC).\n\nStocks that saw insider selling recently also include Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nMcIntyre Partnerships stated the following regarding Sotera Health Company (NASDAQ:SHC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe notable outlier to our \u201cgenerally good\u201d overall portfolio was\u00a0Sotera Health Company (NASDAQ:SHC), where the settlement I was expecting drove shares up by over 100% in January 2023. In response to the outsized move, I reduced the position by roughly half. After its January surge, SHC\u2019s shares have largely been range-bound. Despite the significant gain and lackluster performance since, I believe SHC remains a compelling investment. It is the fund\u2019s largest position, and I go into greater depth below.\n\nAt quarter end, our exposures are 102% long, 6% short, and 96% net. Our five largest positions are SHC, OSW, GTX, record labels, and STHO/SAFE, and account for roughly 80% of assets.\n\nIn a vacuum, SHC screens as my ideal type of business: one half of a duopoly market with good long-term growth where the product sold is mission critical to customers, with high switching costs, yet the product\u2019s cost is immaterial to their customers. In the case of SHC, the company is one of two scaled outsourced providers of medical device and pharmaceutical sterilization services. SHC is diversified across almost all major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, boasts a 100% retention rate with top customers, and has consistently grown sales at close to 10%. Further, sterilization represents ~1% of their customers\u2019 cost of goods sold, and SHC has an ~55% EBITDA margin. Normally, a consistent 10% growth story with 55% margins would trade at a significant multiple. Indeed, from when SHC IPOed in late 2020 until legal fears derailed the stock in fall 2022, shares consistently traded over 18x EV/EBITDA and 25x P/E, yet shares currently trade less than 12x my 2024 EV/EBITDA and 15x my 2024 EPS\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6. Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nAntony Ressler, co-founder and Executive Chairman of Ares Management Corp\u00a0(NYSE:ARES), on March 7 sold three million shares of the alternative investment management company at $130.30 per share. Since then through March 15 the stock has lost about 2.5% in value.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Insiders are Selling These 5 Stocks in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Mid-Cap Stocks with Insider Purchases 13 Best Mining Stocks To Buy Now 11 High Growth Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "If you want to know which growth stocks to sell this month, you\u2019re in the right place. Growth stocks have had a tremendous start to 2024. Between artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, quantum computing and other cutting-edge breakthroughs, this is a promising time for the sector.\n\nEven with all these promising developments, however, that isn\u2019t a green light for all growth stocks. In fact, much of the rally in growth stocks was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates meaningfully in 2024. Instead, the economy remains strong and inflation hasn\u2019t declined as much as anticipated.\n\nBetween high valuations and the potential for the Fed walking back prior support to the market, the growth space could be set for a major correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, not all growth stocks are created equal. In fact, some are quite risky here following their tremendous rallies over the past year. These are seven growth stocks to sell that look especially risky for March 2024 and beyond.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Crowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the epitome of a good company selling at a ridiculous price. While Crowdstrike has a promising business with favorable growth prospects, the market has gotten far too optimistic, setting up inevitable disappointment later this year.\n\nMany software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies traded up to incredibly high price-to-sales ratios in 2021 and then saw their share prices collapse in 2022 as financial gravity kicked in. You might think that investors would learn their lesson from the collapse of these formerly high-flying software firms.\n\nAnd yet, Crowdstrike has recovered all of its 2022 losses. In fact, with a more than 150% rally over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has now reached new all-time highs. This time around, traders are pointing to potential AI benefits in the cybersecurity space. That could well be the case, but it will be a competitive race to deploy AI in cybersecurity and it\u2019s far from assured that Crowdstrike will be the ultimate winner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut with CRWD stock at more than 80 times forward earnings and at nearly 20 times forward revenues, Crowdstrike is priced for perfection. Any slowdown in revenues or disappointment on the AI front could lead the share price to crash.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn paper, it seems like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) should be a tremendous business. The company is a classic marketplace with tremendous network effects, and it gets to grab a piece of millions of transactions across mobility, food delivery, and other such services.\n\nIn addition, Uber has had a massive opportunity to build brand awareness and loyalty in recent years. The pandemic caused a huge disruption to shopping and dining out, giving Uber the chance to impress customers with efficient food and grocery delivery.\n\nAnd while Uber has grown its business and seen revenues surge, it has still struggled to convert that into consistent profitability. UBER stock is going for a lofty 65 times forward earnings right now.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Uber will be able to push profitability that much farther from here, either. The company is increasingly facing regulatory pushback as consumers and restaurant owners complain about high fees and drivers claim that they are underpaid. All this suggests that Uber will struggle to raise its margins from here which in turn would imply that shares are dramatically overvalued.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Dell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors probably remember Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) as a company that makes personal computers. And Dell still has a large consumer electronics business to be certain.\n\nHowever, it merged with EMC in 2016, and in doing so, it became a leader in storage, information security, and consulting functions as well. DELL stock has hummed along, largely under the radar, for many years due to its largely unglamorous collection of business operations.\n\nThat has changed recently, however, with DELL stock rising an incredible 199% over the past 12 months.\n\nIn particular, DELL stock has soared more than 35% over the past month. This came following an earnings report where Dell highlighted rapid growth in its AI server sales. Despite this, however, Dell\u2019s overall revenues actually declined 11% year-over-year for the quarter.\n\nAt this price, investors are pricing in way too much optimism based on Dell\u2019s AI functions, even as the overall business is not showing much favorable momentum. Morningstar\u2019s William Kerwin agrees; he believes DELL shares are worth just $55 each, implying that the stock has more than 50% downside from here once the AI server hype fades.\n\nSoundhound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Dell, I believe Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) has rallied more due to general enthusiasm around artificial intelligence than any specific strengths at this particular company.\n\nSoundhound AI is a small unprofitable firm that aims to develop and commercialize voice, sound, and natural language artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nSOUN stock quadrupled in February. This came due to news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) had taken a position in Soundhound AI. Sounds great, right? However, Nvidia invests in a variety of smaller companies, and these bets can be quite small. Reportedly, Nvidia invested a modest $3.7 million in SOUN stock, which is better than nothing but not necessarily a massive vote of confidence either.\n\nSOUN stock has cooled off a bit recently following a disappointing earnings report. While revenues grew sharply, the company reported a wider-than-expected operating loss and hasn\u2019t even reached breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis yet. Shares seem wildly overvalued at their current $1.8 billion market capitalization given that analysts foresee just $70 million in revenues for 2024.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Celsius Holdings (CELH) A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnergy drink marker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has given its investors a jolt. CELH stock is up 200% over the past year, and a stunning 7,000% over the past five years.\n\nNeedless to say, early investors in Celsius have enjoyed blockbuster returns. But at some point, the risk/reward ratio turns against shareholders. We are at that point today following Celsius stock\u2019s 56% year-to-date rally.\n\nIncredibly, Celsius has posted these incredible gains even as the company\u2019s latest quarterly report saw its earnings per share fall short of expectations. Yes, revenues are still soaring, but the firm appears to be giving up ground on pricing to drive its revenue growth, leading to slipping profit margins.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Celsius had a tremendous run when it was a small company. But it is now a more mature business with fewer growth opportunities that faces robust competition. This will make it exceedingly difficult for CELH stock to maintain its current 80 times forward P/E ratio.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company that offers treatments for a wide variety of ailments.\n\nThe firm has enjoyed incredible performance over the past year thanks to its GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro, which have become blockbuster products for helping with weight loss and diabetes management.\n\nThese drugs are helping lots of people, and the company\u2019s sales are likely to continue to grow in the coming years. However, the valuation has seemingly gotten way out of hand, with LLY stock up more than 125% over the past year. Eli Lilly now has a market capitalization of almost $700 billion and sells for a stunning 60 times forward earnings.\n\nAnalysts project that Lilly will bring in about $41 billion in annual revenues this year, and topline growth is around 20%. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not nearly enough to support a $700 billion market cap given the short patent lives of pharmaceutical drugs before they give way to generic competition.\n\nEli Lilly is enjoying a windfall right now, but the party is going to end a lot sooner than LLY stockholders realize.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain. The company completed its IPO in 2023 and the stock has now doubled since last fall.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why there is so much enthusiasm, though. The bull case is that Cava can be the Chipotle of Greek food. In a vacuum, that may sound like an enticing pitch. But many fast casual chains have tried to become the Chipotle of some specific cuisine and the vast majority invariably fizzle out.\n\nThe fast casual dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. This adds up to a scary outlook for CAVA stock given that it is trading at a jaw-dropping 200 times forward earnings and 10 times revenues today. Those sorts of multiples are hard for restaurants to maintain even if their business execution is perfect.\n\nMy guess is that Cava will be more like the next\u00a0Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). Shake Shack, you may recall, went public back in 2015 and became a momentum stock for a time with traders bidding it up fourfold following the IPO.\n\nSince then, SHAK shares have underperformed despite a dramatic amount of growth in its underlying business. Given Cava\u2019s similarly sky-high multiples, it will take many years for the company\u2019s growth to catch up with today\u2019s stock price, if it ever does at all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Finding great companies while they are still small is a smart strategy to identify stocks that can potentially make you a millionaire investor. It's all about putting money to work in growing companies that still have a large expansion opportunity. But it can take time for even the best growth stocks to grow your savings. If you had bought $10,000 of Walmart stock in 1980, it would have turned into $1 million after 18 years.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at three promising companies that a team of Motley Fool contributors believe have the potential to grow significantly in value over the long term.\n\nThe next great restaurant growth story\n\nJohn Ballard (Cava Group): Every decade, it seems like at least one new restaurant chain emerges in the stock market and goes on to deliver massive returns for early investors. A $10,000 investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) at its initial public offering in the early 2000s would already be worth $611,000. Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) could be next in line.\n\nCava is focused on the Mediterranean fast-casual market, where there's a lot of opportunity for a dominant national chain to fill a void in the industry and do very well. Cava only had 309 restaurants at the end of 2023, but management is aiming for 1,000 restaurants. That might prove conservative given the footprint of more established chains like Chipotle, but the initial target should provide enough runway for growth to deliver excellent returns to start.\n\nA couple of strong quarters of growth have already sent the stock up 33% from its initial public offering price last year. Revenue grew 52% year over year in the fourth quarter. This growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of restaurants opened compared to the year-ago quarter, in addition to a solid 11% increase in same-store sales.\n\nIt was also encouraging to see Cava turn the year-ago net loss of $18.8 million into a profit of $2 million. For the full year, Cava earned a restaurant-level profit margin of nearly 25%, which means earnings per share should continue to grow as it expands across the U.S. It currently operates in just 24 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis restaurant chain has everything a growth investor needs: A concept that is resonating with customers across multiple states, a long runway of growth, and a profitable restaurant model.\n\nA great growth stock at a deep discount\n\nJeremy Bowman (Roku): The S&P 500 is back at an all-time high, and valuations are soaring in multiple sectors. However, one growth stock has been left behind by the recent rally. That's Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU).\n\nShares of the leading streaming distribution platform suffered a double whammy recently. The company delivered a disappointing earnings report in February, and Walmart announced the following week that it was acquiring Vizio, a TV manufacturer with a streaming platform. This sent Roku down again.\n\nRoku is now trading down 41% from its peak in November, setting up a great buying opportunity.\n\nFirst, there was nothing particularly alarming in the Q4 earnings report last month. Roku beat revenue estimates, but management seemed uncertain about the trajectory of the recovery in the ad market, and the company failed to give specific guidance for 2024. The media and entertainment advertisers that it caters to are still struggling as legacy media companies pivot to streaming, but that should change over the next year or two.\n\nAdvertising tiers at services like Netflix, Walt Disney, and Amazon are picking up steam, and new streaming services are expected to launch, like the new sports-focused joint venture from Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery. Disney also set a date for its flagship ESPN streaming service next fall, which could be the biggest launch ever in streaming.\n\nThe volatility that Roku is currently facing should smooth out over time as digital advertising recovers and the streaming landscape stabilizes. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the business, and it still has a huge growth opportunity in front of it, despite a new challenge from Walmart. After all, Roku has grown in spite of competing with tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple.\n\nInvestors can take advantage of a discount on a stock that could easily be a multibagger over the long term by buying today.\n\nMany millionaires already minted\n\nJennifer Saibil (Chipotle Mexican Grill): There are few stocks that are as reliable for growth as Chipotle Mexican Grill. It consistently delivers higher sales and profits, and it still has a long growth runway.\n\nRevenue increased 14.3% year over year in 2023, and comparable sales were up 7.9%. It operates with incredible efficiency, and operating margin expanded from 13.4% last year to 15.8% this year. Earnings per share increased 38% to $44.34. Chipotle generated more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow last year, and it carries no debt.\n\nChipotle was a forerunner of the fast-casual dining segment, and its popular, mid-priced fare draws customers even in more challenging economies. It targets a more affluent, resilient customer who can afford to spend a little more even with high inflation. It's likely to do even better when inflation moderates.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Chipotle operates 3,437 stores. It opened 271 in 2023, and expects to open about 300 stores this year. It has longer-term plans to expand to 7,000 stores in North America, giving it plenty of room to keep growing. It also recently announced its first-ever international franchise partnership for stores in the Middle East.\n\nChipotle has been a market-beating stock throughout its lifetime, and by a wide margin. Investors can be confident in its continued opportunities. Even if you've missed Chipotle stock's incredible run until now, you can benefit from its future potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors are eating up Cava (CAVA).\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of the Mediterranean fast casual chain hit a new record of $59.91. Shares are up more than 40% year-to-date, jumping as much as 19% in the last five days after posting a beat on its top and bottom lines for its Q4 results.\n\nFor comparison, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up more than 7% year to date, whereas fast casual powerhouse Chipotle (CMG) is up nearly 20%.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Cava's revenue came in at $177.17 million, versus the $174.09 million expected, while adjusted earnings were $0.02, versus the $0.01 estimated.\n\nSame-store sales soared 11.40% year-over-year, handily besting the 6.25% Wall Street had anticipated.\n\n\"Our results are reflective of how we're able to demonstrate the power of our category defining brand,\" CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance. He believes there is major \"white space potential in front of us\" in the Mediterranean food sector.\n\nIn a note to clients, JP Morgan analyst John Ivankoe wrote that he believes the company's team and operating structure \"supports the likelihood of CAVA becoming a highly visible, important national brand that should dominate the large and flexible \u201cMediterranean\u201d category.\"\n\nStifel analyst Chris O'Cull wrote to clients that Cava's \"premium valuation can be justified by its healthy unit economics, development visibility, and solid operating momentum,\" which could lead to \"further upward revisions to near-term estimates and long-term earnings potential.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Andy Barish increased his price target 16% from $48.00 to $66.00 following the Q4 results, citing \"an attractive runway ahead for CAVA to further scale.\"\n\nOne persistent problem \u2014 labor costs \u2014 has followed the restaurant industry into 2024.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 22 states raised their minimum wages, while Oregon, Nevada, and Florida are set to increase theirs later this year.\n\nAnd California is facing a looming wage jump as a result of AB 1228 and its predecessor, the FAST Act. Beginning Apr. 1, food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide will be required to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company plans to \"absorb that 30 basis point impact,\" Schulman said, adding that it has always \"aspired\" to pay more than the average wage, as well as \"be competitive and have attractive wages in every market we operate in.\"\n\nIn 2024, the company expects restaurant level profit margin to be between 22.7% and 23.3%, or 150 to 210 basis points below 2023's. Schulman said that the impact on margin from the higher wage growth is \"an investment in our team that will create...restaurant level margin growth over the long haul.\"\n\nIn January, Cava increased menu prices by 2.5% to 3%. The average price per person, which includes premium add-ons to the entrees, is now $14. In August 2023, Schulman told Yahoo Finance the average price per person was \"a little bit north of $13.50.\"\n\n\"We have pricing elasticity,\" he said when asked about his company's pricing power. \"We don't want to just take it because it's there, we want to put the best value proposition for it for our guests,\" he added.\n\nCFO Tricia Tolivar said the company expects the cost of food to increase in the low to mid-single digits in 2024, but Shulman said its new steak offering \"is a premium item and it will be priced as such...we see it as dollar margin neutral to our basket.\" CAVA in Waldorf, Maryland featuring digital order pickup. (Courtesy of CAVA)\n\nCava lays out slow and steady growth plans\n\nBy 2032, the company plans to have 1,000 Cava locations.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2023, the company had 309 locations, with 72 opened last year, and plans to launch 48 to 52 this year.\n\n\"We are projecting 15% compound annual unit growth,\" Schulman shared, \"we feel really comfortable about our pipeline and our ability to maintain this growth rate.\"\n\nIt plans to enter Chicago this year with three locations, sticking to the model of penetrating established markets.\n\nIvankoe believes the brand is a \"preferred tenant,\" especially as \"the high-profile IPO draws attention to the company\u2019s cash rich balance sheet with less than $300 million and prospects for brand longevity.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the company also got its new food processing facility up and running in Verona, Virginia, which can serve up to at least 750 Cava stores. In addition, it can supply packaged goods like its Crazy Feta and Harissa for up to 1,000 stores.\n\n\"We are in about 650 grocery outlets today and we are slowly growing that,\" Schulman shared, with the new facility providing an opportunity to scale its packaged foods business in the future.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This reflects a meaningful 19% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 85% to US$0.22. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$854.1m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.16 in 2024. Although the revenue estimates have not really changed, we can see there's been a very substantial lift in earnings per share expectations, suggesting that the analysts have become more bullish after the latest result.\n\nThe analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 30% to US$61.40. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic CAVA Group analyst has a price target of US$66.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$40.00. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the CAVA Group's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that CAVA Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 19% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 29% growth over the last year. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 9.5% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while CAVA Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around CAVA Group's earnings potential next year. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for CAVA Group going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for CAVA Group that you need to take into consideration.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 27, 2024\n\nCAVA Group, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.02, expectations were $0.01. CAVA isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the CAVA Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, February 27, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Milanovich, SVP of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Milanovich: Good morning, and welcome to CAVA\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results conference call. Before we begin, I want to thank you for joining us today on late notice. Yesterday, a media outlet reached an embargo agreement and released a story about our financial results in error [ph], prompting us to issue our earnings release and host this call ahead of schedule. If you do not already have a copy of the earnings release and related 8-K furnished with the SEC, they\u2019re available on our website at investor.cava.com, which we encourage you to review. The purpose of this conference call is to give investors further details regarding the company\u2019s financial results, as well as a general update on the company\u2019s progress.\n\nYou will find reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measure discussed on today\u2019s call to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP to the extent available without unreasonable efforts in today\u2019s earnings release and supplemental deck, each of which is posted on the company\u2019s website. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that this call will contain forward-looking statements. For this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking statement. Investors should be aware that any forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese risk factors are explained in detail in CAVA\u2019s filings with the SEC. Please refer to these filings for a more detailed discussion of forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties of such statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and except as required by law, CAVA undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the company\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brett Schulman.\n\nBrett Schulman: Thanks, Matt, and welcome to the call, everyone. In 2023, we demonstrated the power of our category-defining brand and the significant whitespace opportunity ahead of us. We opened 72 net new restaurants during the year, growing our footprint by more than 30%. Traffic in our existing restaurants continued to climb. And following a successful IPO, we generated 3 consecutive quarters of positive net income. As we create the next large-scale cultural cuisine category, our extraordinary potential is clear. We fulfill consumers\u2019 growing desire for bold, unique flavors with no compromise between taste and health. Our Mediterranean concept has broad appeal across genders, generations, and income levels and proven portability from coast to coast in cities and suburbs.\n\nWe now have a presence in 24 states in the District of Columbia and continue to target annual unit growth of 15% or more with a long-term goal of 1,000 restaurants by 2032. We\u2019ve built a strong foundation to support that growth, and our powerful unit economic engine continues to drive us forward. Even with continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our value proposition is resonating with consumers. The investments we make in our team members and our guests support that value proposition. We are working on behalf of our team members by investing in attractive wages and benefits, enhanced training, and career development opportunities. We are working on behalf of our guests by mitigating price increases and by not taking outsized pricing to offset unplanned costs related to the impact of new legislation, like AB 1228 in California, which includes aspects of its predecessor bill known as the FAST Act.\n\nWe see the impact of these investments come to life every day. I was on a plane the other day, heading home from visiting our team in LA, when one of the flight attendants saw my CAVA sweatshirt, stopped, and let me know effusively how much she and her daughter love and appreciate our food, and most importantly, the value we offer. When it comes to the team, there\u2019s no better example of the return on our investment than the recent promotion of a team member in our Virginia Beach restaurant, Ricky Martin Jr. Ricky joined us as an entry-level role 4 years ago just before the pandemic. He has grown under the training of our academy general manager, Nick Blalock, and was just promoted to guest experience manager. Investing in our teams and our guests enables us to deliver on the Mediterranean way that sets us apart and we believe will continue to drive traffic and support sustainable expansion, while increasing profitability and shareholder value over the long-term.\n\nOur results in the fourth quarter of 2023 were outstanding with a more than 52% increase in CAVA revenue; 11.4% CAVA same-restaurant sales growth, including a 6.2% increase in traffic; 19 net new restaurants, ending the quarter with 309 restaurants, a 30% increase year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA of $15.7 million, a $12.2 million increase over the fourth quarter of 2022; and net income of $2 million. And for the full year, we delivered record results, including a nearly 60% increase in CAVA revenue; 17.9% CAVA same-restaurant sales growth, including a 10.4% increase in traffic; 72 net new restaurants; adjusted EBITDA of $73.8 million, a $61.2 million increase over 2022; and net income of $13.3 million. Our 2023 performance was grounded in the execution of our strategic plan.\n\nI\u2019m going to touch on the highlights of what we accomplished in Q4 and the full year before laying out the evolution of our strategy and what we are setting out to accomplish in 2024. In Q4, we continued our expansion across the country, opening locations in 9 different states, further exhibiting the portability of our brand. We also opened our last remaining Zoes conversion and are operating under a single powerful CAVA brand. As we work to build a best-in-class organization, we rolled out updated food safety protocols in Q4, including the completion of our transition to a new third-party auditor with more frequent and stringent restaurant audits. We also expanded training content and further strengthened our robust accountability procedures through our critical 4-initiative, which codifies our food safety priorities for our team.\n\nTo deliver on these standards, as well as efficient operations and an incredible guest experience as we scale, we continue to grow our people development pipeline. We ended 2023 with 55 Academy GMs, including 7 recently promoted to the multiunit leader position, exceeding our target for the year. In addition, we delivered on our 2023 target to internally place 75% of our new restaurant GMs. Our team-building work, both at our restaurants and in our collaboration centers, has created a highly engaged team. According to industry expert Denison Consulting, an Employee Net Promoter Score, or eNPS, above the 50th percentile indicates a high level of engagement. In our most recent team member survey, we ranked in the top quartile, our highest score to date.\n\nTeam members also rated us in the top quintile, on average, in the diversity and inclusion category, and we are proud to be named by Newsweek as one of America\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity. To further the success of our team and our business as we scale, we\u2019ve built additional infrastructure to support our plans for growth. We\u2019re excited to announce that our new manufacturing facility in Verona, Virginia, has commenced operations. A 55,000-square-foot production facility, Verona produces CAVA dips and spreads and along with our existing facility in Laurel, Maryland, can support at least 750 restaurants, as well as the growth of our CPG business. This vertically integrated model takes complexity out of the restaurants and improves costs overall and lets us maintain the quality and integrity of our chef-crafted recipes.\n\nOn the culinary front, our best-in-class team continues to innovate, creating newness in our menu and giving guests reasons to try CAVA and come back more often. A prime example of this is our new grilled steak protein. Our Mediterranean take on this beloved main demonstrates the bold, unique flavors that make CAVA special. It is rich but not heavy, and features the brightness of sun-dried tomato, herby oregano, and a touch of red chili for fruity heat. Our Dallas and Boston market tests are progressing well, and we expect to roll steak out company-wide in the second half of 2024. Turning to loyalty, we are in the early stages of launching a new program aimed at developing deeper connections with our passionate customer base, creating more frequent, relevant experiences and further driving traffic, mix, and check.\n\nAt the end of 2023, we transitioned all loyalty members to a new construct that lets them earn and bank points. In the Houston market, we started testing new types of rewards to redeem and new ways to engage guests. We are moving to the next stage gate with an expanded test of the Houston pilot in the Carolinas market. Early results are meeting expectations, and we expect to roll out a new rewards program company-wide at the end of this year. Before turning the call over to Tricia, I\u2019d like to touch on our 2024 strategic plan, which reflects our evolving strategy and builds on our accomplishments to date with 4 key pillars. The first pillar, expand our Mediterranean way in communities across the country, encompasses 3 key areas: the first area is growing our footprint and expanding channel access. A close-up image of a colorful salad platter with toppings and dressings.\n\nThis includes new restaurant growth and initiatives like our catering test; the second area is fueling our culinary innovation and communication engine to drive traffic, mix, and check, illustrated by our planned steak launch in the second half of the year; and the last area is expressing our concept essence consistently across brand properties, which includes the rollout of Project Soul, our new, finalized 3.0 design, which creates a more inviting physical space for in-restaurant occasions. Our second pillar is focused on developing personal relationships with guests, even as we scale. This includes creating a cohesive physical and digital journey for guests, driven by a reimagined loyalty program and using our digital ecosystem for one-to-one communication that can deepen connections with guests and create more personalized experiences.\n\nBased on the results we\u2019re seeing to date, we believe this work can further strengthen our value proposition, powerfully express our brand across multiple touchpoints, and create differentiated thoughtful moments that make the CAVA experience stand out. The third pillar, run great restaurants every location, every shift, emphasizes an ongoing focus on enhancing our training and standards to consistently deliver our CAVA hospitality and food safety protocols. We believe that this work, combined with a focus on streamlining and automating prep, as well as leveraging AI technologies to improve forecasting and accuracy through our new connected kitchen initiative, will make our restaurants easier to operate, drive improved operational efficiency and effectiveness, and enhance the guest experience.\n\nOur fourth and final pillar, operate as a high-performing team, includes deepening our culture of accountability; developing enhanced data capabilities to unlock powerful, actionable insights and improve productivity; and implementing programs and tools to further engage, retain, and connect our teams. We will continue to evolve and enhance our talent strategies, expand and deepen our knowledge of the customer, and strengthen our HR systems while fostering a mindset of growth and discipline. I want to thank our team members for their contributions to a record-setting year and for their commitment to bringing heart, health, and humanity to food. We are proud of all we have accomplished in 2023, including our entrance into the public market, but we know that we are just at the beginning of all that is possible for CAVA, and we look forward to the journey ahead.\n\nWith that, I\u2019ll let Tricia walk you through the financials.\n\nTricia Tolivar: Thanks, Brett, and good morning, everyone. CAVA revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew 52.5% year-over-year to $175.5 million. Same restaurant sales increased 11.4%, driven by traffic growth of 6.2%. Fiscal 2023 had a 53rd week, which we excluded from our same restaurant sales calculation. We noted broad-based same restaurant sales strength across vintages, regions, and both suburban and urban locations. We opened 19 net new CAVA restaurants in the fourth quarter, bringing our total CAVA restaurant count to 309. We continue to be pleased with the top-line and margin performance of new restaurant openings. In addition, our proven portability is reflected in our overall AUV above $2.6 million with all geographies $2.3 million or more.\n\nCAVA restaurant-level profit in the fourth quarter was $39.3 million, or 22.4% of revenue versus $23 million, or 20% of revenue in the prior year, representing a 70.7% increase. The margin expansion was largely a result of improved food, beverage, and packaging costs, and sales leverage, including the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by incremental wage investments. CAVA\u2019s food, beverage, and packaging costs were 28.8% of revenues, lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 by 210 basis points, driven by lower input costs and higher incidence of premium menu items driving favorable product mix. CAVA labor and related costs were 27.8%, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects investments in our team member wages that we discussed on the third quarter earnings call, partially offset by leverage from increased sales compared to the prior year.\n\nCAVA occupancy and related expenses were 8.3% of revenue, an improvement of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter 2022 due to increased sales leverage. CAVA other operating expenses were 12.7% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting investments in the integrity of our physical spaces in support of our increased restaurant volumes. Shifting to overall performance, our general and administrative expenses for the quarter, excluding stock-based compensation, was $21.3 million, compared to $15.3 million in Q4 of 2022. This $6 million increase is primarily driven by investments to support our growth, performance-based incentive compensation, recurring public company costs, and legal accruals. As a percentage of revenue, G&A, excluding stock-based compensation, was 12% in the current quarter, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter, driven by the aforementioned items, partially offset by sales leverage.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, including the burden of preopening costs for the quarter, was $15.7 million, which was $12.2 million higher than Q4 of 2022. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by 11.4% CAVA same restaurant sales growth, improved CAVA restaurant-level profit margin, and the performance of new openings. Keep in mind, Q4 preopening costs included expenses related to the restaurants opened during the quarter, as well as costs related to the 11 units we opened to date in Q1 of 2024. We reported $2 million of net income, compared with a net loss of $18.8 million in Q4 of 2022, representing an increase of $20.8 million. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.02 in the quarter, compared with a diluted loss per share of $13.72 in Q4 of 2022.\n\nShifting to liquidity. At the end of the quarter, we had zero debt outstanding, $332.4 million in cash on hand, and access to a $75 million undrawn revolver with an option to increase our liquidity if needed. We delivered cash flow from operations of $97.1 million for the year, compared with $6 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by our improved operations, driving increased profitability across the fleet. I would like to touch on our development pipeline. The pipeline we\u2019ve built is diverse and not dependent on a small number of markets, landlords, or site profiles. Our development team has built increased buffer into our pipeline to ensure we are insulated from potential delays in equipment availability, permitting, and inspections.\n\nAt the same time, we are actively building a robust pipeline for 2025, positioning us for continued growth in new and existing markets. Turning to our outlook for full year 2024, we expect the following: 48 to 52 net new CAVA restaurant openings; CAVA same restaurant sales growth of 3% to 5%; CAVA restaurant-level profit margin between 22.7% and 23.3%; preopening costs between $11.5 million and $12.5 million; and adjusted EBITDA, including the burden of preopening costs, between $86 million and $92 million. I want to share some additional thoughts for our 2024 outlook. As you know, we took an approximate 3% in-restaurant menu price increase in January 2024. We continue to invest in creating value for our guests, and we do not have plans at the current time to take further price increases in response to AB 1228, whose predecessor was the California FAST Act.\n\nWe expect approximately a 30 basis point reduction in restaurant-level profit margin in the near-term, which is contemplated in our full year guidance, but to also drive value for our guests and shareholders over the long-term. Our 2024 same restaurant sales guidance implies a 2-year stack in the low-20s, which is in line with the back half of 2023. Our same restaurant sales guidance also takes into consideration the Q1 2023 benefit of an unseasonably mild winter and the halo from our IPO that benefited Q2 2023, and to a lesser extent, the third quarter of 2023. Our results in 2023 demonstrate the power of our operating model. This is an important time in our growth trajectory, and our 2024 guidance reflects our investments to deliver on our model as we scale and grow.\n\nWe expect restaurant-level profit margin to be between 22.7% and 23.3% or 150 to 210 basis points below 2023. This incorporates the previously discussed 120 basis point increase in wages implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023 as part of our investment in team members, along with additional near-term investments to drive restaurant-level margin expansion over the long-term. We expect similar seasonality of restaurant-level profit margin throughout 2024. And as a reminder that our first quarter includes 16 weeks. Before going to Q&A, I want to acknowledge our restaurant, manufacturing, and collaboration center teams for the outstanding results they delivered in 2023. Through their collective ambition and passion for positivity, they reinforced our proven portability and powerful unit economics.\n\nCAVA continues to get stronger with every new restaurant we open and every new guest we welcome to our table. Now, I will turn the call back over to the operator to open it up for Q&A.\n\nSee also 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024 and 10 Best Car Insurance in Texas for 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

Profit Margin: Restaurant-level profit margin improved to 24.8%, reflecting operational efficiencies. Digital Revenue Mix: Digital sales accounted for 36.0% of CAVA's total revenue.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HSIC. Cava Group Inc (CAVA) Reports Robust Fiscal 2023 Results with Significant Revenue and Profit Growth\n\nOn February 26, 2024, Cava Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) released its 8-K filing, announcing its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. The company, known for its Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand, has shown a remarkable performance with significant revenue growth and profitability improvements.\n\nCAVA's operations are conducted as two reportable segments: CAVA and Zoes Kitchen, with the former being the primary focus following the winding down of Zoes Kitchen operations. The company's strategic growth and operational efficiency have been key drivers behind its impressive financial results.\n\nFiscal Year 2023 Performance Highlights\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023, CAVA reported a revenue increase of 59.8% to $717.1 million, compared to $448.6 million in the previous year.

        "content": "Full Year CAVA Revenue Growth of 59.8% Driven by CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 17.9%\n\n72 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings During Fiscal 2023\n\nFull Year CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 24.8%\n\nWASHINGTON, February 27, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE: CAVA) (\"CAVA Group\" or the \"Company\"), the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand that brings heart, health, and humanity to food, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n\"2023 was a landmark year for CAVA, one that demonstrated our significant whitespace opportunity and the strength of our operating model and Team Members as we define the next big cultural cuisine category. Following a successful IPO, we delivered three consecutive quarters of positive net income, driven by full-year revenue growth of nearly 60%. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales grew nearly 18%, including traffic growth of more than 10%, and we opened 72 net new restaurants, increasing our footprint by 30%. With our powerful unit economic engine and investments in an efficient, scalable operation, we are well positioned to deliver on our extraordinary potential,\" said Brett Schulman, Co-Founder and CEO.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights:\n\nCAVA Revenue grew 52.5% to $175.5 million as compared to $115.0 million in the prior year quarter. Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings of 19, bringing total CAVA Restaurants to 309, a 30.4% increase in total CAVA Restaurants year over year. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 11.4%, which excludes the 53rd week of fiscal 2023. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit of $39.3 million or growth of 70.7% over the prior year quarter, with CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 22.4%, a 240 basis point increase over the prior year quarter. CAVA Digital Revenue Mix was 35.9%. CAVA Group Net Income of $2.0 million compared to net loss of $18.8 million in the prior year quarter. CAVA Group Adjusted EBITDA of $15.7 million compared to $3.5 million in the prior year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiscal Year 2023 Highlights:\n\nCAVA Revenue grew 59.8% to $717.1 million as compared to $448.6 million in the prior year. Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings of 72 CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 17.9%, which excludes the 53rd week of fiscal 2023. CAVA AUV of $2.6 million, excluding the 53rd week of fiscal 2023, as compared to $2.4 million in the prior year. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit of $177.5 million or growth of 94.8% over the prior year, with CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 24.8%, a 450 basis point increase over the prior year. CAVA Digital Revenue Mix was 36.0%. CAVA Group Net Income of $13.3 million compared to net loss of $59.0 million in the prior year. CAVA Group Adjusted EBITDA of $73.8 million compared to $12.6 million in the prior year.\n\nCAVA Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Review:\n\nCAVA Revenue was $175.5 million, an increase of 52.5% compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by 95 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 11.4%, and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth consists of 6.2% from guest traffic and 5.2% from menu price and product mix.\n\nCAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin was 22.4%, an increase of 240 basis points compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin increased due to lower food, beverage, and packaging as a percentage of revenue, driven by lower input costs and higher incidence of premium menu items driving favorable product mix, as well as sales leverage including the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by incremental wage investments.\n\nCAVA Group Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Review:\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, or 13.9% of revenue, as compared to $16.3 million, or 12.5% of revenue, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation1, were $21.3 million, or 12.0% of revenue, as compared to $15.3 million, or 11.7% of revenue, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The increase of 30 basis points was primarily due to investments in our collaboration center organization to support our growth, recurring public company costs, higher performance-based incentive compensation, and higher legal accruals, partially offset by leverage from higher sales.\n\nNet income was $2.0 million, or 1.2% of revenue, as compared to net loss of $18.8 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $15.7 million, or 8.9% of revenue, an increase of $12.2 million compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth, improved CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin, and the productivity of Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings. These increases were partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses compared with the prior year quarter, as previously noted.\n\nCAVA Fiscal 2023 Review:\n\nCAVA Revenue was $717.1 million, an increase of 59.8% compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by 145 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings during or subsequent to fiscal 2022, CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 17.9%, and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth consists of 10.4% from guest traffic and 7.5% from menu price and product mix.\n\nCAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin was 24.8%, an increase of 450 basis points compared to fiscal 2022. CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin increased due to lower food, beverage, and packaging as a percentage of revenue, driven by lower input costs and higher incidence of premium menu items driving favorable product mix, as well as sales leverage, partially offset by incremental wage investments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nCAVA Group Fiscal 2023 Review:\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $101.5 million, or 13.9% of revenue, as compared to $70.0 million, or 12.4% of revenue, in fiscal 2022. General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs1, were $90.8 million, or 12.5% of revenue, as compared to $66.1 million, or 11.7% of revenue, in fiscal 2022. The increase of 80 basis points was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, investments in our collaboration center organization to support our growth, recurring public company costs, and higher legal accruals, partially offset by leverage from higher sales.\n\nNet income was $13.3 million, or 1.8% of revenue, as compared to net loss of $59.0 million in fiscal 2022.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $73.8 million, or 10.1% of revenue, an increase of $61.2 million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth, improved CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin, and the productivity of Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings. These increases were partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2023 compared with the prior year, as previously noted.\n\nFiscal 2023 includes a 53rd week that is not included in fiscal 2022, which contributed to an increase in CAVA Revenue of approximately $11 million. We estimate that CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin includes a benefit of approximately 50 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023 and full year 2023, respectively, due to the leverage associated with certain costs not impacted by the extra week. We estimate that the benefit to fiscal 2023 income from operations and Adjusted EBITDA of the 53rd week was approximately $2.5 million due to higher CAVA Revenue and CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense of approximately $1 million to support the growth of the business.\n\n__________________ 1 General and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are set forth in the tables at the end of this press release.\n\nFiscal 2024 Outlook:\n\nCAVA Group anticipates the following for fiscal 2024:\n\nNet New CAVA Restaurant Openings 48 to 52 CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth 3.0% to 5.0% CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin 22.7% to 23.3% Pre-opening costs $11.5 to $12.5 million Adjusted EBITDA $86.0 to $92.0 million\n\nActual results may differ materially from CAVA Group's fiscal full-year 2024 guidance as a result of, among other things, the factors described under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below.\n\nA reconciliation of the forward-looking fiscal 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted.\n\nAbout CAVA Group:\n\nCAVA is the category-defining Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant brand, bringing together healthful food and bold, satisfying flavors at scale. Our brand and our opportunity transcend the Mediterranean category to compete in the large and growing limited-service restaurant sector as well as the health and wellness food category. CAVA serves guests across gender lines, age groups, and income levels and benefits from generational tailwinds created by consumer demand for healthy living and a demographic shift towards greater ethnic diversity. We meet consumers\u2019 desires to engage with convenient, authentic, purpose-driven brands that view food as a source of self-expression. The broad appeal of our food combined with these favorable industry trends drive our vast opportunity for continued growth.\n\nEarnings Conference Call:\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on February 27, 2024 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results as well as provide a business update. Investors will have the opportunity to listen to the conference call live through the webcast from the company's website on the investor relations page at investor.cava.com. A recorded webcast will be available on CAVA's investor relations website shortly after the call and available for up to one year.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry, business strategy, goals, and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, and other financial and operating information. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"future,\" \"will,\" \"seek,\" \"foreseeable,\" \"outlook,\" the negative version of these words or similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this press release.\n\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management\u2019s expectations, beliefs, and projections will result or be achieved. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional, or local economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include but are not limited to the following: our operation in a highly competitive industry; our ability to open new restaurants while managing our growth effectively and maintaining our culture; our ability to successfully identify appropriate locations and develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets; the profitability of new restaurants, and any impact to sales at our existing locations; the impact of changes in guest perception of our brand; our ability to successfully market our restaurants and brand; the impact of food safety, health department regulations, and food-borne illness concerns together with our ability to adequately address such concerns and meet regulatory obligations, including at our manufacturing facilities; our ability to maintain or increase prices; our ability to accurately predict guest trends and demand and successfully introduce new menu offerings and improve our existing menu offerings; the risks associated with leasing property; our ability to successfully expand our digital and delivery business; our ability to utilize, recognize, respond to, and effectively manage the immediacy of social media; our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from past and potential future acquisitions, investments or other strategic initiatives; our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively; the impact of shortages, delays, or interruptions in the delivery of food items and other products; our ability to successfully optimize, operate, and manage our production facilities; the risks associated with our reliance on third parties; the impact of increases in food, commodity, energy, and other costs; the impact of increases in labor costs, labor shortages, and our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain the right team members; our ability to attract, develop, and retain our management team and key team members; the impact of any cybersecurity breaches and our ability to respond effectively to technology threats or events; the impact of failures, or interruptions in, or our inability to effectively scale and adapt, our information technology systems; our ability to comply with, or changes in, the extensive laws or regulations requirements to which we are subject, including those related to privacy; the impact of economic factors and guest behavior trends; the impact of evolving rules and regulations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters; risks associated with our ability to secure, and protect our intellectual property; risks associated with civil unrest, acts of terrorism, threats to national security, the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and other geopolitical events, including potential discriminatory perspectives towards certain cuisines; the impact of climate change and volatile adverse weather conditions; and each of the other factors set forth under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date of this press release and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this press release. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\nIn addition to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, in this press release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) margin, or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management\u2019s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, and debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the business growth or to reduce indebtedness. Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on any applicable debts; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense, or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nCAVA GROUP, INC.

        "title": "Feast on Profits: 3 Fast Food Stocks Cooking Up Hot Gains",
        "content": "The fast-food scene seems to be an intriguing place to invest these days with reasonable valuations and fairly defensive growth prospects. With a growing number of firms looking to feast on the profits from the booming market, not all fast-food firms are destined to reward their shareholders with returns above the market averages.\n\nThe firms that can grab more market share are worthy of a higher price tag. When it comes to growth in the fast-food world in the modern age, it\u2019s more than just about digitization, delivery and drive-thru, three traits that were the keys to success during the early days of the COVID pandemic.\n\nLooking ahead, restaurant modernization, automation and menu innovation could be the three keys to grabbing more share of the quick-serve restaurant market. Let\u2019s check in with three fast food stocks that look good to go in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) nosedived following the release of some distasteful quarterly earnings that saw some consumers shy away from the burger giant in favor of some good, old-fashioned home cooking. Once thought of as relatively inflation-resilient, it now seems that McDonald\u2019s has jacked up prices a tad too far, such that consumers have put their wallets away. Additionally, the value menu does not quite offer the same value proposition it used to, not after the storm of inflation.\n\nAt this juncture, it seems like McDonald\u2019s may be inclined to return to its value roots by addressing some of its consumers\u2019 affordability concerns. A viral photo of a $18 Big Mac meal is not doing McDonald\u2019s any favors on social media, especially as a fast-food firm that used to pride itself on food that\u2019s both tasty and affordable.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear that McDonald\u2019s overestimated the strength of its \u201cpricing power\u201d muscle. And now, it needs to beckon consumers back with better deals, new menu offerings and freshly renovated stores. A bit of automation couldn\u2019t hurt either, as firms beyond tech look to grab what AI has to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) had delivery down well before many of its peers in the affordable fast-food scene. Though peers, especially those outside the pizza market, have since caught up, I\u2019d argue that pizzas remain one of the better items to have delivered straight to your door. Pizza pies seem to be immune from the \u201csog\u201d effect, something that french fries from the local burger joint may succumb to on those lengthy rides over from the restaurant.\n\nAs Domino\u2019s looks to move on from an underwhelming past two years that saw shares actually fall by just over 3%, investors ought to be enticed by what the pizza chain has in store in 2024. The company is serious about clawing at the share of its competitors in the pizza world and has plans to get the job done. Specifically, the firm wants to open more corporate stores while expanding its footprint internationally.\n\nInternational growth could be where it\u2019s at as the company looks to repeat the success it enjoyed domestically. As to whether the effort will cook up hot gains this year remains to be seen. At 29.1 times trailing price-to-earnings, I do like the price of admission.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a lightweight in the restaurant scene with a modest $6 billion market cap. The Mediterranean restaurant chain recently received a \u201ctop pick\u201d rating from Baird. The firm views Cava as having \u201cmany of the same attributes\u201d that helped make Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) one of the firm\u2019s best growth picks. I think Baird is right to hold Cava stock in such high regard.\n\nUndoubtedly, Cava does seem to take a few pages out of an early-stage Chipotle\u2019s playbook. On the whole, Mediterranean food is quite fresh and healthy (like Chipotle\u2019s Mexican offerings), allowing it to gain from the secular tailwind of health and wellness.\n\nAdditionally, Cava is a small fish in a massive market that\u2019s ripe for disruption from new up-and-comers. All considered, Cava is a new-age growth play for those looking to play a different angle on the quick-serve restaurant scene.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Cava Group (CAVA) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.02 a share 15 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 27, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.02 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.01 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Cava Group has an Earnings ESP of 50%.\n\nCAVA is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Foot Locker (FL) as well.\n\nFoot Locker, which is readying to report earnings on March 6, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.52 a share, and FL is 23 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nFoot Locker's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 56% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33.\n\nStory continues\n\nCAVA and FL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Here's What to Expect From CAVA Group's (CAVA) Q4 Earnings",
        "content": "CAVA Group, Inc. CAVA is likely to have reported sequential earnings and total revenue decline when the company reports fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 results. The downtrend is quite likely to have been driven by lingering macroeconomic headwinds, restricted consumer spending and inflationary risks.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 700% and 2.5%, respectively. Moreover, sequentially earnings declined 71.4% but revenues grew 1.7%.\n\nHow Are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 earnings per share has increased to 1 cent from break-even earnings estimates over the past 30 days. In the last quarter, the company had reported earnings per share of 6 cents.\n\nCAVA Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CAVA Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCAVA Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | CAVA Group, Inc. Quote\n\nThe consensus mark for total revenues is pegged at $175.2 million, suggesting a sequential decline of 0.6% from the reported figure of $175.6 million.\n\nKey Factors to Consider\n\nFor the to-be-reported quarter, CAVA revenues (99% of total revenues in the fiscal third quarter of 2023) are expected to have witnessed a sequential decline due to persisting consumer headwinds and ongoing macroeconomic issues.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the bottom line of CAVA Group is likely to have witnessed a sequential decline. This was due to an increase in food, beverage, and packaging expenses along with labor inflation due to higher average hourly wages. Commodity inflation also adds to the downtrend.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, menu price increases and a favorable product mix are likely to have partially offset these negative aspects. These positive factors are likely to have driven the same restaurant sales growth of CAVA, resulting in sparked growth momentum. Also, new CAVA restaurant openings are likely to have supported the growth trend. The company\u2019s focus on category-defining brands and highly differentiated product offerings is likely to have aided its growth prospects to some extent.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for CAVA Group this time around.
