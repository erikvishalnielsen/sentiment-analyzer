        "title": "What Makes IBM (IBM) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at IBM (IBM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. IBM currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for IBM that show why this technology and consulting company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor IBM, shares are up 0.23% over the past week while the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.07% compares favorably with the industry's 5.73% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of IBM have risen 11.91%, and are up 30.45% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 7.45% and 20.76%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also take note of IBM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, IBM is averaging 3,127,896 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with IBM.\n\nOver the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost IBM's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.90 to $9.91 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that IBM is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep IBM on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nDifferent than value or growth investors, momentum-oriented investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms. Red Hat acquisition, in particular, has helped it in strengthening competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. With Red Hat buyout, the company offers Linux operating system \u2014 Red Hat Enterprise Linux \u2014 and hybrid cloud platform \u2014 Red Hat OpenShift \u2014 that aids enterprises with digital transformation. In addition, the company provides advanced information technology solutions, computer systems, quantum computing and super computing solutions, enterprise software, storage systems and microelectronics.\n\nIBM is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, with a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of B.

Looking at trading volume, an average of 3,127,895.50 shares exchanged hands over the last 20 trading days.\n\nMomentum investors don't just pay attention to price changes; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $9.91 per share. IBM boasts an average earnings surprise of 6.1%.\n\nWith strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding IBM to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM reported solid second-quarter results, wherein both the bottom and top lines beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and AI solutions with a client-focused portfolio and broad-based growth and remains firmly on track to reach its targets for 2024.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $1.83 billion or $1.96 per share compared with $1.58 billion or $1.72 per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line growth.\r\n\r\nExcluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $2.43 per share compared with $2.18 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27 cents.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | International Business Machines Corporation Quote\n\nQuarter Details\n\nQuarterly total revenues increased to $15.77 billion from $15.47 billion on strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments.

The top line beat the consensus estimate of $15.58 billion.\u00a0\r\n\r\nGross profit improved to $8.95 billion from $8.5 billion in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 56.8% and 54.9% owing to a strong portfolio mix. Total expenses increased to $6.73 billion from $6.5 billion due to higher R&D costs.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nSoftware: Revenues improved to $6.74 billion from $6.29 billion, driven by growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, Red Hat, Automation and Transaction Processing. The reported segment revenues beat our estimate of $6.61 billion on solid hybrid cloud traction. Segment profit was $2.11 billion compared with $1.75 billion in the year-ago quarter for margins of 31.3% and 27.8%, respectively. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation and generative AI offerings like watsonx.\r\n\r\nConsulting: Revenues were $5.18 billion compared with $5.23 billion a year ago as clients prioritized spending and pulled back on discretionary projects. The segment\u2019s revenues missed our estimate of $5.37 billion.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.43 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this technology and consulting company would post earnings of $1.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.68, delivering a surprise of 5.66%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nIBM , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, posted revenues of $15.77 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.48 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nIBM shares have added about 12.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for IBM?\n\nWhile IBM has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for IBM: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.24 on $15.06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.90 on $62.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Integrated Systems is currently in the bottom 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nPAR Technology (PAR), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024.\n\nThis software provider for the hospitality industry is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +71.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nPAR Technology's revenues are expected to be $116.65 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after disappointing earnings from heavyweight technology stocks sparked deep losses on Wall Street.\n\nMajor technology stocks rose in aftermarket trade, seeing a measure of bargain buying after suffering steep losses over the past week. Positive earnings from South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) also offered some positive signals on artificial intelligence-fueled demand.\n\nBut sentiment remained largely fragile, with uncertainty over the presidential race and an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting also keeping investors cautious.\n\nFocus this week is also on second-quarter gross domestic product data, while the PCE price index- which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- is due on Friday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,483.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,261.75 points by 20:03 ET (00:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,188.0 points.\n\nWall St walloped by tech losses after Tesla, Alphabet earnings disappoint\n\nFutures rose marginally after Wall Street clocked deep losses on Wednesday, as underwhelming earnings from heavyweights Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rattled markets.\n\nTesla steadied in aftermarket trade from a 12.3% slump during the session, as its second-quarter earnings missed estimates. The electric car maker offered middling cues on its plans for full self driving and robotaxis, while investors were unimpressed by CEO Elon Musk flagging progress in developing a humanoid robot, \u201cOptimus.\u201d\n\nAlphabet steadied from a 5% tumble, as signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased expenditure on AI largely offset an earnings beat.\n\nAnalysts were also concerned that the internet giant\u2019s earnings could herald a similar trend in its peers, especially amid fears that the increased spending on AI now appeared to be providing slowing returns.\n\nLosses in the two had spilled over into their peers on Wednesday, dragging Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively. AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) slumped 6.8%, although all three stocks rose marginally in after-hours trading.\n\nTech was already nursing steep losses over the past weeks, as the sector saw heavy profit-taking after hype over AI drove a major melt-up in valuation over the past year. Expectations of lower interest rates- on which the Fed is set to provide more cues next week- also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite slumped 3.6% to 17,345.84 points on Wednesday, largely leading losses among its peers. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% to 5,427.13 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% to 39,853.87 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle, IBM advance on strong Q2; Ford slumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) rose 3% after clocking stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. The fast casual Mexican restaurant chain logged strong comparable restaurant sales in the quarter.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) rose 2.4% after increased interest in AI helped the tech consulting firm log stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nBut on the other hand, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) slumped over 12% after clocking disappointing earnings, as automobile sales slowed sharply amid decreased consumer spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures limp higher after tech rout batters Wall Street\n\nBattery firm LG Energy Solution Q2 profit plunges on weak EV demand\n\nBoeing finalizes 737 MAX guilty plea deal, US outlines reasons\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "(Reuters) - IBM beat analysts' estimates for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, riding on strong demand for its software and higher AI-linked spending by clients looking to tap the booming technology.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $15.77 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $15.62 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nIBM has focused on expanding its Watsonx platform that allows users to deploy chatbots or enhance code for AI programs, while also making its Granite family of AI models open-source to help popularize its AI services.\n\nSales in the software segment increased about 7% to $6.74 billion. About 75% of the revenue was recurring, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters.\n\nThe company's AI Book of Business - a combination of bookings and actual sales across various products - grew to $2 billion, of which about $1 billion was added in the second quarter.\n\nConsulting made up 75% of the AI book with the rest coming from software, Kavanaugh said.\n\nStill, consulting revenue fell about 1% to $5.18 billion as clients cut back on discretionary spending and short-term consulting projects.\n\n\"You're seeing an overall very dynamic macroeconomic environment, and underneath that, clients are choosing technology for competitive advantage. They are spending on GenAI,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"But they are making trade-off decisions and spending reprioritizations, and you see that play out within consulting.\"\n\nCompanies have prioritized spending on longer-term consulting projects centered on their AI businesses - revenue from which is yet to be reflected in IBM's books.\n\nStill, second-quarter adjusted profit of $2.43 per share beat estimates of $2.20, as robust sales in the high-margin software business have helped offset consulting weakness.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru)\n\nView comments()",

That is double the $1 billion book-of-business IBM disclosed during its last quarterly earnings report in April.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the AI bookings are made up of consulting, with the rest from software, Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said in an interview. Over time, the revenue share from software is likely to increase, he added.\n\nSecond-quarter sales increased 2% to $15.8 billion, slightly ahead of the $15.6 billion average estimate from analysts. IBM\u2019s software unit revenue increased 7% to $6.7 billion, ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn recent years, Big Blue has worked to transform itself from a legacy hardware company into one focused on high-growth software and services. It has made moves to expand the company\u2019s offerings with its proposed takeover of Hashicorp Inc., announced in April, and last year\u2019s purchase of Apptio for $4.6 billion.\n\nRed Hat posted growth of 7%, another relatively slow quarter for the acquired software business that once regularly grew at about 20% a quarter. Bookings for Red Hat are up, a good signal for the second half of the year, Krishna said.\n\nStill, IBM\u2019s consulting segment continued to experience weakness. Unit revenue declined 1% to $5.2 billion, missing estimates.\n\nShares gained about 4% in extended trading after closing at $184.02 in New York. The stock has gained almost 13% this year.\n\nProfit, excluding some items, was $2.43 a share in the period ended June 30. Analysts, on average, projected $2.20. For the full year, IBM said free cash flow will be more than $12 billion. That represents a slight increase from a previous full-year guidance of \u201cabout\u201d $12 billion.\n\nLast week, Hashicorp said that regulators have requested additional information about its planned acquisition by IBM, suggesting increased scrutiny might delay the approval process.

        "content": "Investing.com - Jefferies released a research note on Tuesday, highlighting the need for tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) to accelerate its software momentum.\n\nDespite IBM 's outperformance of the IGV (iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF) by 7% YTD, Jefferies believes that the company's stock is likely to remain range-bound, with modest growth in the 3-4% range.\n\nThe three key areas analysts are monitoring include software growth, consulting, and AI contribution. The firm anticipates challenges in software growth due to tougher comparisons, and in consulting, which missed revenue expectations and saw a lowered guidance in the first quarter.\n\nFurthermore, Jefferies does not expect AI to make a significant contribution to the software sector this year.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIBM, often referred to as 'Big Blue', is seen as a slow-moving entity, with Wall Street predicting just 1% total revenue growth in 2Q and a 15% free cash flow (FCF) margin. The sluggish growth expectations are largely due to the consulting segment, where other industry players such as Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY) have reported ongoing uncertainty over discretionary spending projects.\n\nSoftware growth is projected to be 2.5% year-on-year, almost three times the overall revenue growth in 2Q. As IBM transitions towards a software-led model, the company's software performance is considered crucial for driving more substantial bottom-line growth. Software accounted for 40% of total revenue but approximately two-thirds of pre-tax income in CY23.\n\nIn 2Q, the software business is expected to contribute the majority of overall growth, as well as in FY24. The consensus estimate for software revenue in 2Q is $6.5 billion, representing a 2.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nJefferies emphasized the importance of strong execution in the Red Hat business and the successful integration of HCP for achieving sustainable software growth.\n\nThe consulting business growth expectations are relatively muted due to weaker near-term demand. However, Jefferies believes that AI will significantly benefit the consulting sector in the short term, with IBM recording over $1 billion of AI bookings over the last three quarters, primarily weighted towards consulting.\n\nAnalysts deemed the risk/reward as balanced, with IBM shares trading at 20 times CY25E EPS, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 32 times and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at 28 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies maintained their 'Hold' rating for IBM with a price target of $190.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJefferies analysis: IBM's future growth hinges on software momentum\n\nAfter-hours movers: Alphabet, Tesla, Texas Instruments, Seagate and more\n\nEnphase Energy's revenue reached $303.5 million\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Not so fast with Elon Musk's grand vision of society being overrun by Tesla (TSLA) humanoid robots, aka Optimus.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to call it what it is, right? I mean have you seen this thing do anything? It's bullsh*t,\" Meta's former VP of AI Jerome Pesenti told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see the video above or listen here).\n\nPesenti is no stranger to the AI space and all of its challenges.\n\nHe joined the tech industry in 1998 and worked in AI for several major players, including IBM (IBM). His most recent position, before founding AI powered education platform Sizzle AI, was as VP of AI for Meta (META), where he worked extensively on developing the Llama model.\n\nSays Pesenti on fears of a robot-run society, \"The real world is very complicated, and very unpredictable,\" adding one need not look any further than the autonomous driving industry to see the difficulties in bringing AI to life. SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 05 2024: Visitors check out Tesla's second-generation Optimus humanoid robot exhibited at the World AI Conference in Shanghai. (Photo credit should read / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Feature China via Getty Images)\n\nContrast Pesanti\u2019s sentiment with that of Musk, who introduced the first Optimus bots at an AI Day on August 19, 2021.\n\nThe prototype soon followed, complete with the ability to walk on two legs, use its hands and arms, and perform a range of complex tasks. The Tesla CEO has ceremoniously declared that robotics would take over cars as the main money driver at the company over time.\n\nThe current iteration of Optimus, says Musk, is able to perform \"simple\" factory tasks.\n\n\"As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined. Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy,\" Musk told investors on his late April earnings call.\n\nOn Monday, Musk wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"Tesla will have genuinely useful humanoid robots in low production for Tesla internal use next year and, hopefully, high production for other companies in 2026.\"\n\nThe billionaire has a track record of not meeting his deadlines.\n\nPesanti noted that humanoids \u201cwork well in factories when they have a small set of actions. They don\u2019t wash our clothes. They don\u2019t empty our dishwasher. They don\u2019t fold the stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is a business case for them though, reasons Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe total addressable market for humanoid robots is projected to reach $38 billion by 2035, up more than sixfold from a previous projection of $6 billion, according to recent research from Goldman Sachs analyst Jacqueline Du.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs says that there\u2019s been significant progress in end-to-end AI, through which models can train themselves, removing the need for a human engineer to code everything by hand.\n\nAs a result, that's speeding up robot development, allowing the machines to perform more tasks and adapt to new situations (such as working outside of factories) more quickly.\n\nRather than channeling Musk with AI robots, Pesenti is sticking with his software roots.\n\nPesanti created Sizzle after tutoring his children during COVID-19 lockdowns. An aha moment led him to create a free, accessible AI tutoring service.\n\nHe told Yahoo Finance the company has 12 employees and has raised millions in capital, and is focused on bringing new features to market.\n\nPesanti has plenty of optimism, even as AI has a long way to go. \u201cThe funny thing about AI is the more progress we make, the more we realize the goal is further away,\u201d he said.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Time to Buy Alphabet or IBM Stock as Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "Two tech giants highlighting this week\u2019s busy earnings lineup are Alphabet GOOGL and International Business Machines IBM which are set to report their Q2 results on Tuesday, July 24, and Wednesday, July 25 respectively.\n\nBelonging to the high-performing Magnificent Seven-themed stocks, GOOGL has soared +30% this year to edge the S&P 500 and Nasdaq while IBM\u2019s +12% has slightly trailed the broader indexes. Still, both have outperformed the broader market over the last three years.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy Alphabet or IBM\u2019s stock with each trading at just over $180 a share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Q2 Expectations\n\nMaking up the majority of its search engine revenue from Google, Alphabet\u2019s Advertising segment sales are thought to have increased 10% during Q2 to $64.27 billion based on Zacks estimates. Another catalyst to Alphabet\u2019s growth has been its Cloud segment revenue which is projected to soar 25% to $10.08 billion.\n\nOverall, Alphabet\u2019s Q2 sales are expected to increase 13% to $70.55 billion versus $62.07 billion in the comparative quarter. Furthermore, earnings are projected to climb 28% to $1.84 per share compared to EPS of $1.44 in Q2 2023.\n\nNotably, Alphabet has surpassed earnings expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 11.34% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM Q2 Expectations\n\nWhile Alphabet has been one of the most innovative tech companies in the modern age, IBM has begun to evolve itself as a provider of cloud and data platforms.\n\nKnown for its hardware and integrated computer offerings, IBM\u2019s Q2 sales are expected to be slightly up to $15.58 billion versus $15.48 billion in the prior-year quarter. However, Q2 EPS is projected to dip by roughly -1% to $2.16.\n\nIBM has also surpassed earnings expectations for five straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 5.2% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation Comparison\n\nWith their stocks edging toward $200 and trading at similar price tags, it\u2019s noteworthy that IBM has an 18.5X forward earnings multiple which is a nice discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 23.2X with GOOGL at 23.3X.\n\nIn terms of price to sales, IBM\u2019s P/S ratio is also more reasonable at 2.7X which is beneath the benchmark\u2019s 5.4X, and GOOGL at 7.5X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAhead of their Q2 reports, Alphabet and IBM\u2019s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While the anticipation of Alphabet\u2019s quarterly growth certainly stands out, IBM\u2019s valuation is very attractive with both companies being sound long-term investments in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 24, after the closing bell. The company is expected to have registered higher revenues from the consulting segment, backed by rising demand for technology consulting and business transformation services.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nThe Consulting segment comprises Business Transformation, Technology Consulting and Application Operations. It provides consulting and application management services that offer value and innovation to clients by leveraging industry, technology and business strategy, and process know-how.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, IBM inked a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Spain to accelerate AI innovations and bolster the national AI strategy. This partnership spans multiple facets of AI, such as AI supercomputing, development and deployment of ethical and responsible generative AI features, as well as the creation of language AI models proficient in Spanish and co-official languages. This will likely to have a favorable impact on net sales in the Consulting segment.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, Palo Alto Networks collaborated with IBM to improve its security platforms with the latter's AI capabilities in order to deliver AI-powered security solutions. Both companies are collaborating to set up a joint Security Operations Center and a Cyber Range for customer training, with IBM Consulting becoming a preferred Managed Security Services Provider for PANW.\n\nIBM consulting also collaborated with Masters digital team to bring AI-powered personalized and engaging digital experiences to viewers at the 88th Masters tournament. These developments are likely to have driven incremental revenues in the Consulting segment in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, IBM inked an agreement to acquire SKYARCH NETWORKS, a leader in AWS (Amazon Web Service) focused cloud development and managed services in Japan. The integration of SKYARCH\u2019s expertise in AWS will bolster IBM Consulting\u2019s hybrid cloud service offerings and strengthen its prospects in the region. This will likely get reflected in the upcoming results.\n\nOverall Expectations\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Consulting revenues is pegged at $5.32 billion, indicating growth from $5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for revenues from Consulting is pegged at $5.37 billion, implying 2.8% growth year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $15.58 billion. It generated revenues of $15.48 billion in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.16 per share, indicating a decline from $2.18 in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for IBM for the second quarter.

        "title": "Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings",
        "content": "What does the rotation out of tech mean for tech earnings?\n\nLast week began with investors continuing to rotate out of tech after a massive growth year thus far, and ended with a broader sell-off. With tech earnings on deck, that may change if results support the rich valuations for sported by many of those mega tech names. The Nasdaq fell 4% last week while the S&P 500 was down over 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended just about flat after rallying more than 700 points on Tuesday, its best day in over a year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nCurrently, S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology, two of the sectors taking the biggest hits last week (along with Consumer Discretionary), are expected to be the leaders of second-quarter earnings season. Investors may be waiting to see if earnings results will justify high price-earnings levels. With expectations so high, these names will likely have to put up healthy beats to impress shareholders.\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 earnings per share growth is for 9.70% year over year, an increase from 9.30% last week.[1] Thus far, 80% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 62% have beaten on revenue.[2]\n\nCEO uncertainty remains high\n\nAfter falling to its lowest level in its nine years in the first quarter of 2024, the Late Earnings Report Index, our proprietary measure of CEO uncertainty, is back up for the second quarter in a row for the third quarter.\n\nThe LERI tracks outlier earnings date changes among publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of $250 million and higher. The LERI has a baseline reading of 100, anything above that indicates companies are feeling uncertain about their current and short-term prospects. A LERI reading under 100 suggests companies feel they have a pretty good crystal ball for the near term.\n\nThe official pre-peak season LERI reading for the second quarter (data collected in the third quarter) stands at 161, well above the baseline reading, suggesting companies are feeling less certain about economic conditions than they were at the beginning of the year. Some of that uncertainty was evident in banking commentary made over the last couple of weeks. As of July 12, there were 66 late outliers and 37 early outliers. Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nBig tech on deck\n\nThis week we start to get results from several Magnificent Seven and other big tech names including: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). This comes just as investor's start to rotate out of these mega-cap winners into smaller names that they believe will benefit more greatly from interest rate cuts potentially coming as soon as next month.\n\nStory continues Investors Rotate Out of Tech Just Ahead of Big Tech Earnings\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nLate earnings date confirmation\n\nWhen a company is late to confirm their quarterly earnings date, it could be valuable information for current or prospective inventors to know.\n\nReleased in 2022, Wall Street Horizon's Confirmation Timing uses historical data to project an expected confirmation date and the normal range that enables the identification of:\n\nCompanies that have not yet confirmed an earnings date and are materially late compared to their historical trends and behaviors. Announced earnings dates in which the Confirmation Timing is materially earlier or later than the company's historical average of the same quarter.\n\nCompanies that tend to stall on confirming their earnings dates also tend to set later-than-usual earnings dates, which academic research has shown highly correlates to bad news being shared on the call.[3]\n\n??The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nIn recent years, Disney has confirmed its second-quarter earnings date around July 5 with a standard deviation of +/- 3.70 days. The company ended up confirming its second-quarter earnings date, Aug. 7 BMO, on July 18, which was 14 days past the mean confirmation day. While the earnings date itself is within the historical range of expected earnings dates, the delay in confirming that date could point to a hesitant management team.\n\nEarlier in the year Disney was embroiled in a proxy battle which ended in April as the entertainment behemoth fended off activist investor Nelson Peltz (Trades, Portfolio), who attempted to secure board seats. Following a vote at its annual shareholder meeting, the company announced the current Disney board would remain as is.[4]\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between July 22 and Aug. 16, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,445 companies anticipated to report. Thus far only 60% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000-plus global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data.

        "title": "Will Lower Software Revenues Impact IBM's Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 24, after the closing bell. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to have recorded lower revenues from the Software segment owing to weakness in the hybrid platform & solutions business. However, a strong focus on product innovation and the growing clout of watsonx.ai across various sectors is a tailwind.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nThe Software segment includes Hybrid Platform & Solutions comprising software services, Red Hat, automation and data & artificial intelligence (AI) businesses and Transaction Processing.\r\n\r\nDuring the second quarter, IBM introduced significant updates to Qiskit, its widely used quantum software platform. This enhancement is designed to maximize the performance of IBM's quantum hardware, allowing users to run increasingly complex quantum circuits.\r\n\r\nThe advanced feature in IBM\u2019s Qiskit stack includes The Qiskit Runtime Service, which simplifies the execution of quantum circuits, while the Qiskit Code Assistant, powered by watsonx-based generative AI models, automates the development of quantum code. Additionally, the Qiskit Serverless tool facilitates quantum-centric supercomputing workloads across both quantum and classical hardware. \r\n\r\nIBM is steadily advancing with its vision of integrating quantum, classical and AI resources into a new high-performance computing paradigm defined by quantum-centric supercomputing. The Qiskit solution is witnessing healthy market traction in various sectors, such as energy and education. These are likely to have supported the top line in the Software segment.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, All-England Lawn Tennis Club leveraged IBM\u2019s AI and data platform, watsonx, to introduce enticing AI native features to enrich the overall experience of tennis fans, coaches and players globally. A prominent marketing and advertising company based in the U.K. collaborated with IBM to introduce a new business-to-business (B2B) solution within the marketing industry. Leveraging IBM's cutting-edge AI technologies, including watsonx, the solution aims to address B2B marketing challenges and expedite digital transformation for business enterprises globally. These developments will likely have a favorable impact on net sales in the Software segment.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, IBM inked a definitive agreement to acquire HashiCorp Inc for an all-cash transaction of $35 per share, totaling an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. HashiCorp boasts a robust product suite that allows businesses to automate their hybrid and multi-cloud environments with extensive Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management capabilities. Integration of Hashicorp\u2019s capabilities is expected to drive synergies in multiple strategic growth areas such as IBM watsonx, Red HaT, IT automation and more. This will significantly strengthen IBM\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud approach and accelerate innovation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the persistence of uncertainty in some end markets stemming from macroeconomic headwinds remains a concern for this segment. Frequent acquisition exposes the company to integration risks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall Expectations\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Software revenues is pegged at $6.55 billion, indicating a decline from $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. However, our estimate for revenues from Software is pegged at $6.61 billion, suggesting a 5.1% improvement year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $15.58 billion. It generated revenues of $15.48 billion in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.16 per share, indicating decline from $2.18 in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for IBM for the second quarter.

        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide International Business Machines with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nHow Quickly Is International Business Machines Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that International Business Machines has managed to grow EPS by 36% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of International Business Machines shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 3.5% to 16% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of International Business Machines' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\n\nAre International Business Machines Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince International Business Machines has a market capitalisation of US$168b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$168m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of International Business Machines but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add International Business Machines To Your Watchlist?\n\nYou can't deny that International Business Machines has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for International Business Machines that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "New IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity Certificate and Data Analytics Certificates to be Deployed in Community College Systems across Alabama, California Bay Area, Colorado and Louisiana",
        "content": "Alabama Community College System, Bay Area Community College Consortium, Colorado Community College System, and Louisiana Community and Technical College System will offer students access through IBM SkillsBuild this fall Credentials have been piloted and designed with community college experts, and have ACE recommended college credits\n\nWASHINGTON, July 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled two new IBM SkillsBuild certificates in cybersecurity and data analytics, which have been piloted and designed with community colleges. These new IBM SkillsBuild certificates will be available to students across the Alabama Community College System, Bay Area Community College Consortium, Colorado Community College System, and Louisiana Community and Technical College System this fall. IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\nCybersecurity and data analytics skills are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, enabling professionals to extract insights, secure critical information, drive informed decisions, and create value across industries in an increasingly data-centric and security-conscious world. According to a global study conducted by IBM Institute of Business Value, executives estimate that implementing AI and automation will require 40% of their workforce to reskill over the next three years, mostly those in entry-level positions. This underscores the importance of creating public-private partnerships to help close the skills gap.\n\n\"Community colleges play a critical role in advancing the adoption of essential technology skills for the workforce,\" said Lydia Logan,\u00a0Vice President for Global Education and Workforce Development, IBM Corporate Social Responsibility. \"With these new credentials, IBM is helping learners gain the in-demand skills employers are seeking in a new AI-enabled workplace.\"\n\nThe certificates are designed to meet the needs of learners and have been developed with academic and industry experts. Community college programs can integrate them into existing curriculums for students to earn credits.\n\nDesigned to meet the needs of learners: These certificates are accessible for first-time degree seekers, upskillers, or career changers who hold a high school degree or GED, associate degree, or a bachelor's degree in a non-technical field. Self-paced, experiential learning across all levels helps effectively prepare learners for potential job opportunities such as junior information security analyst, network security technician, data visualization specialist, and entry-level marketing analyst. Developed together with academic and industry experts: Jobs for the Future (JFF) and a coalition of industry experts contributed to and validated the\u00a0new competency-based IBM SkillsBuild certificates to align coursework and learnings with current employer demand as well as trends and expectations in the market to maximize job opportunities for students upon completion. The experts included representatives from employers including banks and tech firms, as well as schools and education nonprofits nationwide. Integrate into existing community college programs for college credits: Each certificate learning plan is 60-65 hours in length and can be integrated into a community college's curriculum. The American Council on Education (ACE) has conducted a Learning Evaluation Review of the certificates and recommends 12 credits for completion of the IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity Certificate and 8 credits for the IBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics Certificate. The coursework also aligns with CompTIA SEC+ certification topics and skills and is recognized by potential employers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new certificates from IBM SkillsBuild require completion of the following courses:\n\nIBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity Certificate: governance, risk, compliance and data privacy, vulnerability management, system and network security, cloud security, security operations management, and incident response and system forensics.\n\nIBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics Certificate: data classification, data usability for organizations, inferential and descriptive statistics, data collection and analysis, data preparation for analysis, and data visualization and presentation.\n\nAdditionally,\u00a0students will have access to IBM SkillsBuild including other credentials and more than 1,000 free courses such as AI, sustainability, cybersecurity, data analytics, cloud computing, and workplace skills.\n\nThe new certificates were piloted successfully with students in Alabama, Colorado, California, and Louisiana in 2023.\n\n\"Alabama community college worked with IBM to pilot the Cybersecurity Certificate because of the strong need for entry-level competency-based credentials that help students start on a pathway for an IT career,\" said Dr. Courtney Monette, Special Programs Project Director, Alabama Community College System. \"In 2021, Alabama adopted a skills-based workforce training program called Mobilizing Alabama Pathways, or MAPs, that allows new and returning adult education and career pathway students an opportunity to earn a credential like the IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity or Data Analytics Certificate; thus building confidence and basic employability skills for all high demand high wage career clusters.\"\n\n\"Using the IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity credential for my two community education Cybersecurity Fundamentals courses that I piloted at Diablo Valley College during last fall and spring semesters, proved to be a rewarding experience for the student participants, for me, and for the college,\" said Richard Grotegut, Computer Network Technology Faculty at Diablo Valley College, part of the Contra Costa Community College District and a member of the Bay Area Community College Consortium. \"It confirmed the college's decision to offer the course as part of their academic offerings beginning this coming school year. The credential proved to be a very good entry-level introduction to cybersecurity. While most of the participants enhanced their academic credentials and are pursuing further study, several of the course \"career-changers\" used their success in the class to gain employment in technical support positions with local companies. The rich course content and approach, with a strong focus on oral and written communication skills, was a key factor in building the confidence that helped the students land those jobs.\"\n\n\"Front Range Community College is thrilled to have been selected as one of four colleges nationally to collaborate in designing and launching the new IBM SkillsBuild data analytics credential,\" said Colleen Simpson, EdD, Front Range Community College President. \"This collaboration with renowned technology leader IBM provides our students the opportunity to develop critical skill sets in this rapidly growing field.\"\n\n\"Baton Rouge Community College was excited to work with IBM in piloting this initiative last year,\" said BRCC Chancellor Dr. Willie E. Smith. \"We look forward to continuing this collaboration and working with IBM to expand the initiative and offer it to Louisiana citizens through the Louisiana Community and Technical College System. Through this collaboration, we are demonstrating a commitment to equipping our residents with the skills and practical experience required to excel in the high demand fields of cybersecurity and data analytics. Together, we are paving the way for Louisiana to emerge as a national leader in these rapidly growing sectors, ensuring our talent is prepared to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities of the future.\"\n\n\"In an increasingly dynamic economy shaped by fast-evolving technology, employers, learners, and workers need nimble and trusted ways to acquire and validate skills that will lead to quality jobs of the future,\" said Joel Vargas, Vice President of JFF's Education Practice. \"JFF is proud to work with IBM and these innovative colleges to lead the charge on creating scalable solutions to meet this growing need.\"\n\nIBM's work with community colleges is an important component of the company's pioneering skills-first approach and part of IBM's commitment to providing 30 million people with new skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow by 2030.\n\nAbout IBM SkillsBuild\n\nIBM SkillsBuild is a free education program aimed at increasing access to technology education.

        "title": "Biden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The volatile U.S. political situation took another turn, with President Joe Biden dropping out of race for re-election. China has attempted to boost its struggling economy but cutting interest rates, while Nvidia is developing an AI chip for the Chinese market.\n\n1. Biden bows out of presidential race; Harris to replace?\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday bowed to what seemed inevitable, and dropped out of the race for re-election amid concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden backed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the job, putting her in pole position for the nomination which is officially scheduled for the Democratic convention on Aug. 19-22.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis talk of unity could see the party consider a virtual nomination ahead of the convention, and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.\n\nGoldman Sachs in a note said they did not expect the Democrats' fiscal and trade policy agenda to shift meaningfully in the event that Harris is the nominee.\n\nHarris could consolidate Black support and bring into sharper focus the differences between the two sides on abortion rights, an issue that has proved significant in other polls.\n\nBut she also faces the full weight of history as she would become the first female and only the second black President, after Barack Obama.\n\n2. Futures edge higher, with tech earnings to the fore\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, bouncing after hefty losses as investors rotated out of the major technology stocks.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 23 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 125 points, or 0.6%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 2% and 3.7%, respectively, marking their biggest weekly losses since April. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%.\n\nThe evolving political situation will remain in focus Monday, but there are more important earnings to digest, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) feature in a busy week for earnings, kicking off results from the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are among some of the other big-name companies set to report during the coming week, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is set to report later Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia developing AI chip for Chinese market - Reuters\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a version of its flagship artificial intelligence chips for Chinese markets that will fall in line with U.S. export restrictions, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker will work with Inspur, one of its biggest distributors in China, on a chip tentatively called the \u201cB20,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s current AI offerings are geared specifically towards falling in line with U.S. export restrictions on China. But recent reports suggested that its offerings in the country, such as the H20, were seeing weak demand amid heavy competition from local chipmakers, specifically Huawei.\n\nIncreased interest in AI development has sparked a revenue bonanza for Nvidia, boosting the company\u2019s valuation to make it among the most valuable companies on Wall Street.\n\n4. PBOC cuts rates to boost the Chinese economy\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its benchmark loan prime rates further into record-low territory on Monday, in an attempt to support the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.35% from 3.45%, while the five-year LPR, which is used to determine mortgage prices, was cut to 3.85% from 3.95%.\n\nThe cuts come just a week after softer-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter ramped up concerns over slowing economic growth, increasing doubts that the central bank\u2019s full-year GDP growth target will be met.\n\nChinese officials had promised more stimulus during the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Third Plenum last week.\n\nSentiment surrounding Chinese markets remains weak though, amid speculation that Donald Trump will win a second term as U.S. president.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely negative stance towards China. His administration had imposed steep tariffs on China, sparking a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\n\nA second term for Trump could entail a similar scenario, which bodes poorly for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n5. Crude market to return to surplus next year - Morgan Stanley\n\nCrude prices rose Monday, boosted by a surprise Chinese interest rate cut [see above], which is aimed at boosting the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.2% to $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, have weighed on the market, especially following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThese gains may not last too long though, as although the crude market is currently tight, next year it will likely be in surplus, with Brent prices declining into the mid-to-high $70s range, Morgan Stanley said.\n\nThe tightness will hold for most of the third quarter, the bank said in a note dated on Friday, but equilibrium will return by the fourth quarter, \"when seasonal demand tailwinds abate and both OPEC and non-OPEC supply return to growth.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley said it expects OPEC and non-OPEC supply to grow by about 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, well ahead of demand growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets\n\nTaiwan June export orders miss forecast, China demand weakens\n\nChina to extend tariff exemptions for some US imports until 2025",

        "title": "1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy in July",
        "content": "In the ever-changing world of artificial intelligence (AI), International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is a solid front-runner. Big Blue combines a legacy of innovation with a forward-thinking approach to AI development and implementation -- and market makers haven't caught on to this massive AI investment opportunity yet.\n\nWith a focus on responsible AI, a thriving consulting business, and strong partnerships, IBM is poised to capitalize on growing demand for AI solutions while delivering solid returns to investors. It sure doesn't hurt that the stock is starting from a very modest valuation right now.\n\nMarket performance and valuation\n\nIBM has consistently outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the past year, but still lags behind the leading market index from a five-year perspective.\n\nWith a price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 13.0 and a price-to-sales ratio below 2.8, IBM presents a compelling valuation compared to other AI stocks, especially considering its strong dividend yield of 3.6%. Big Blue gives you the best of both worlds, pairing strong growth opportunities in the AI space with a really modest valuation.\n\nInnovation and accessibility through Watsonx\n\nLet's check out what IBM has been up lately to in terms of AI innovation.\n\nThis week, the company released the Mistral Large AI model on its Watsonx.ai platform. It is a large language model (LLM), in many ways comparable to OpenAI's GPT-4 engine and Alphabet's Gemini system. It is especially good at abstract reasoning based on complex input data, beating OpenAI's best LLM on benchmarks in this category.\n\nMistral Large is now a part of the IBM Granite AI development platform, alongside a plethora of IBM's highly specialized AI tools plus LLMs from Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. You won't find OpenAI's software here (yet), but IBM's broad portfolio of LLMs and machine learning systems should cover whatever AI needs your company might have. That's only more true after adding the highly capable Mistral service.\n\nThe Mistral inclusion further solidifies IBM's commitment to making advanced AI easily accessible to enterprises. This expansion helps IBM's client businesses to make the most of AI tools to drive their own innovation and growth.\n\nConsulting expertise and responsible AI\n\nIBM isn't just an AI innovator; it's a trusted AI advisor. The company's decades of expertise in consulting services comes in quite handy when technological progress throws a curveball at the entire business world, like the ongoing adoption of generative and general AI right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith their decades of deep AI expertise, IBM's consulting services act as a guiding hand for other businesses dealing with the complexities of the AI landscape. Whether it's crafting a tailored AI strategy aligned with specific business goals or providing hands-on support during AI implementation and beyond, IBM is there.\n\nThis comprehensive approach is a unique win-win situation. It not only generates revenue for IBM, but also nurtures lasting partnerships with clients who value their expertise and commitment to success. And you won't see the likes of Alphabet or Microsoft giving IBM much of a challenge in the realm of consulting services. It's not what they do, and their business processes are not set up to share their IT and business insights that way.\n\nBut IBM's dedication to AI doesn't stop at helping businesses adopt it. They're equally passionate about ensuring that AI is used responsibly, especially when it comes to training systems for generative AI functions. Their AI Ethics Board plays a vital role in this endeavor, acting as a vigilant guardian over the development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\nThis focus on transparency, fairness, and ethical practices is crucial in a world increasingly concerned about the potential misuse of AI. Thoughtless implementations can lead to lower AI data quality, heartless computerized replacement of creative human jobs, and more.\n\nBy prioritizing responsible AI, IBM establishes itself as a trustworthy and reliable partner for businesses navigating the ethical complexities of this transformative technology.\n\nTackling potential challenges in a competitive landscape\n\nWhile IBM demonstrates significant strengths in the AI market, it's important to consider potential challenges that could impact its future growth:\n\nLegacy business: While providing financial stability, the last vestiges of IBM's legacy businesses could hinder its agility in adapting to the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Competition: The AI market is highly competitive, with numerous well-funded players vying for market share. IBM needs to continuously innovate to maintain its edge.\n\nIBM's unique combination of established expertise, cutting-edge AI solutions like watsonx.ai, a thriving consulting business, and a strong commitment to responsible AI sets it apart in the AI landscape. A deceptively attractive valuation and consistent dividend payments further cement it as a top AI stock to buy in July.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Adobe (ADBE) Gains 17.7% in 3 Months: What Should You Do Now?",
        "content": "Adobe\u2019s ADBE investors have been enjoying some short-term gains from the stock of late. Its shares have rallied 17.7% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Software industry\u2019s return of 6.8% and the S&P 500\u2019s 10.4% growth.\r\n\r\nThe company is significantly benefiting from its strong generative AI capabilities. Its expanding AI-powered product portfolio has been a key catalyst in driving its top-line growth. The solid momentum of its family of creative, generative AI models, Firefly, which has been driving growth within the Digital Media and Digital Experience segments, is a major positive.\r\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s leading market position in the PDF category is a plus.\r\n\r\nADBE is trading at a significant discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 24.04X compared with the industry\u2019s 31.85X, making it a good opportunity for investors.\r\n\r\nIn second-quarter fiscal 2024, the Digital Media segment, comprising Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, witnessed 11% year-over-year growth, mainly driven by the strong adoption of Firefly-powered tools and the Acrobat ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Experience segment, comprising Adobe Experience Cloud, witnessed 9% year-over-year growth on the back of Adobe Experience Platform (\u201cAEP\u201d) powered by generative AI.\n\nADBE's Three Months Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Adobe expects Digital Media revenues between $15.80 billion and $15.85 billion. The Digital Experience segment\u2019s revenues are expected between $5.325 billion and $5.375 billion.\n\nExpanding Gen AI-Powered Solutions Aid Prospects\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the generative AI market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 36.5% between 2024 and 2030. Adobe is well-poised to capitalize on this growth prospect on the back of its strengthening generative AI-powered portfolio of solutions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s unveiling of the Firefly Image 2 Model, Firefly Vector Model and Firefly Design Model to mark a significant advancement in its creative generative AI model family, enhancing creative control, image quality and illustrator capabilities, is a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe company recently added features to Acrobat AI Assistant to allow customers to ask questions, get insights, and create content from information across groups of PDFs and other document types, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and text files. It also introduced enhanced meeting transcript capabilities in AI Assistant.\n\nAdobe also offers AEP AI Assistant, which is capable of answering technical questions, automating tasks, simulating outcomes and generating audiences seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Generative Remove in Adobe Lightroom, which is a powerful Firefly-backed tool that helps remove unwanted objects from any photo in a single click in a non-destructive manner, is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Adobe Express for Enterprise, which is powered by Firefly Image Model 3, is driving the company\u2019s momentum among various enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe company recently made Adobe Content Hub with Adobe Experience Manager (\u201cAEM\u201d) Assets generally available. This will enable various brands to manage several creative assets seamlessly with the power of generative AI-backed Content Hub.\r\n\r\nIn this booming generative AI era, Adobe faces strong competitive pressure from tech giants like Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms, which are continuously making advances to bolster their generative AI capabilities and Large Language Models.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Customer & Partner Bases Drive Growth\n\nA solid portfolio and differentiated approach to AI are attracting an expanding universe of customers across Adobe\u2019s segments.\r\n\r\nInternational Business Machines IBM is one of the notable customers leveraging Adobe Firefly. IBM was able to generate 200 campaign assets and more than 1,000 marketing variations in moments rather than months using Firefly models.\r\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s other key customer wins include Samsung, Comcast, Mercedes-Benz, ULTA Beauty, Maruti Suzuki, ServiceNow, AECOM, AstraZeneca, Chevron, Wells Fargo, Novo Nordisk, Berkshire Hathaway, FedEx, Infosys, Rakuten, Volvo, Ralph Lauren and U.S. Department of the Treasury. \r\nADBE\u2019s strategic partnerships with Microsoft and Alphabet are also shaping its growth trajectory by driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nThe integration of the Acrobat PDF technology into Microsoft Edge and Alphabet\u2019s Google Chrome is a plus. Adobe is experiencing rising free-to-paid conversions on the back of its Acrobat extensions for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. \r\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s recent partnership with Microsoft to provide marketing insights and workflows from Adobe Experience Cloud applications and Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Copilot in order to assist marketers in creative brief development, content creation and content approval management is noteworthy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough the intensifying generative AI battle and the negative impacts of geo-political tensions are risky, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its expanding generative AI-powered product portfolio and strength in Firefly.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nA strong partner base, expanding clientele, solid momentum in the PDF category, compelling product lines, continued innovation and a growing footprint in emerging markets should drive its top-line growth in the long run.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2024, Adobe projects total revenues between $21.4 billion and $21.5 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $21.45 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.5%.\n\nManagement expects non-GAAP earnings per share between $18.00 and $18.20. The consensus mark for fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $18.16 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.1% in the past seven days.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players\u2014Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)\u2014experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJer\u00f3nimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestl\u00e9 (NESNE.SW)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "The Most Liveable Country in Asia in 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Liveable Countries in Asia in 2024 and in this article, we will talk about the most liveable country in Asia in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, we are well aware of the consequences of climate change and hence, one of the most concerning factors that affect livability of a city is extreme heat as it increases discomfort and potentially also increases crime and traffic accidents, particularly in high humidity areas. Speaking of discomfort, the livability of cities in East Asia today is facing challenges due to extreme urban heat. In 2023, record-high temperatures exacerbated by climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) effect posed serious risks. On average, land surface temperatures in East Asian cities were 2.0\u00b0C warmer than nearby rural areas, with cities in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines experiencing up to 6.6\u00b0C higher temperatures. This disparity was particularly pronounced in poorer neighborhoods and is more severe at night due to heat retention by urban infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, according to the World Bank, over 100,000 deaths in East Asia are attributed to extreme heat annually. Economically, productivity losses from the UHI effect combined with global warming could reduce the GDP of major cities by 1.4-1.7% by 2050, with worst-case scenarios projecting an 11% loss by century's end. Speaking of GDP, let\u2019s look at the economic strength of Asia in general.\n\nThe Economic Strength of Asia in 2024\n\nIn 2024, Asia's economic growth is being fueled by tremendous developments in trade interconnectivity and technological innovation. Ccountries like India, China, and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are essentially leading this transformation. For example, we know that India's economy is expected to grow at 6.8% this year and its GDP is projected to surpass Japan's by 2025 and Germany's by 2030 and will eventually reach $7 trillion. On the other hand, China, despite a potential slowdown, is still projected to have a GDP $5 trillion higher in 2030 compared to 2022. Moreover, ASEAN's trade is anticipated to grow by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with exports increasing by nearly 90% by 2031.\n\nIt is also true that Asia's rise as a global tech and innovation hub is another important driver. The continent is becoming increasingly interconnected as manufacturing and sourcing are shifting to Southeast Asia with incredibly support provided by agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). By 2030, Asia\u2019s fintech revenues are expected to outpace those of North America. It is also worth highlighting that the region's consumers show a strong inclination toward artificial intelligence which also suggests near-term growth opportunities in tech sectors. Let\u2019s look at the recent developments of tech initiatives around Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Growing Focus of the Big Giants in Asia\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has recently announced a major initiative to equip 2.5 million people in ASEAN countries with AI skills by 2025 to support the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025. The initiative aims to build an AI-ready talent pool across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam and will involve partnerships with governments, nonprofit and corporate organizations. Over the past two years, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Skills4Jobs program has already reached 1.7 million participants in the region. The AI TEACH programs by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in Indonesia and Malaysia target vocational students, while Thailand's AI Skills for the AI-enabled Tourism Industry program aims to train 100,000 young entrepreneurs. Additionally, in the Philippines, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to equip 1 million K-12 students with AI and cybersecurity skills.\n\nOn the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) has also intensified its focus on social impact, particularly in the field of education and skill development for the region. In 2022, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 pledged to train 1 million women and girls in the Asia-Pacific region over five years as part of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Upskilling Initiative. This initiative was aimed at closing the gender gap in STEM fields and has already empowered nearly 650,000 women and girls through different educational programs. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 partnerships across the region, including collaborations with educational departments and organizations in Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, are central to this effort. The Most Livable Country in Asia in 2024\n\nIngus Kruklitis/Shutterstock.com\n\nIs the United Arab Emirates the Most Livable Country in Asia in 2024?\n\nIn order to identify the most livable countries in Asia in 2024, we utilized country ranking from the Human Development Index for the year 2022 and from the Numbeo\u2019s affordability index by Asian countries for the year 2023. We averaged the Asian countries\u2019 rankings for both these metrics and obtained an average rank to rank our list. The list is now presented in a descending order. Our methodology revealed that the UAE is indeed the most liveable country in Asia in 2024.\n\nThere are multiple major reasons that make the UAE such a preferred destination. First of all, the country has a tax-free income policy which is a major draw that allows residents to keep their entire earnings. This financial freedom is complemented by a stable economy diversified beyond oil which offers job opportunities across different sectors. Safety is another major factor as Dubai has one of the lowest crime rates globally.\n\nThe UAE has a population nearing 10 million which is predominantly composed of expatriates as the country provides a favorable standard of living. Economically, the UAE has rapidly evolved into one of the world's wealthiest countries within a span of just 50 years. With a high GDP per capita, driven largely by its oil reserves and strategic economic diversification efforts, the UAE has achieved impressive growth rates, averaging close to 4% annually since 2000.\n\nTo check out the extensive list of the most livable countries in Asia, please visit 20 Most Liveable Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best MBA programs; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +6.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 6.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.16 per share, indicating a change of -0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.33 indicates a change of +4.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $63.02 billion and $66.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +4.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Quantum computers, heralded for their unprecedented computational power, could soon possess the capability to breach the encryption systems that protect critical infrastructure, financial markets and personal bank accounts, according to a leading scientist.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance Future Focus, director of IBM Research at Zurich, Dr Alessandro Curioni, explained that quantum computers leverage subatomic particles for calculations, enabling them to perform tasks at speeds unattainable by today's traditional computers.\n\n\"As a result of the development of quantum computing, all our sensitive data will be exposed,\" Curioni said. The scientist then listed the types of sensitive data that could be in jeopardy, such as \"healthcare data and financial data.\" He also warned that even digital signatures on contracts could be forged.\n\nWhile the exact timeline remains uncertain, Curioni emphasised that once quantum computers achieve sufficient power, they will be capable of breaking current cryptographic technology. \"We do know that a quantum computing machine, probably before the end of the decade, will be powerful enough to break the standard cryptographic technology that is used today,\" he noted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Cash still king for illegal transactions, not crypto, says Chainalysis exec\n\nThis looming event, known as 'Q-Day,' signifies the moment when quantum computers can crack cryptographic keys. These keys are complex codes used to secure data, ensuring it remains accessible only to authorised users. The implications of such a breach are profound, threatening personal banking information, financial systems and national security by exposing protected government and infrastructure data.\n\nGlobal race for quantum supremacy\n\nCurioni pointed out that the race to develop the first powerful quantum computer is fierce, with significant investments from nations worldwide.\n\nWhen pressed on where in the world the first powerful quantum computer that can crack cryptographic technology could come from, Curioni said: \"it could come from any nation that invests enough in the development of this technology.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How will AI change the world of scamming? | The Crypto Mile\n\nHe cited a report that said out of all the nations vying to win the race for quantum computing supremacy, \"two countries show exponential investment in this area, the United States and China, where most of the developments are happening.\"\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has also alerted financial institutions about the potential cybersecurity risks that quantum computing could introduce. Recent data shows that 95% of respondents believe quantum computing will significantly impact cryptographic security, yet only 25% of firms are addressing this threat.\n\nDespite the looming risks, IBM (IBM) is proactively developing solutions to safeguard current systems. Curioni highlighted the creation of Quantum-Safe cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand quantum computer attacks. These advancements are part of a broader effort to ensure data security in the quantum era.\n\nQuantum computing potential\n\nBeyond the security concerns, Curioni highlighted the transformative potential of quantum computing.

        "title": "Should You Bet on IBM Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings Release?",
        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 earnings on Jul 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings is pegged at $15.58 billion and $2.16 per share, respectively. Earnings estimates for IBM have declined marginally from $9.90 per share to $9.89 for 2024 but are up from $10.32 per share to $10.33 for 2025 over the past 30 days.\n\nIBM Estimate Trend Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Surprise History\n\nThe cloud and data platform delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.2%, on average, beating estimates on each occasion. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.7%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for IBM for the second quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is perfectly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIBM currently has an ESP of +0.46% with a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping Upcoming Results\n\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive.\u00a0 Leveraging the combination of Generative AI and large language models in the Watsonx platform, IBM introduced several enticing features during the quarter to the premier golf championship of the Masters Tournament\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nIt also collaborated with The All-England Lawn Tennis Club to introduce Generative AI technology in the Wimbledon tournament to enrich the overall experience of tennis fans, coaches and players globally. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the Consulting segment.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Consulting segment is pegged at $5.33 billion, while our model projects revenues of $5.37 billion.\r\n\r\nDuring the reported quarter, IBM announced significant updates to Qiskit, its widely used quantum software platform. These enhancements provide IBM Quantum Network members with the most advanced tools to discover new quantum algorithms. As users seek to achieve quantum advantage \u2014 where quantum computers outperform classical ones \u2014 Qiskit\u2019s comprehensive stack is pivotal. The platform supports mapping problems for efficient execution on quantum hardware, optimizing these problems and executing them effectively, bridging the gap between classical and quantum computation. These are likely to have translated into incremental revenues in the Software segment.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Software segment is pegged at $6.56 billion, while our model projects revenues of $6.61 billion.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM is facing stiff competition from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSFT Azure. The company\u2019s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is a challenging task. Weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nOver the past year, IBM has gained 38.5% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 25.9%. It has also outperformed its peers like Microsoft and Oracle Corporation ORCL over this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Valuation Metric\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, IBM appears to be trading at a premium relative to the industry and is trading well above its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 18.51 forward earnings, higher than 18.08 for the industry and the stock\u2019s mean of 12.54. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Considerations\n\nIBM expects its growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability. IBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, IBM\u2019s frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks. Buyouts have negatively impacted the company\u2019s balance sheet in the form of high level of goodwill and net intangible assets. IBM\u2019s margins are likely to be strained by limited cost-cutting opportunities and stiff competitive pressures, likely delaying key product launches.\n\nEnd Note\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #3, IBM appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. It is also trading at premium valuation metrics and investors could wait for a better entry point to cash in on its long-term fundamentals. With declining earnings estimates, the stock is witnessing a negative investor perception. Consequently, it might not be a prudent decision to bet on the stock at the moment.\r\n\r\nHowever, a single quarter\u2019s results are not so important for long-term stakeholders and investors already owning the stock could stay put. In addition, the increasing propensity of business enterprises to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to secure multi-cloud management with a diligent focus on hybrid cloud and AI solutions will likely reap long-term benefits.\n\nA better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities are expected to be conducive to long-term growth. These, in turn, offer some enticing reasons for continuing to invest in the stock over a long-term horizon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "I\u2019ll always advocate for blue-chip stocks as an ideal holding to anchor an investment portfolio. Blue chips provide many benefits that you won\u2019t find elsewhere in the market. But when you\u2019re looking for some names to fit the bill, it\u2019s important to focus on top-rated blue-chip stocks that will give you a better chance for success.\n\nBlue-chip stocks represent companies that are well-established, financially sound, and at the top of their respective industries. When you\u2019re investing in blue-chip stocks, you can usually rely on the companies to provide consistent earnings and a solid financial base. Many blue-chip stocks also pay a reliable dividend as well.\n\nI also like the growth potential offered by top-rated blue-chip stocks. While it\u2019s more difficult to substantially grow a business that\u2019s already sporting a large market cap and is at the top of the field, it\u2019s certainly possible.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop-rated blue-chip stocks can sometimes offer the same dynamic growth that you can find in smaller companies that are favored by investors seeking growth.\n\nWe\u2019re using the Portfolio Grader to screen for and identify the best top-rated blue-chip stocks in the market.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on a variety of factors such as earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum to calculate an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d grade. All the names on this list score a coveted \u201cA\u201d rating, meaning that they are the best of the best when it comes to blue-chip names.\n\nAdding one or more of these top-rated blue-chip stocks will give you a solid foundation for your portfolio that balances risk and reward to help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) breaks all the rules \u2013 despite a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia still shows all the characteristics of a dynamic growth stock, thanks to its industry-leading position with generative artificial intelligence.\n\nEstimates are that Nvidia provides anywhere from 80% to 90% of the high-powered graphics processing units needed to run the most advanced generative AI programs.\n\nAs these GPUs cost tens of thousands of dollars apiece, Nvidia\u2019s profits have been soaring ever since companies realized that AI offerings are a must-have for any tech company.\n\nThat\u2019s how the company was able to show year-over-year revenue growth of 262% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, coming in at $26.04 billion. Operating income was $16.9 billion, up 690% from a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.98 was up 629% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock Investment Institute strategist Wei Li believes that investments in AI data centers to increase 60% to 100% in the coming years, giving Nvidia plenty of room for continued growth. While there may be some short-sellers who believe Nvidia\u2019s runway is short, I\u2019m betting on NVDA to continue to expand.\n\nNVDA stock is up 155% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a dynamic growth story of its own. The company\u2019s Google search engine has a near monopoly on global search traffic with an estimated 91%, giving it unmatched potential to capture the lucrative online advertising market.\n\nGoogle search brought in $46.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up from $40.3 billion a year ago. Alphabet also saw strong growth in YouTube advertising ($8.09 billion, up from $6.63 billion a year ago). For the quarter, Google advertising accounted for $61.6 billion of the company\u2019s $80.5 billion in revenue.\n\nTake note, however, that Alphabet has pulled out of its discussed acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) \u2013 a deal that, had it been complete, would have helped Alphabet increase its business software revenue and cloud revenue. But notably investors haven\u2019t punished GOOG stock for the failure of that venture.\n\nConsidering that Alphabet has more than $108 billion in cash on hand, it shouldn\u2019t have any trouble finding another partner should it want to grow the business through an acquisition. It just needs to find the right deal that makes sense for shareholders \u2013 obviously, the HubSpot deal wasn\u2019t it.\n\nGOOG stock is up 31% this year. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another Big Tech company that is using its advertising power to bring in billions in revenue each quarter. While Alphabet has a near-monopoly with internet search, Meta Platforms has a dominant social media presence and reams of information about its users that lets advertisers target messages to specific audiences.\n\nMeta reported that 3.24 billion people on average used its products in the first quarter, up 7% from a year ago. As advertising impressions increased by 20% from a year ago and the average price per ad was up 6%, Meta Platforms saw a huge 27% increase in revenue, bringing in $36.4 billion versus $28.6 billion a year ago.\n\nMeta also offers Meta AI, its generative AI-powered assistant, which can help people create and modify projects and images on the company\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms.\n\nMETA stock is up 39% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been called Big Blue since the 1980s, a tribute to its blue color scheme on signs and on the company\u2019s displays and cases in the 20th century. But I think it could better be called \u201cBig Blue Chip\u201d based on its track record of being one of the best blue-chip stocks you can buy for generations.\n\nIBM traces its history back for generations, all the way to punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s. It was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nToday, Big Blue offers the Watson AI engine and the Watsonx generative AI platform to its enterprise customers. It\u2019s one of the top cloud infrastructure providers in the world.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter earnings included revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 69%. And earnings per share of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM stock is up 13% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is another legacy tech company that is finding new ways to compete in the 21st century. Dell is best known as a manufacturer of computers, laptops and mobile devices, but the company is also working in AI by operating a large server business that allows companies to upgrade their hardware to run AI applications.\n\nDell is expected to be a major player in the AI space for years to come. It\u2019s building and selling servers that include Nvidia\u2019s highly prized H100 GPU and Blackwell-generation chips. Dell\u2019s backlog of orders for its AI servers increased 30% during the first quarter to $3.8 billion. AI server sales rose 42% to $5.5 billion.\n\nDell is also working with Nvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI artificial intelligence company to build xAI\u2019s supercomputer and power the Grok chatbot.\n\nDell\u2019s AI offerings will be a catalyst for many quarters to come. The stock is up 75% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is perhaps the best streaming service on the planet. Only Alphabet\u2019s YouTube, which offers free streaming, has a greater reach than Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe have built a hard to replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix,\u201d the company said in its first-quarter earnings report. \u201cImprovement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business.\u201d\n\nNetflix is reporting Q2 earnings after the closing bell on July 18. Investors should be looking for revenue growth (up 15.9% in the first quarter from a year ago), global streaming paid memberships (up 16% in Q1) and global streaming paid net additions (up 9.3%).\n\nIf Netflix can continue to show improvement on those numbers, thanks to its relatively new strategy to end password sharing, then Netflix stock will continue its ascent.\n\nNFLX stock is up 34% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer on the planet, boasting more than 10,800 locations that includes every U.S. state and two dozen countries.\n\nI also appreciate that Walmart is aggressively growing its e-commerce business. Considering its footprint, why pay another company to ship and deliver its goods to customers who want to order online when there\u2019s business there ripe for the taking? It\u2019s better for Walmart to do it itself.\n\nWalmart also is investing heavily in drone delivery. Since launching drone delivery in 2021, the company has completed more than 30,000 unmanned deliveries.\n\nWalmart is also working on bridging the drone service, where available, with the Walmart app \u2013 customers who order online will be notified if they are eligible for drone delivery. While there are still regulatory hurdles to clear, I appreciate that Walmart is looking for avenues forward to make the company more profitable.\n\nWMT stock is up 33% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a LONG position in NVDA.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "title": "Will IBM (IBM) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering IBM (IBM), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry.\n\nThis technology and consulting company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.02%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, IBM came out with earnings of $1.68 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share, representing a surprise of 5.66%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.78 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.87 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.38%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for IBM. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nIBM has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 24, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is looking beyond the obvious megacap stocks to find the next leg of the artificial intelligence trade.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry Nasdaq 100 Set for Worst Day Since December 2022: Markets Wrap BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\n\nBetting that the Magnificent Seven may be running out of steam after an 18-month rally, some investors are turning their attention to what Melius Research dubbed \u201cAI laggards.\u201d This group, which includes Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and International Business Machines Corp., have exposure to the AI theme but failed to keep up with gains for the biggest AI winners in the first half of the year.\n\nAll three have outperformed over the past month, while AI poster child Nvidia Corp. has slightly dropped in that period. Chip stocks broadly fell Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration is considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies continue giving China access to advanced chip technology, although Intel rose 6.6%.\n\nIBM shares swung between gains and losses in early trading Wednesday, after five days of gains.\n\nCrucially, the laggards also have lower valuations and bars to clear in terms of sentiment and earnings expectations, suggesting they could be well positioned for the rest of 2024.\n\n\u201cWe are believers in a \u2018catch-up\u2019 trade for some in semis, hardware and even software \u2014 those with lower expectations,\u201d Melius analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note this month, adding that a similar pattern occurred in 2023, when first half \u201cunderdogs\u201d did well in the second half.\n\nReitzes also included Apple Inc. on his list of stocks that underperformed in the first six months. Shares in the iPhone maker have been rising steadily since April, preceding the rotation into other laggards, but have been especially strong since Apple demonstrated long-awaited new AI features last month.\n\nTed Mortonson, a technology desk sector strategist at Baird, said investors are starting to rotate into stocks where fundamentals are strong but expectations are lower, leaving more room for upside.\n\n\u201cThe obvious AI stocks have doubled over the past year and are facing slower growth from here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to think they\u2019re over-owned and that there might be a catch up in names that have been overlooked.\u201d\n\nMortonson highlighted other stocks he sees as beneficiaries of the trade, including software company F5 Inc., electronic measurement instruments company Keysight Technologies Inc., and semiconductor-related firms Diodes Inc., Coherent Corp., Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Aehr Test Systems, which on Tuesday gave a positive outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rotation is coming after a first half which saw megacaps including Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. propel the market higher, stretching valuations for these names and leaving them with a tougher setup for the rest of 2024. Citigroup analysts recently suggested investors take profits in some high-flying AI stocks and \u201cre-balance toward a broader array of AI stocks across the value chain.\u201d\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to decelerate next year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. At the same time, AI winners like Nvidia and Microsoft are trading at substantial premiums to their long-term multiples \u2014 making laggards like IBM and Intel look like bargains in comparison.\n\nIBM\u2019s second-quarter results next week will be an important datapoint to determine whether this trade can continue. Last quarter, weak sales from the company\u2019s consulting unit sparked the biggest one-day drop in more than two years. While megacap stocks have been hitting record after record this year, IBM hasn\u2019t hit one since 2013.\n\n\u201cEveryone owns the growth tech stocks, but the value side has been neglected at a time when the macro cycle should be pretty favorable,\u201d said Ohsung Kwon, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a trade to be made within tech, since positioning has gotten pretty extreme.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe recent strength in small-cap stocks includes tech, with the category trouncing its larger equivalent of late. An index tracking small-cap tech jumped 3% on Tuesday, its biggest one-day gain since December, even as the large-cap tech index fell 0.4%. While large-cap remains the decisive outperformer this year, the past month has favored smaller names. The small-cap tech index is up more than 10%, compared with a 3.8% rise for large-caps.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration, facing pushback to its chip crackdown on China, has told allies that it\u2019s considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV continue giving the country access to advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nASML shares fell as the prospect of more severe US restrictions on its business in China offset growth in the Dutch firm\u2019s order intake last quarter. Elon Musk said he will relocate the headquarters for X and SpaceX to Texas, adding more fuel to the billionaire\u2019s efforts to align himself with the political right and distance himself from left-leaning California. Tesla Inc. forming an autonomous taxi platform will be the catalyst for a roughly 10-fold increase in its share price, Ark Investment Management LLC\u2019s Cathie Wood said, echoing years of bullish predictions about a business the carmaker has yet to stand up. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s marketing portal for merchants crashed Tuesday night, according to multiple Amazon sellers and consultants, fouling up one of the online retailer\u2019s biggest sales of the year. GitLab Inc., a US software developer backed by Google parent Alphabet Inc., is exploring a sale after attracting interest from potential bidders, Reuters reported.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. IBM (IBM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.17 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on July 24, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $2.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.16 Zacks Consensus Estimate, IBM has an Earnings ESP of 0.46%.\n\nIBM is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Twilio (TWLO).\n\nSlated to report earnings on August 1, 2024, Twilio holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.73 a share 15 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nTwilio's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.34% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.71.\n\nIBM and TWLO's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Five-year contract with $26 million in initial funding focuses on developing effective cybersecurity systems, procedures, and technology solutions\n\nWASHINGTON, July 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0IBM (NYSE: IBM)\u00a0today announced that it has secured a five-year contract with $26 million in initial funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to support its Cybersecurity Protection and Response (CPR) program aimed to expand and enhance the agency's cybersecurity response support for host governments in the Europe and Eurasia (E&E) region.

        "title": "Is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Among the Best Stocks for Dividends Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Stocks For Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks underperformed compared to the overall market, which was driven largely by tech stocks. As we move into the latter half of 2024, dividend stocks have shown a similar performance trend in the first half of the year. The Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, is down by 0.17% year-to-date, compared with a nearly 18% gain in the broader market. Dividend stocks are declining for two main reasons. First, high interest rates are drawing investors towards bonds instead. Second, the current surge in AI technology is capturing investors' focus on tech stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has achieved its all-time high this year, surging by over 25% so far in 2024. That said, investors haven't completely lost faith in dividend stocks. When all is said and done, successful investing is about playing the long game. Dividend stocks have consistently delivered, accounting for 36% of the market's total return since 1927. Bank of America has also declared 2024 as \u2018the year of dividends\u2019.\n\nIn dividend investing, dividend growth stocks often take a lead over high-yield dividend stocks. Recent research indicates that companies providing consistent and sustainable dividends, without excessive payouts, have delivered the best long-term returns. Wellington Management conducted a study that categorized dividend-paying companies into five groups based on their payout levels. Since 1930, the research found that stocks with the highest dividend payouts generally performed similarly to those with high, but not the very highest, payouts, although they frequently traded places as the top performers over the decades.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nThe dividend growth strategy has become so prominent over the years that many companies in the US are steadily increasing their payouts. In 2023, dividend payments reached an all-time high and have consistently increased over the years. Analysts are very optimistic about dividend payments for 2024, and recent projections indicate that the companies are on course to meet this new target record. One of the key reasons for this growth is that many companies, especially large technology firms, have abundant cash reserves and are rapidly increasing their free cash flows. This strong financial position enables them to continue rewarding their investors with higher dividend payments. According to the latest report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, companies in the index paid $153.4 billion in dividends in the second quarter of 2024, up from $151.6 billion from the previous quarter and up from $143.2 billion in the same period last year. The report also mentioned that there were 539 reported dividend increases, compared to 460 in the prior-year period, marking a 17.2% year-over-year rise. The total amount of these dividend increases reached $20.4 billion for the quarter, up from $9.8 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend growth stocks are a hit with investors because they have rock-solid businesses, a steady cash flow, and strong balance sheets. These companies are top-notch for generating passive income. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron\u2019s, and Business Insider. From their latest articles, we gathered the stocks they collectively favored. Additionally, we assessed the sentiment of hedge funds for each stock using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in these companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), or Big Blue, is a New York-based multinational technology company that offers a wide range of related services and products. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share, growing it by 0.6% in April this year. Through this increase, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 29 years, which makes IBM one of the best stocks for dividends. The stock's dividend yield on July 15 came in at 3.63%.\n\nWith AI being the biggest investment theme in 2024, investors are flocking to companies offering AI-related services and products in any form. Analysts suggest that companies developing AI applications specifically tailored to particular industries and their business needs are likely to be better investments. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is grabbing all the attention in this context. The company is currently the only provider offering a full technology stack through its Watsonx platform, along with consulting services for implementing and managing generative AI. The stock did not experience strong returns over the past decade, but due to its potential in the AI field, it is delivering strong returns this year. Since the start of 2024, IBM has gained roughly 14% and its 12-month returns came in at over 37%.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reported revenue of $14.4 billion, which showed a 1.5% growth from the same period last year. The company attributed the growth to the strength of its hybrid cloud and AI strategy. To further strengthen these segments, it has announced the acquisition of HashiCorp, a deal that is currently pending approval. The company is optimistic about AI driving future growth. In Q1 2024, its Watsonx platform and generative AI business have displayed consistent momentum, showing growth every quarter and surpassing $1 billion in revenues since Watsonx launched in mid-2023. For FY24, the company expects revenue to align with its mid-single-digit growth model and anticipates generating approximately $12 billion in free cash flow.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was a part of 49 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q1 2024, compared with 50 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes held by these hedge funds have a collective value of over $1 billion.\n\nOverall IBM ranks 14th on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Stocks For Dividends to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM, in collaboration with Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. JLL, recently launched a new sustainability solution, aimed at bolstering Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting within the commercial real estate (CRE) sector. This initiative is set to address the rising demand for transparent and accurate ESG data, which has become increasingly crucial for investors and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nLeveraging IBM\u2019s cutting-edge Envizi technology in data analytics and management, along with its deep expertise in real estate services, JLL will likely help organizations capture and manage data across real estate portfolios for swift decision-making process and public reporting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this collaboration will also likely give CRE organizations a thorough understanding of ESG metrics such as energy consumption, carbon footprint and waste management practices.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) closed the latest trading day at $182.88, indicating a +0.03% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.28% gain on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.53%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.4%.\n\nShares of the technology and consulting company witnessed a gain of 8.05% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 4.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of IBM in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on July 24, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.17, down 0.46% from the prior-year quarter. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $15.58 billion, showing a 0.67% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.90 per share and a revenue of $63.04 billion, signifying shifts of +2.91% and +1.91%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. As of now, IBM holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, IBM is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.47. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.14, so one might conclude that IBM is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt's also important to note that IBM currently trades at a PEG ratio of 4.51. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.54.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 108, placing it within the top 43% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "HPE or IBM: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Computer - Integrated Systems sector have probably already heard of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and IBM (IBM). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IBM has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that HPE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nHPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.08, while IBM has a forward P/E of 18.47. We also note that HPE has a PEG ratio of 2.54. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 4.51.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for HPE is its P/B ratio of 1.27. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IBM has a P/B of 7.20.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to HPE's Value grade of A and IBM's Value grade of C.\n\nHPE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than IBM, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HPE is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM) investors will be pleased with their respectable 42% return over the last year",
        "content": "The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. To wit, the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) share price is 36% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 22% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 33% in the last three years.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nInternational Business Machines was able to grow EPS by 293% in the last twelve months. This EPS growth is significantly higher than the 36% increase in the share price. So it seems like the market has cooled on International Business Machines, despite the growth. Interesting.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt is of course excellent to see how International Business Machines has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this freeinteractive graphic.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for International Business Machines the TSR over the last 1 year was 42%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that International Business Machines shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 42% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 10% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for International Business Machines that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

        "content": "CHICAGO, July 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE:IBM) and JLL (NYSE:JLL)\u00a0today announced a sustainability solution powered by IBM Envizi technology and delivered by JLL's sustainability services team, available globally.\n\nJLL's Sustainability Program Management, which provides sustainability services, such as decarbonization strategies to the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, will now be underpinned by ESG reporting and data management software in the form of the\u00a0IBM Envizi ESG Suite.\n\nThe solution is designed to help address the challenges organizations in the CRE sector are facing, such as capturing and managing data across real estate portfolios for decision-making and public reporting. According to a research report provided by JLL, \"The green tipping point\", while some corporate lease demand is already shifting based on ESG requirements, the next 12 to 24 months will bring widespread change. By 2025, 30% of market demand for low carbon office space will not be met \u2013 creating a tipping point for net zero carbon target penetration in lease markets.1\n\nHowever, across organizations, the integration of ESG metrics into core functions is limited. The IBM Institute for Business Value report, \"The ESG Data Conundrum\", showed that only 20% of respondents are integrating ESG metrics into supply chain operations; 26% into procurement and sourcing; and just 11% of those surveyed, into real estate and facilities management2. It follows that in order to address their sustainability goals companies must increase this integration. In fact, according to the IBM Institute for Business Value report, \"Beyond Checking The Box\", those organizations that\u00a0operationalize sustainability are 52% more likely to outperform their peers on profitability, and enjoy a 16% higher rate of revenue growth3. In this scenario, one way to achieve these results is through the help of robust data management and reporting platforms.\n\nJLL recognizes the importance of data management and reporting software\u00a0to support their clients' sustainability strategies, and IBM Envizi is a critical\u00a0part of the JLL Sustainability Program Management solution.\u00a0The initial roll out will offer thousands of JLL clients' sites the opportunity to onboard to the IBM Envizi software.\n\nGuy Grainger, Global Head of Sustainability Services at JLL, said: \"As ESG reporting requirements are increasingly mandated, our clients rely on us to help deliver decarbonization strategies across their portfolios. We identified IBM Envizi as our preferred solution that will allow our expansive team of sustainability subject matter experts to provide more robust reporting and data management around these strategies.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKendra DeKeyrel, Vice President of ESG and Asset Management at IBM, said: \"Now more than ever, organizations need ESG data to underpin their sustainability performance initiatives and reporting. We look forward to working with JLL to enable their customer base with our AI-infused, specialized software to meet their evolving business needs.\"\n\nTo learn more about IBM Sustainability, please visit www.ibm.com/sustainability.

        "content": "'Nvidia Is Slowly Becoming The IBM Of The AI Era' Says Former AMD And Tesla Engineer. Here's The Problem With That Comparison\n\nJim Keller, a well-known engineer who\u2019s worked at AMD and Tesla and now leads the AI company Tenstorrent, recently said something interesting on the DemystifySci podcast. He thinks Nvidia is becoming like IBM back in the day but in the AI world. While this shows how powerful Nvidia is right now in AI hardware, it also raises some concerns.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with low minimum investment.\n\nNvidia\u2019s smart move to focus on AI early has paid off big time \u2014 its earnings were over $26 billion in the first quarter of 2024. It\u2019s also one of the top three companies in the world by market valuation, breathing down the necks of Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe company is now a major player in the AI hardware market, with its powerful GPUs used by tech giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. It seems that everyone is on the Nvidia hype train, as CEO Jensen Huang calls AI the \"next industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia at the center.\n\nKeller, an extremely accomplished engineer and entrepreneur, knows what he\u2019s talking about. However, he might not realize just how unfortunate his comment that \"Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era\" is.\n\nIn the early 1980s, IBM was huge in the personal computer market. Their PCs were everywhere, and saying \"PC\" often meant you were talking about an IBM machine. But, IBM\u2019s reign didn\u2019t last long because of a few key mistakes and growing competition.\n\nTrending: Sun Belt's booming real estate market prepares for millions of new inhabitants \u2014 Here\u2019s how to find the region's best deals!\n\nIBM\u2019s strategy of using an open architecture helped it dominate the market initially, but it also made it easy for other companies to make IBM-compatible PCs. These competitors sold similar products at lower prices, which ate into IBM's market share.\n\nThe partnership between IBM and Microsoft also backfired as Bill Gates\u2019 company retained the rights to sell its operating system (MS-DOS) to other companies, paving the way for the rise of Microsoft Windows.\n\nAs PC Gamer reports, as Windows became the dominant operating system, PCs became more associated with Microsoft than IBM. IBM\u2019s slow adaptation to market changes and sticking to old business models allowed competitors to gain a foothold. By the 1990s, IBM's PC business was struggling, and in 2005, IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo, leaving the personal computer market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Many are surprised that they are eligible for a tax reduction on their home, with just a few seconds you can see if you can save in 3 minutes or less.\n\nNvidia could run into similar problems. As more companies start making AI hardware, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs might get cheaper because of the competition. Technology moves fast, so today\u2019s best chips can become outdated quickly. As Nvidia keeps growing, it could face more competition and rules to follow, just like IBM did.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s the $600 billion AI question. As Analyst David Chan from Sequoia writes, there\u2019s a big gap between the money being spent on AI infrastructure and the revenue AI is actually bringing in.\n\nAI companies need to make about $600 billion a year to earn enough to cover these huge investments.\n\nChan said the gap was \"only\" $200 billion in September 2023. Even though Nvidia is making a lot of money, the rest of the AI market isn\u2019t growing fast enough.\n\nKeller\u2019s comparison to IBM is both a compliment and a warning because Nvidia's success now doesn\u2019t guarantee its future. After all, the tech world is full of once market-leading companies that didn\u2019t keep up with changes.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "Good morning!\n\nThere are growing pains in every business transformation\u2014and IBM is no exception.\n\nAs a frontrunner in the AI race, the firm has invested in and implemented AI for client companies and among its own workforce. Because of its tech chops, IBM has been experimenting with AI longer than most businesses, rolling out chatbots and copilots for more than 10 years, according to the company. The organization now has more than 280 unique AI mechanisms solely within its HR function.\n\nBut there was a steep learning curve.\n\nNickle LaMoreaux, chief human resources officer at IBM, tells Fortune that back in 2017 the company introduced benefits assistant chatbot AskHR to staffers. It was built to address workers\u2019 questions and reduce the need for HR leaders or employees to parse through long company manuals to find the right answer.\n\n\u201cWhen we started on this journey, we started on it as a technical change. \u2018Here's this technical tool.\u2019 And what happened was nobody used it. The technology was there, the tool was there, but behavior wasn't there,\u201d she says.\n\nFaced with worker apathy, the company decided to force employees to use AskHR. In 2018, IBM told its 21,000 frontline managers that HR staff would no longer assist them with inquiries\u2014they would now have to use the AI chatbot to get their questions answered.\n\nBut worker satisfaction with the HR department plummeted. That prompted people leaders to radically switch up their strategy.\n\nIBM\u2019s HR professionals started listening to employee feedback, and implemented a new strategy to influence employee behavior by gradually asking workers to optimize their days with the tech, like asking the chatbot to answer policy questions or roleplay conversations with managers on performance evaluations. Today, the department\u2019s satisfaction score is leaps and bounds higher than it was before any AI rollout, and AskHR is widely used among staffers; it handles 94% of inquiries and 10.1 million HR-related interactions per year. Despite addressing most employee issues, LaMoreaux says the chatbot will direct staffers to consult an HR leader if they bring up sensitive issues like low performance or misconduct.\n\n\u201cMost people say don't experiment in HR,\u201d she says. \u201dBut we are now moving our AskHR to generative AI. That allows us to trade faster, the natural language is a lot better, and it's giving us better outcomes.\u201d\n\nYou can read my full story here.\n\nEmma Burleigh\r\nemma.burleigh@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The CHRO of IBM reveals what went wrong with their initial AI chatbot rollout\u2014and how they shifted strategies",
        "content": "In the footrace to roll outAI within the workforce, companies are bound to slip up along the way.\n\nIBM has been open about its dedication to build, implement, and scale company-wide AI, and over the past decade the company has built 280 different AI mechanisms within HR alone. But that doesn\u2019t mean the tech giant hasn\u2019t had a few hiccups getting there. When the company first introduced its benefits assistant chatbot, AskHR, to staffers back in 2017, it was not a runaway hit.\n\n\u201cWhen we started on this journey, we started on it as a technical change. \u2018Here's this technical tool,\u2019\u201d Nickle LaMoreaux, chief human resources officer at IBM, tells Fortune. \u201cAnd what happened was nobody used it. The technology was there, the tool was there, but behavior wasn't there.\u201d\n\nShe says staffers weren\u2019t ready for that change back then\u2014especially when the company\u2019s strategy was more calculated than cordial. When IBM realized its workforce wasn\u2019t going to start using AskHR willingly, leaders brought down the hammer. In 2018, the company told more than 20,000 workers that they were spending too much time on busywork, and that rather than ask the HR department questions as usual, they would have to use the chatbot instead.\n\nThat didn\u2019t make staffers happy. Before that moment, IBM\u2019s HR department had an employee CSAT score\u2014which measures an individual\u2019s satisfaction\u2014of +19, on a scale from -100 to +100. But within that first year after the firm required workers to use AskHR, HR\u2019s CSAT rating plummeted to -35.\n\nThat was a wake up call.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to force the behavior change, but we thought about it from the perspective of the HR team,\u201d says LaMoreaux. In the pursuit of eliminating busywork, they force fed employees a tool they weren\u2019t comfortable with. \u201cThere's a manager on the other end that says: \u2018You want me to type into a chatbot?\u2019 And again, this was 2018. So we started asking managers directly: \u2018How could the chatbot be better? What do you like about it?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat staffers most enjoyed about AskHR, according to LaMoreaux, was that they could ask questions in real time and with customized responses. The chatbot could automatically synthesize a worker\u2019s career data to point them to the policies that were most relevant to them. Previously, they would have to sift through dense employee manuals to find what they\u2019re looking for. After listening to what employees really wanted, LaMoreaux says IBM tweaked AskHR to make everything even more direct, instantaneous, and personalized. The company developed the chatbot to create more concise and digestible answers, assist job transfers to get staffers into their desired positions quicker, and roleplay nerve-wracking conversations like performance evaluations.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBy taking that feedback from them, being centered to who your end user is, that's what then got us out,\u201d she says, referencing HR\u2019s then-low employee satisfaction score. \u201cAnd now our score is consistently high.\u201d\n\nToday, the CSAT score for the HR team is in the +80s\u2014a huge leap from the worker dissatisfaction it grappled with before. AskHR has now evolved to handle 94% of employee queries and resolves around 10.1 million interactions per year for the HR department, according to the company. And while it handles the vast majority of questions, LaMoreaux says that the chatbot will direct workers to arrange a meeting with an HR leader directly if their issue is more sensitive. Situations like low performance or misconduct are still handled by humans.\n\nAlthough many businesses rolling out AI tools in 2024 emphasize the importance of having a human touchstone, LaMoreaux says it was initially hard to see how people fit into the tech equation. She emphasizes that user feedback and change management in employee behavior, like asking workers to automate some of their duties gradually rather than all at once, is crucial to successful AI implementation. She warns that simply throwing chatbots or copilots into a workforce and expecting them to adjust only builds resentment against the new tech and leadership team.\n\nFor companies just now adopting their own tools, it may seem daunting to establish a new way of workoptimized by AI. But LaMoreaux says HR leaders shouldn\u2019t be afraid to break the mold\u2014that\u2019s what drove the business and employee gains IBM couldn\u2019t have tapped into before. Thus far, AskHR has automated 765,000 tasks and trimmed down the HR operating budget by 40%.\n\n\u201cMost people say don't experiment in HR,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we are now moving our AskHR to generative AI. That allows us to trade faster, the natural language is a lot better, and it's giving us better outcomes.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While the term artificial intelligence (AI) has become something of a buzzword recently, the more accurate term for what most AI companies are aiming to achieve is machine learning. However, due to the cultural popularity of AI thanks to science fiction and Hollywood, the term has eclipsed machine learning as the primary descriptor for the current trend of data analytics and targeted information searches that constitute much of the AI sector. As such, many of the major AI stocks might be better classified as machine learning stocks.\n\nYet, the real value these machine learning stocks hold is in their potential future applications for data analytics, as machine learning models are intended to automate various algorithmic processes. Depending on the potential profit generation from this automation, a machine learning company could see revenues increase as a result of its software service. Investors would be wise to pay attention to these three machine learning stocks.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA long-time industry staple, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is one of the earliest developers of machine learning technology still on the market. Furthermore, one of its newest iterations of the Watson AI models, Watson Studio has the potential to make the company a critical member of the future of AI training and machine learning.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this new platform, IBM aims to empower smaller-scale developers to design and implement their own AIs through machine learning training. This enables data scientists and software engineers to tailor the Watson AI base to their specific needs while providing data and insights to IBM\u2019s development team.\n\nEssentially, this means that IBM enters into a symbiotic relationship with developers where the two work together to improve the efficiency of their respective machine-learning structures. With the introduction of Watson Studio and a robust profit margin so far in 2024, IBM stock continues to look like a great value among machine learning stocks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a dominant force in the software and cloud computing markets through its Microsoft Azure business section. Now the company is also pioneering the concept of machine learning models as a service to derive even more revenue from its powerful data center business.\n\nThe intended value of the Azure Machine Learning platform stems from Microsoft\u2019s ability to create scalable data analysis and AI training environments for customers of any size and application. Additionally, with the world\u2019s largest software user base, Microsoft\u2019s vast data resources offer a significant edge in AI development, enabling its machine learning services to become that much more effective.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis positions Microsoft to carve out a niche among machine learning stocks by improving the enterprise-level functionality of its customers while using that data to improve its own products. Pair this with Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the tech sector and deep pockets for further research and it\u2019s likely MSFT will continue to be a big player in the world of AI and machine learning development.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo discussion of machine learning stocks is complete without considering what Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has to offer. Alphabet has been a consistently quiet member of the machine learning community through its development and maintenance of a software called TensorFlow.\n\nOver eight years since its release and with dual functionality for programming in both Python and C++, TensorFlow is now one of the central tools through which many developers build machine learning applications. Though Alphabet does not earn revenue from its use as it is open source and free, the company owns the architecture on which many machine learning applications are built on.\n\nThis improves Alphabet\u2019s ability to later acquire these developers or cooperate with them on future development cycles. Taking this into consideration alongside a projected $340.61 billion in revenue for 2024, Alphabet stands out as a strong contender among machine learning stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget A.I.

        "content": "ServiceNow NOW shares have declined 5.4% in the past week. Year to date, NOW shares have returned 5.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s gain of 29.4% and the S&P 500\u2019s 17.7%. \r\n\r\nServiceNow\u2019s prospects have been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation that has led to lengthening in deal closure timings. The recent dip can be attributed to growing skepticism over NOW\u2019s growth prospects in the second half of 2024, which is unwarranted in our view. The dip now presents an entry opportunity for growth-oriented investors.\r\n\r\nServiceNow has been benefiting from strong expansion in clientele as enterprises undergoing digital transformation continue to adopt its workflow solutions. NOW ended the first quarter of 2024 with 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV).\r\n\r\nServiceNow had eight deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV and four deals of more than $10 million. It closed 59 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. Number of customers contributing more than $20 million or more grew 50% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe momentum is expected to have continued in second-quarter 2024, results for which NOW is scheduled to announce on Jul 24.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nServiceNow expects second-quarter 2024 subscription revenues between $2.525 billion and $2.53 billion, suggesting an improvement in the range of 21.5-22% year over year on a GAAP basis. At constant currency, subscription revenues are expected to grow in the 22% range.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 subscription revenues is pegged at $2.527 billion, roughly in line with the mid-point of the management\u2019s guidance range.\n\nNOW Stock to Ride Higher on Strong Portfolio\n\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. The enhanced capabilities are helping it to rapidly expand its footprint in the insurTech, strategic portfolio management, cloud management, talent development and public sector domains.\r\n\r\nNOW\u2019s expanding Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities are noteworthy, as its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, GenAI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in ServiceNow\u2019s history. Gen AI products were in seven of ServiceNow\u2019s top 10 deals, and it closed seven deals worth more than $1 million in ACV in the reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThrough its Washington, D.C. platform update, ServiceNow introduced a host of cutting-edge features aimed at streamlining operations, enhancing productivity and advancing the adoption of GenAI across various sectors.\r\n\r\nIn May, it unveiled new AI capabilities to foster talent development. Solutions like Now Assist for HR Service Delivery use GenAI to answer and act on questions related to talent development. Its Digital End-User Experience solution helps improve employee productivity and satisfaction while reducing costs. \r\n\r\nMoreover, a strong partner base that includes the likes of Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, International Business Machines IBM, Infosys and Equinix is strengthening NOW\u2019s AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues ServiceNow\n\nImage Source: ServiceNow\n\nServiceNow and Microsoft are integrating the new ServiceNow Now Assist and Microsoft Copilot into one seamless enterprise experience.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLeveraging NVIDIA\u2019s Avatar Cloud Engine speech, large language model and animation technologies that bring digital characters to life using GenAI, ServiceNow has unveiled AI avatars. \r\n\r\nNOW and IBM are combining the Now Platform with IBM watsonx to boost productivity for mutual customers and partners.\n\nConclusion\n\nServiceNow\u2019s robust GenAI portfolio and strong partner base are expected to drive its subscription revenues in the long haul.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor 2024, ServiceNow expects subscription revenues to be $10.56-$10.575 billion (up $20 million from the previous guidance), which suggests a rise between 21.5% and 22% from 2023 on a GAAP basis. At constant currency, subscription revenues are expected to grow 21.5% over 2023.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.88 billion, indicating 21.31% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $13.51 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and indicating a 25.32% year-over-year increase.\n\nEstimate Revision Steady Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA strong liquidity position with a cash balance of $8.8 billion and robust free cash flow generating ability ($3.3 billion estimated in 2024 compared with $2.7 billion reported in 2023) is noteworthy as it allows NOW to pursue various growth opportunities, including acquisitions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Value Style Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment, the Growth Style Score of A is hard to ignore.\r\n\r\nServiceNow currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Can International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?",
        "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:\n\n35% = US$8.2b \u00f7 US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.35 in profit.\n\nDoes International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, International Business Machines has a better ROE than the average (14%) in the IT industry. roe\n\nThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nCombining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 35% Return On Equity\n\nInternational Business Machines clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.52. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nBut note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "content": "HIROSHIMA, Japan, July 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, at the AI Ethics for Peace: World Religions commit to the Rome Call event,\u00a0IBM (NYSE: IBM) reaffirmed its leadership and commitment to the Rome Call for AI Ethics. Hosted by the Vatican's RenAIssance\u00a0Foundation, in collaboration with the Pontifical Academy of Life, Religions for Peace Japan, United Arab Emirates' Abu Dhabi Forum for Peace and the Chief Rabbinate of Israel's Commission for Interfaith Relations, this latest gathering for the Rome Call welcomes the co-signage of eastern religious leaders and seeks to shape the technical progress to support the progress of humanity, and inspire peaceful collaboration and global unity for ethical AI development, the core principle of the document. IBM Recommits to the 'Rome Call for AI Ethics' as the Vatican Welcomes Eastern Religions to the Pledge (Credit: IBM)\n\nThis interreligious event follows a series of Rome Call milestones that IBM has played a significant role in \u2013 from being one of the first signatories of the Call back in February 2020, to leading the Rome Call for AI Ethics Global University Summit, hosted by Notre Dame University and including 40 educational institutions in 2022, to the 2023 signing of the Call by three Abrahamic religions \u2013 Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\n\n\"AI is a technology with implications across every country, industry and value system \u2013 and its benefits should impact the whole of humanity. It is with great pride that IBM once again renews its commitment to the Rome Call for AI Ethics, accompanied now by new, like-minded eastern religious leaders,\" said Dar\u00edo Gil, IBM Senior Vice President and Director of Research. \"Delivering on our commitments is of paramount importance, and through efforts such as the Rome Call and the AI Alliance, we're uniting developers, researchers, industry leaders and advocates to transparently advance responsible AI rooted in open innovation.\"\n\nAs a longtime industry proponent in ethical AI development, IBM has worked with organizations around the world to ensure that powerful technologies \u2013 like AI \u2013 are created responsibly and ethically from the start.\u00a0In 2018, IBM introduced its Principles for Trust and Transparency and was among one of the first companies to create an AI Ethics Board as an instrument for internal governance around AI ethics, which includes processes, tools, guidelines, education and risk assessment for overseeing the company's AI development and usage practices, as well as partnership with many AI stakeholders to advance AI ethics in a concrete, collaborative and inclusive environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM's AI approach to ethics is infused throughout the company, including in its products and platforms such as watsonx and across IBM's AI and data governance assets and risk management solutions, reflecting the maturity of the company's journey and the clear vision for IBM and its clients. This approach is also used to develop Granite, IBM's family of large language models. These solutions and models reflect the maturity of IBM's journey and vision for its clients.\n\nAdditionally, in December 2023, IBM co-founded the AI Alliance, which now consists of more than 100 enterprises, startups, educational institutions, government agencies and research labs around the world. The Alliance is focused on accelerating open-source innovation to improve trust in AI, and responsibly maximize its benefits to people and society in an inclusive way.\n\nThe Alliance aims to build a differentiated approach to developing new, cultural and societal AI tuning techniques and to create a more accessible, democratized approach to AI development, with the skills and education to move the industry forward and will look to establish more than just guidelines on use, but rather concrete paths to build AI systems that advance and improve our daily lives. The goal is to transform AI users into AI co-creators, so that each person can maintain full agency and control of AI usage. This is in line with the principles of the Rome Call for AI Ethics, that focus on inclusion, rights and responsibility.\n\nTo learn more about IBM's efforts in AI ethics, visit\u00a0here.\n\nAbout IBM IBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

        "title": "Is International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) a Good Blue Chip Dividend Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other blue chip dividend stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in stocks, investors often keep a close eye on the company's financial health. Why? Because it directly impacts the potential returns on their investments. This is especially crucial for income investors, as solid financial health ensures regular dividend payments and steady dividend growth. In short, a company's strong financial footing means it's more likely to keep the cash flowing and the dividends climbing. Blue chip companies, especially those with over $100 billion in market cap, take the lead in this area. These firms are well-established, financially stable, and top players in their industries.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is commonly regarded as an index of blue chip stocks. This widely watched stock market index includes 30 of the largest and most established publicly traded companies in the US. The index surged by over 4.7% since the start of 2024 and in the past 12 months, it gained 16.4%.\n\nWhen comparing the performance of the broader market and the Dow Jones, both of which track large-cap U.S. companies, historical data reveals a high correlation between the two indices over time. However, there have been notable instances where their performances diverged significantly. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the market substantially outperformed the Dow Jones over one- and three-year periods. Conversely, over the 30-year period leading up to 2019, the Dow Jones slightly outperformed the broader market. This indicates that although these indices often move together, short-term performance can vary, and specific market conditions and economic factors can influence which index performs better during different periods. The Dow Jones underperformed the broader market in 2023 by a wide margin.\n\nWhile analysts frequently compare the performance of these two indices, it is important to note that the Dow represents only a small segment of the economy. In contrast, the broader market includes nearly 17 times as many companies. According to estimates from S&P Dow Jones Indices, more than $11.2 trillion investments were benchmarked to the broader market at the end of 2019. This is a staggering 350 times greater than the $32 billion benchmarked to the Dow. A key reason for the broader market's outperformance compared to the Dow last year is that the market places more emphasis on the tech giants, which were the primary drivers of the wider market\u2019s gains throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nReturning to the importance of blue chip companies, investors favor these firms because their strong financial health allows them to grow their dividends consistently. Dividend growth has remained a strong preference of investors over the years, prompting companies to increase their dividend payouts steadily. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best blue-chip dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we began by examining the current members of the Dow 30 that boasted a minimum market capitalization of $100 billion as of July 7. From this initial group, we specifically focused on companies that consistently pay dividends to their shareholders and have yields of at least 2%, as of July 7. These stocks were then ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them at the end of Q1 2024, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American technology company that specializes in a wide range of related services, including consulting, technology, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. The company is currently the sole provider offering both a comprehensive technology stack through their Watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI. The stock has been declining over the past decade but has recently gained momentum because of its potential in the field of AI. Since the start of 2024, the stock has gained nearly 9% and its 12-month returns came in at over 33%.\n\nOver the years, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has transformed itself into a blend of hardware, software, and consulting solutions, though it has faced challenges in maintaining consistent growth. The company is optimistic that AI will drive future revenue growth. In the first quarter of 2024, its Watsonx and generative AI business has shown strong, consistent momentum, growing each quarter, and has surpassed $1 billion in revenues since the launch of Watsonx in mid-2023. For the full year, the company continues to anticipate revenue performance consistent with its mid-single-digit growth model and approximately $12 billion in free cash flow.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital highlighted International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s AI business in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cAmong our bottom Q1 contributors short positions in Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and Palomar Holdings. Though we believe the quality and durability of IBM\u2019s free cash flow-generating capabilities remain questionable, investor sentiment has improved amid optimism for the company\u2019s still-nascent AI product suite.\u201d\n\nOn April 30, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) declared a 0.6% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.67 per share. This was the company's 29th consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes IBM one of the best blue chip dividend stocks on our list. As of July 7, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.80%.\n\nAt the end of Q1 2024, 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), compared with 50 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $1 billion. With over 1.2 million shares, AQR Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.\n\nOverall IBM ranks 10th on our list of the best blue chip dividend stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buyto see the other blue chip dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) closed the latest trading day at $177.64, indicating a +0.92% change from the previous session's end. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.1%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.08%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.28%.\n\nShares of the technology and consulting company have appreciated by 3.54% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.41% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.08%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of IBM in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 24, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.17, marking a 0.46% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.58 billion, up 0.67% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.90 per share and revenue of $63.04 billion, which would represent changes of +2.91% and +1.91%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for IBM. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. At present, IBM boasts a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nWith respect to valuation, IBM is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.78. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 12.96.\n\nIt's also important to note that IBM currently trades at a PEG ratio of 4.34. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Computer - Integrated Systems was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.46 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 170, positioning it in the bottom 33% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.90 points to a change of +2.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.32 indicates a change of +4.2% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $63.04 billion and $66.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +4.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This stream of passive income can make it easier to cover living expenses in retirement, and dividend aristocrats to buy tend to be less risky than growth stocks.\n\nHowever, even dividend stocks have their faults. Some companies that have issued dividends for many years suddenly have to cut or suspend them. Furthermore, some dividend stocks significantly underperform the stock market and result in lost capital.\n\nHowever, not every investor wants to outperform the stock market. Some people will exchange beating the market for steady cash flow with very little downside. That\u2019s where some of the top dividend aristocrats to buy come into play. Dividend aristocrats are stocks that have increased their dividends in each of the past 25 years. The corporations on this list have a good history of dividend hikes and offer solid yields for present investors. These are some of the top dividend aristocrats to consider as retirement draws closer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) offers a 3.80% yield and trades at a 20 P/E ratio. Although the company has lagged the stock market and even produced a lost decade for investors, the stock is rebounding. New investments into cloud computing have positioned IBM to capitalize on artificial intelligence tailwinds. The stock has a spark based on its 9% year-to-date gain and 33% gain over the past year.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t need IBM to do as well on stock price returns to stay ahead of the market. The yield is quite high, and IBM continues to hike its dividend each year. The company raised its quarterly dividend from $1.66 per share to $1.67 per share this year.\n\nThe low dividend growth rate is based on IBM\u2019s low growth rates. The company only reported 1% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, although the growth rate goes up to 3% at constant currency. However, the company grew its net income by 73% year-over-year and ended up with a double-digit net profit margin.\n\nSysco (SYY) Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMost high-yielding stocks trade long-term gains for high yields and stability. Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is no exception to the rule. The food distribution company trades at a 17 P/E ratio and has a 2.92% yield. Shares are roughly flat over the past five years. Shares only dropped by about 3% in 2022. That year featured many meltdowns from tech stocks and pandemic favorites, but Sysco held steady.\n\nSysco tends to report low-single-digit revenue growth, and the company did not disappoint. Revenue increased by 3% year-over-year in the first quarter while EBITDA was hip by 10.5% year-over-year. Leadership cited \u201cvolume growth, excellent margin management, and disciplined productivity improvement\u201d for the company\u2019s successful quarter. Sysco also generated a record first quarter operating profit of $803.6 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the stock hasn\u2019t budged for most of the last five years, Wall Street analysts believe that\u2019s due to change. Sysco is rated as a Strong Buy with a projected 23% upside. The highest price target of $91 per share indicates that Sysco can gain 30% from current levels.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeople will always need gasoline for their vehicles. While many companies fulfill this demand, few corporations do it as well as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). The company has amassed a market cap north of $500 billion and has a 14 P/E ratio. Investors also get a 3.35% yield at current levels. The company even has a decent dividend growth rate considering its high yield. Exxon Mobil hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.91 per share to $0.95 per share last year. That\u2019s a 4.4% year-over-year increase.\n\nExxon Mobil has also delivered solid returns for long-term investors. Shares are up by 11% year-to-date and have gained 49% over the past five years. Revenue and net income were both down in the first quarter. However, the company still generated $8.2 billion in Q1 earnings and achieved quarterly gross production of more than 600,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in Guyana.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target from 15 analysts suggests that the stock can gain an additional 20%.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "IBM Enhances AI Scalability With Twin Buyouts: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM recently completed the twin acquisitions of StreamSets and webMethods to augment its AI platform and automation capabilities. The buyouts will offer comprehensive application and data integration platforms in the industry and help business enterprises undergo rapid digital transformation by embracing generative AI.\r\n\r\nComplementing IBM DataStage and Databand platform with a hybrid and multi-cloud approach, the buyouts will offer an integrated product for clients to facilitate seamless applications and services. This, in turn, will enable clients to effectively manage data quality within a distributed data landscape with real-time data streaming for a faster response and informed decision-making process.\n\nWhat Do the Acquisitions Bring to the Table?\n\nStreamSets is a real-time data integration firm specializing in streaming structured, unstructured and semi-structured data across hybrid multi-cloud environments. It extends the breadth and depth of IBM Data Fabric\u2019s data integration capabilities through continuous, real-time processing, integration and transfer of data when it is available, reducing latency and data staleness. This helps users ingest, enrich and harness the potential of streaming data through features such as offset handling and delivery guarantees.\r\n\r\nwebMethods is an Integration & API Management platform that runs in the cloud, on-premise, in hybrid or multi-cloud environments. Leveraging the webMethods Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), it helps organizations manage the tangled web of systems, applications and data silos within business environments by enabling users to deploy and execute integrations anywhere. It will enable IBM to meet local data sovereignty requirements while driving enterprise-wide innovation by offering customers a path to multi-cloud hybrid integration.\n\nScaling AI Solutions\n\nIn March this year, IBM took a giant step forward in enterprise AI innovation by integrating the open-source Mixtral-8x7B large language model into its watsonx AI and data platform. Built on innovative Sparse modeling and the Mixture-of-Experts technique, this model excels in rapid data processing and contextual analysis. Its ability to efficiently handle vast datasets makes it a valuable asset for businesses seeking actionable insights.\r\n\r\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI \u2014 the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store, built on an open lake house architecture; and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry Collaborations to Tap Generative AI\n\nIBM works closely with a diverse AI partner ecosystem through an open and collaborative approach to plan, build, implement and operate generative AI solutions. This open ecosystem approach is likely to help clients define the right models and architecture to deliver their desired outcomes.\r\n\r\nIBM collaborated with SAP SE SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry. The collaboration is likely to facilitate higher productivity and help accelerate business transformation in consumer-packaged goods and retail firms. The company also collaborated with Salesforce, Inc. CRM to drive increased productivity and help accelerate business transformation with generative AI.\n\nDown But Not Out\n\nDespite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM is facing stiff competition from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSFT Azure. The company\u2019s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is a challenging task. Weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns.\n\nIBM Outperforms Subindustry\n\nOver the past year, IBM has gained 33% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 24.1%. However, it lagged Microsoft, which rose 35.1% over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM Estimate Movement Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings estimates for IBM for 2024 have moved down from $10.07 to $9.90 over the past 90 days, while the same for 2025 has declined from $10.58 to $10.32.\n\nIBM Trading Above 50-Day Moving Average Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIntel is currently trading above the 50-day moving average.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nIBM aims to benefit from the increasing propensity of business enterprises to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to secure multi-cloud management with a diligent focus on hybrid cloud and AI solutions. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.\r\n\r\nHowever, with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), it appears that the recent initiatives have mostly fallen flat as it plays a catch-up game with its rivals. With declining earnings estimates, the stock is witnessing a negative investor perception. Consequently, it might not be a prudent investment decision to bet on the stock at the moment.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3 Best Blockchain Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Blockchain technology remains one of those profound innovations that can be tough to comprehend. Indeed, blockchain tech, while profound, can be tough to understand, at least until one has had a chance to see it put to work on various applications. In some ways, it\u2019s like the metaverse, whereby one has to try before they can fully appreciate the technology under the hood.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a major innovation made possible by blockchain technology. However, it\u2019s not the only one. And though various cryptocurrencies are novel investments or speculations, I\u2019d argue that the most far-reaching blockchain innovations may be many years away.\n\nUnless you own Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), you are probably unaware of blockchain technology\u2019s full capabilities. The key takeaway is that blockchain technology allows for decentralization and next-level security.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor now, blockchain is synonymous with cryptocurrencies. But in the future, it may grow to become a larger, more impactful theme. Here are three of my favorite blockchain stocks to play it.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) may be one of the top crypto plays in public markets for many investors seeking a convenient proxy to play some sort of Bitcoin bounce. It\u2019s far more than just an exchange platform, though. Coinbase stands out as an innovator that\u2019s keeping the blockchain tech rolling along.\n\nARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, one of the company\u2019s biggest believers and shareholders through her ARK ETFs, sees Coinbase as a top contender in digital wallets, a market in which she sees a \u201cwinner take most\u201d type of scenario playing out.\n\nIndeed, there are a slew of digital wallets out there. However, what separates Coinbase from the pack is its blockchain expertise. If blockchain technology holds the keys to the ultimate digital wallet with the best security and seamless peer-to-peer transactions, Coinbase stands out as a horse worth betting on.\n\nAfter surging 188% in the past year, COIN stock is red hot and starting to get expensive at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) of 44.11. Given the blockchain tech you expose yourself to, perhaps it\u2019s worth braving the momentum and elevated sticker price for this blockchain stock, especially if you believe in crypto and the tech that powers it.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a relatively mature company, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) actually has its hand in many high-tech pies. From artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing to blockchain, IBM is innovating in some of the most exciting areas of the emerging tech universe. Still, the stock does not trade like it\u2019s on the cutting edge of tech, with IBM stock going for a trailing P/E of 17.7.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps IBM\u2019s reputation as a laggard in the past decade is a contributing factor behind the stock\u2019s seemingly discounted multiple. Aside from AI, IBM is exploring the potential behind blockchain technologies with various projects that could help put the technology to use in industry.\n\nWith interesting projects seeking to unchain the power of blockchain in specific industries (think Project XCEED for the auto industry), perhaps IBM is the blockchain stock to watch.\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of digital wallets and blockchain tech, we have Block (NYSE:SQ), formerly known as Square, which is behind digital wallet Cash App, Square (payments), Tidal (a music streaming service) and Bitcoin projects of its own.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really happening with TBD, Block\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d of sorts. However, I do know that the company has shown that it is serious about the potential of blockchain technology. First, the firm changed its name from Square to Block back in 2021, and second, the company has \u201ca stake in the future\u201d with its stake in Bitcoin.\n\nAt a forward P/E of 19.4, SQ stock looks absurdly undervalued. Until Block breaks ground on something truly unique, it will be tough for the firm to regain the attention of investors now that it\u2019s down close to 77% from its bubbly peak of 2021.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Canada will invest C$120 million ($88.2 million) over five years to build a national chip network, as calls intensify for the government to do more to bolster its lagging semiconductor sector.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden\u2019s Fourth of July Shrouded by Pressure to Drop 2024 Bid Kamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels House Democrats Consider Demanding Biden Withdraw From Race Newsom Shocks California Politics by Scrapping Crime Measure China Can End Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says\n\nIndustry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne announced the outlay from the federal Strategic Innovation Fund on Thursday. The investment supports a C$220 million project led by the nonprofit research accelerator CMC Microsystems to help Canadian startups commercialize new technologies.\n\nCalled the Fabrication of Integrated Components for the Internet\u2019s Edge (Fabric) network, the program will subsidize the production of prototypes and give participants cheaper access to tools, software and training, The Logic first reported. Fabric also offers funding of up to C$10 million for hardware development in semiconductors, superconductors, smart sensors and photonics.\n\n\u201cSupport for Fabric secures Canada\u2019s future in semiconductors and advanced manufacturing,\u201d CMC President Gordon Harling said in a statement.\n\nThe new funding follows the April announcement of a joint C$187 million investment by IBM and the governments of Canada and Quebec to expand IBM Canada\u2019s chip packaging facility in Bromont, about 50 miles east of Montreal.\n\nWhile some are heralding a renaissance in Canada\u2019s chip sector, others say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has not done enough to keep up with global competition, particularly in the wake of the US Chips Act in 2022. The law set aside $39 billion in direct grants, plus loans and loan guarantees worth $75 billion, to incentivize American semiconductor production.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government has, in contrast, promised billions in subsidies to match incentives in the US Inflation Reduction Act to lure global auto manufacturers to build electric-vehicle batteries in Canada.\n\nPaul Slaby, director of Canada\u2019s Semiconductor Council, recently complained that Canada lacks an industrial strategy for the chip sector. Speaking at the International Economic Forum of the Americas conference in Montreal in June, Slaby said the Trudeau government only lately started building a dedicated team for the industry. He suggested Canada seek to establish itself in international trade by controlling one niche piece of the supply chain, as the Netherlands has done with its photolithography machine producer ASML Holding NV.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the announcement of the Chips Act, more than 50 semiconductor projects have been undertaken in the US. Competition between the US and China offers an opportunity to align with American interests, Slaby proposed. \u201cWe need a semiconductor pact with the US,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

However, certain crypto infrastructure plays remain poised for growth regardless of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. These infrastructure providers offer essential services and technologies that support the broader crypto ecosystem. This has led to my list of the best crypto infrastructure stocks for investors.\n\nKey players in this space include companies involved in blockchain technology, crypto exchanges, and digital payment solutions. I also believe that crypto miners will be able to make a strong pivot or diversification into the data center industry. However, this will only be possible if they decide to make a new strategic direction.

This includes a five-year revenue growth forecast of 17.08% and an EPS growth forecast of 83.03%. These projections suggest that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for advanced processors and graphics cards in various industries.\n\nAMD has been consistently introducing innovative products. These include its Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards. Both products have gained significant market share and have been well-received by consumers and businesses alike. The company\u2019s focus on innovation and performance has helped it compete effectively against larger rivals.\n\nDespite its strong growth prospects and financial performance, AMD\u2019s stock trades at a relatively attractive valuation compared to its peers. The company\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 40x and PEG ratio of 0.66 suggest that the stock may be undervalued considering its expected growth. This positions it well to be one of those crypto infrastructure stocks for investors to consider.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) In this photo illustration, the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) is a prominent Bitcoin mining company with significant infrastructure investments. Its large-scale mining operations benefit from efficient and scalable systems, positioning it well regardless of Bitcoin\u2019s market fluctuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nMARA MARA holds 18,536 BTC, which, along with cash, is valued at $1.4 billion. These substantial Bitcoin holdings provide the company with a strong balance sheet and the potential to benefit from future appreciation in the price of Bitcoin. MARA\u2019s proprietary mining pool saw a 10% year-over-year increase in blocks captured.\n\nMARA is actively expanding its operations and exploring new technologies. The company has made notable expansions in immersion cooling technology, which can improve mining efficiency and reduce costs. Additionally, MARA is pursuing international projects, such as a 2-megawatt pilot in Finland for sustainable heating.\n\nMARA trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 9x and a forward P/E ratio of 6.17x, which are relatively low compared to the company\u2019s growth potential. The company\u2019s high return on equity (ROE) of 42.30% and return on invested capital (ROIC) of 19.86% indicate its ability to generate strong returns for shareholders.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive.

The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a major player in blockchain technology, offering enterprise solutions through its IBM Blockchain platform.\n\nIBM\u2019s recent acquisition of HashiCorp for $6.4 billion is a significant move towards becoming a software and services-focused company. HashiCorp\u2019s expertise in cloud infrastructure management aligns well with IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud strategy. Also, IBM has been making substantial investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and has already surpassed $1 billion in bookings for AI-focused products and consulting since mid-2023. As AI and blockchain become increasingly intertwined, I see strong potential for IBM to continue its growth in these two respective industries.\n\nThe biggest draw card for me with the company is this: IBM\u2019s low beta of 0.72 suggests that its stock price is less volatile than the overall market. This defensive nature, coupled with the company\u2019s consistent dividend growth over the past 28 years, makes IBM an attractive option for risk-averse investors seeking stable returns, particularly during times of market uncertainty.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): A Good Dividend Aristocrat to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other dividend aristocrats.\n\nInvestors have always put income at the top of their list. And when it comes to raking in money, you can\u2019t beat dividend stocks. Research by S&P Dow Jones Indices has demonstrated that over the long haul, dividend-paying companies have outperformed non-dividend companies and the broader market on a risk-adjusted basis. Though investing in high dividend yields is not advised by analysts, recent research indicates that dividend yield is a risk factor that pays off, historically earnings higher returns than a market-cap-weighted benchmark. When paired with other factors like volatility, quality, momentum, size, and value, dividend yield strategies can potentially tap into systematic sources of returns.\n\nDividend yield and dividend growth have always been a hot topic among investors. But little did they realize that dividend yield is a key piece of the puzzle when it comes to dividend growth. When it comes to the Dividend Aristocrats Index, the knack for increasing dividends for 25 straight years doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing yield. The index has consistently outshone its benchmark by delivering higher yields, typically between 2% and 2.9% over the past 26 years ending 2023. On average, the index\u2019s yield was 2.5%, compared to the market\u2019s 1.8%. To read more about high dividend stocks, have a look at Best Dividend Stocks Yielding at Least 7% According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn addition to offering solid yields, dividend aristocrats are also less volatile than other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outpaced the broader market over the long haul with less volatility, which is indicated by its higher risk-adjusted returns. The index\u2019s ability to provide downside protection is evident in its upside and downside capture ratio. These stocks have outperformed the market in 69.34% of down months and 43.61% of up months. Moreover, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has experienced lower drawdowns compared to the benchmark index. The report further mentioned that the index delivered an average excess return of 1.05% during down months compared to the broad-based benchmark.\n\nData from 2023 highlights how eager companies are to boost their dividends. This isn't just a knee-jerk move to lure investors; it's backed by robust corporate balance sheets, with companies raking in more cash flows than ever before. According to Janus Henderson, corporate cash flow remained strong in 2023 across most sectors, giving companies ample resources for dividends and share buybacks. As a result, global dividend growth saw a 5% increase for the year, aligning with the long-term trend. The firm also gave a positive outlook for dividends in 2024. It said that dividends appear solidly supported this year, although one-time special dividends are expected to decrease from the record levels observed over the past three years. The firm\u2019s forecast predicts $1.72 trillion in dividends for 2024, marking a 3.9% increase on a headline basis, which translates to a 5% growth rate on a headline basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are many dividend aristocrats that offer solid yields to shareholders. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with high yields.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we looked at a group of 67 dividend aristocrat companies, which are known for raising dividends for 25 years or more. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of June 25 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 funds as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nDividend Yield as of June 25: 3.86%\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.86% as of June 25, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) ranks ninth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The New York-based tech company announced a 0.6% hike in its quarterly dividend on April 30 to $1.67 per share. Through this increase, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 29 years.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reported mixed earnings in the first quarter of 2024. The company's revenue of $14.4 billion missed analysts' consensus by $80 million and its adjusted earnings per share of $1.68 was $0.09 below expectations. Overall, the company had a solid first quarter, with its main segments experiencing growth. Total revenue increased by 3% YoY in constant currency, free cash flow surged to $1.9 billion, and profit margins expanded. Software revenue climbed 6%, boosted by Red Hat and artificial intelligence (AI), while the infrastructure segment grew even though it is two years into the current mainframe product cycle.\n\nOne of the primary challenges currently facing International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is its Consulting business, which is a major competitive advantage for the company. The company is experiencing increased pressure regarding discretionary projects as clients become more hesitant to invest in smaller, non-essential projects due to economic uncertainty. The good news is that consulting for AI-related projects is thriving. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has secured over $1 billion in business related to generative AI, including its Watsonx platform. This total comprises both consulting and software, but it is predominantly weighted toward consulting. Since the start of 2024, the stock has delivered over 7.5% returns to shareholders.\n\nAs of the close of Q1 2024, 49 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), down slightly from 50 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $1 billion.\n\nOverall IBM ranks 9th on our list of the best dividend aristocrats ranked by yield. You can visit Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 10to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Given the current market conditions, you\u2019d want to consider offloading some Dow Stocks to sell before dragging your portfolio down further.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indices have soared by double-digit margins in the past 12 months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lags with a modest 3.8% increase. The Dow\u2019s performance has been weighed down by underperforming giants among its 30 components, which sparked fresh demands for a makeover of the prolific index.\n\nOn the flip side, we\u2019ve witnessed a monumental tech-driven rally that has effectively bypassed traditional, blue-chip companies that dominate the Dow. The market\u2019s focus is skewed towards AI-powered tech stocks that notched up record gains last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHence, it would be prudent for those looking to curb their downside risk to rotate out of these three Dow stocks. These stocks are up against multiple headwinds and have performed sluggishly of late, pointing to limited upside potential ahead.\n\nNike (NKE) NKE stock: A photograph of the storefront of a Nike store.\n\nSource: Square Box Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a powerhouse in athletic apparel and footwear but is now under major duress. The firm has dominated global markets for decades but faces major challenges now. Over the past year, its management has raised concerns over weakening consumer demand in North America, a slow recovery in the Chinese market, and growing competition weighing down the business.\n\nMoreover, its most recent quarterly earnings print cash a shadow over the entire sector. Recently, fourth-quarter (Q4) sales and first-quarter (Q1) projections for fiscal year (FY) 2025 fell below expectations. During Nike\u2019s Q4 earnings call, CEO John Donahoe predicted revenue declines in the mid-single-digit range in FY25.\n\nIn efforts to control the bleeding, the company has initiated belt-tightening measures, including reducing its workforce by about 2%. This move is part of the broader effort to streamline operations and curb production costs as the company braces for top-and-bottom-line declines this year.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0has seen its stock jump north of 30% in the past year, fueled largely by AI initiatives. However, despite multiple announcements of AI advancements and strategic partnerships, these initiatives have yet to result in significant revenue growth. The firm continues facing challenges in transforming its AI hype into tangible financial success, with its sales growth languishing behind its historical averages.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, its reliance on mergers and acquisitions rather than organic growth continues to raise concerns. It\u2019s shelling out billions like its most recent $7 billion deal to acquire cloud company HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). Consequently, this approach continues diluting shareholder value while further draining IBM\u2019s cash reserves.\n\nCoupled with a declining dividend yield, these factors make IBM a relatively unattractive bet for yield-focused investors. It\u2019s currently yielding 3.85% on a trailing-twelve-month (TTM) basis, 20% behind its 5-year average. Hence, IBM\u2019s current positioning casts a shadow over its appeal amid an uncertain investing landscape.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's (MCD) building with logo at sunset\n\nSource: ATIKAN PORNCHAIPRASIT / Shutterstock.com\n\nFast-food giant, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) faces a shaky near-term future with tensions rising in the Middle East and commodity prices soaring.\n\nThe firm witnessed a marked slowdown in its Q1 performance, with global comparable sales creeping up by just 1.9%, missing the 2.3% analyst expectations. The discrepancy is starker when compared to the previous year\u2019s robust 12.6% growth.\n\nMoreover, the fast-food bellwether is facing major challenges due to ongoing food price inflation, which is impacting consumer spending and the affordability of MCD\u2019s menu items. This inflationary pressure has compelled MCD to raise prices, limiting its value appeal, which it is known for.\n\nFurthermore, the Middle East conflict has had a considerable impact on its business, with questions over the future. The concerns surrounding the region have effectively dimmed the bright spots seen in markets like Japan and Europe. Globally, the firm is grappling with only modest growth and tough competition, complicating its operational landscape. With these diverse geopolitical challenges, MCD is steering through a potentially rocky future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "3 Quantum Computing Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "For tech-centric investors, quantum computing stocks many offer the biggest bang for your buck. To make a long story short, the underlying innovation facilitates multiple processes to run simultaneously.\u00a0 Therefore, it can dramatically outperform some of the fastest and most rigorous classical computer available. It all centers on the qubit.\n\nSimilar to the bit in classical computers, a qubit represents the basic unit of information in quantum computers. What makes qubits distinct, though, is the concept of superposition. Essentially, this block of information can be represented as a 0 or 1 or any proportion of these two binary values in both states simultaneously.\n\nA very rudimentary explanation is that classical computers represent the equivalent of a single-lane roadway. On the other hand, quantum computers represent multi-lane expressways. Multiple cars can zip along the expressway at high speeds, enabling for far greater utility than a single-lane roadway.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAgain, that\u2019s a very basic analogy and oversimplifies the complex granularity involved. But this roughly addresses why the sector is so enticing. And with that, below are some of the top quantum computing stocks to consider.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nTo be blunt, legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) probably isn\u2019t going to make you rich, at least not in the 1,000% return over the course of a few years sense. Nevertheless, I\u2019d consider Big Blue to be one of the top quantum computing stocks for generational wealth. That\u2019s because if history is any guide, IBM isn\u2019t going anywhere. Incorporated in 1911, it\u2019s older than all of us and will likely outlive us.\n\nAnother aspect that makes IBM compelling is the underlying financial consistency. You\u2019re probably not going to see too many remarkable results. However, in the past four quarters, the tech giant posted an average earnings per share of roughly $2.44. This print translated to an earnings surprise of almost 4.9%.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), IBM posted net income of $8.15 billion or earnings of $8.82 per share. Revenue hit $62.07 billion. For the year, covering experts believe EPS may rise 3.3% to $9.94. On the top line, sales could see a 2% increase to $63.05 billion.\n\nThese aren\u2019t standout stats. However, keep in mind that IBM offers a forward yield of 3.86%.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) IBM Q System One Quantum Computer at the Consumer Electronic Show CES 2020. Quantum computing stocks.\n\nSource: Boykov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Berkeley, California, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) falls under the computer hardware space. Per its public profile, Rigetti builds quantum computers along with superconducting quantum processors. It\u2019s an intriguing idea among quantum computing stocks, especially because it could be relatively undervalued. RGTI trades at 11.55X trailing-year sales. In the first quarter, it traded at 16.82X.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs exciting as Rigetti is, however, it\u2019s undoubtedly a risky entity. During the past four quarters, its average loss per share came out to 13.3 cents. Further, the average \u201cearnings\u201d surprise landed at almost 4% below breakeven. That\u2019s not exactly the most encouraging profile.\n\nIn the TTM period, Rigetti incurred a net loss of $72.53 million or 52 cents per share. However, revenue in the period reached $12.86 million. What\u2019s more, the most recent quarterly sales growth rate (year-over-year) hit 38.7%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts see a mitigation in loss per share to 41 cents. More importantly, sales could rise 27.4% to land at $15.3 million. For those willing to throw caution to the wind, RGTI ranks among the quantum computing stocks to consider.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother hardware specialist, IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) engages in the development of general-purpose quantum computing systems. In particular, the company utilizes its trapped-ion technology for its advanced systems. This innovation provides a key advantage related to qubit coherence and scalability. Basically, IonQ is attempting to build the foundation for large-scale quantum systems.\n\nWhat makes IONQ stock especially enticing is that the underlying quantum computers are accessible through major cloud platforms. That should help overall visibility. However, investors shouldn\u2019t be under any misguidance: IONQ is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. During the past four quarters, the company incurred a loss per share of almost 21 cents. The average quarterly surprise landed at 16.85% below parity.\n\nIn the TTM period, IonQ incurred a net loss of $170 million. However, revenue in the period hit $25.34 million. Further, the most recent quarterly sales growth rate clocked in at almost 77%. For fiscal 2024, the loss per share could expand unfavorably to 87 cents. However, revenue may fly 79.1% to $39.47 million.

        "content": "Four REITs Get Analyst Upgrades This Week\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAs an investor, it's always exciting to see positive news on one of your stocks that could potentially increase the share price. The news might be a dividend raise, a good earnings report, a new product, service, or alliance, or an upgrade from a prestigious brokerage or bank analyst.\n\nFour real estate investment trusts (REITs) received analyst upgrades this week. Three of the four are projected to have substantial upside from present share price levels to meet the new price targets. Take a look:\n\nEquity Residential (NYSE:EQR) is a Chicago-based REIT that owns or invests in 299 apartment communities with 79,688 units located in 12 larger and more affluent cities, such as Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Denver. Its May 2024 occupancy rate was 96.5%. Equity Residential has been a member of the S&P 500 since 2001.\n\nOn April 23, Equity Residential reported its first quarter 2024 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.93 per share beat the consensus estimate of $0.91 and improved from the $0.87 per share FFO in the first quarter of 2023. Revenue of $730.818 million beat the estimate of $726.227 million and topped the Q1 2023 revenue of $705.088 million.\n\nOn June 28, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb upgraded Equity Residential from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $70 to $80. That represents a potential gain of 17.1% from its recent closing price.\n\nAnalyst Goldfarb is not the only analyst with a recent price target hike. On May 30, Mizuho analyst Vikram Malhotra maintained a Neutral rating on Equity Residential and raised the target from $61 to $64. However, Analyst Goldfarb\u2019s new target price is significantly higher.\n\nOne thing to note is that on June 26, Executive VP/CFO Robert Garechana reported an insider sale of 6,357 shares of Equity Residential stock for a total transaction value of $439,141. While insider sales are never as noteworthy as insider buys, Equity Residential has gained 32.7% since early November, so this could be just some normal profit-taking. Mr. Garechana still owns 14,576 shares, including over 7,200 shares in 401(k) plans and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) account.\n\nAcadia Realty Trust (NYSE:AKR) is a Rye, NY-based retail REIT with 190 properties across centralized urban areas in 22 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn recent news, Acadia Realty sold a 95% interest in Shops at Grand, a shopping center in Maspeth, NY to J.P. Morgan Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. for $48 million, excluding closing costs. Acadia will use the net proceeds to reduce leverage and purchase high-growth street retail properties.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 26, JP Morgan analyst Alexander Goldfarb upgraded Acadia Realty Trust from Underweight to Neutral and announced an $18 price target. However, Acadia is already reasonably close to this price target, with a recent close of $17.51.\n\nAcadia Realty has recently looked quite substantial and has gained 36.5% since late October.\n\nAmericold Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:COLD) is a specialized Atlanta, GA-based industrial REIT that owns and operates temperature-controlled storage warehouses and services food producers and retailers who need cold storage. Americold has 241 locations across the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina and has been in business for 120 years.\n\nOn May 9, Americold reported its first quarter 2024 operating results. FFO of $0.27 per share beat the consensus estimate of $0.25 and was 22.73% above FFO of $0.22 in Q1 2023. Revenue of $664.980 million missed the consensus estimate of $679.489 million and declined slightly from $676.489 million in Q1 2023.\n\nThe earnings caught the eye of a few analysts. On May 24, Barclays analyst Anthony Powell maintained Americold at equal weight and raised the price target from $25 to $26. A few days earlier, Scotiabank analyst Greg McGinniss upgraded Americold from Sector Perform to Sector Outperform and raised the price target from $27 to $30.\n\nInvestors keyed in on the FFO beat and ignored the weaker revenue, making Americold the second-best-performing REIT in May with a 21.39% total return. This was a nice rebound because, year-to-date, Americold still has a total return of -11.25%.\n\nOn June 26, Piper Sandler analyst Anthony Paolone upgraded Americold Realty Trust from Neutral to Overweight and maintained the price target at $30, which represents a potential gain of 20.72% from its recent closing price.\n\nHowever, despite beating the estimates on FFO and favorable analyst reviews, Americold\u2019s total return is -16.50% year-to-date.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is an Austin, TX-based Data Center REIT with over 218,000 cross-connects in 300 facilities across 25 countries. It has over 5000 customers, including stalwart tech companies such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ:ORCL), and IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM).\n\nOn May 2, Digital Realty Trust reported Q1 2024 operating results. FFO of $1.67 per share beat the consensus estimate of $1.63 per share and was above FFO of $1.66 in Q1 2023. Revenue of $1.33 billion missed the estimated $1.36 billion and was slightly below $1.34 billion in Q1 2023.\n\nOn June 26, BMO Capital analyst Ari Klein upgraded Digital Realty Trust from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $144 to $170 per share, representing a potential gain of 14.2% from its recent closing price.\n\nAnalyst Klein was not the only one expressing positive sentiments about Digital Realty. On June 3, RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin maintained an Outperform rating on Digital Realty and raised the price target from $144 to $160.\n\nDigital Realty Trust is up 33.9% since touching a low of $111.05 in late October.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "content": "Technology is constantly evolving, and each trend has its cycles. Cloud computing gained prominence and popularity at the beginning of the last decade, and this trend reemerged during the Covid-19 pandemic. The moment is approaching when cloud infrastructure stocks will show their multiple growth again.\n\nReviews by leading investors may mention that further development of artificial intelligence (AI) requires the latest chips. However, these recommendations often overlook the need for adapted high-powered servers that can be provided by cloud market leaders. Further, the infrastructure and relevant data should be kept in reliable and convenient storage. So, cloud solutions come into play, giving individuals, corporations, and government agencies the ability to thrive in the web environment without the hassle of running their servers. Each of the presented stocks has gained 50% or more over the past year and are not ready to rest on its laurels.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIn investors\u2019 minds, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is associated primarily with profits from the advertising business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoogle Search ranks first among the company\u2019s successes and accounts for 90% of the market. Search, display, network advertising and YouTube form the basis of the business and provide the company with super-profits. In the first quarter of 2024, Google Search revenue increased by 14.3% year-over-year (YOY), but Alphabet intends to diversify its interests. Google Cloud strengthens the results of the mega-company, as it has added another thousand products and features to the total number. Alphabet is in a state of constant competition with other cloud infrastructure stocks and is improving to withstand the influence of other tech giants.\n\nAlphabet, the third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, is showing positive profitability, encouraging analysts to make optimistic forecasts. The current P/E ratio is close to 28, indicating a low price compared to other tech players. The company\u2019s revenue is projected to grow by 11% CAGR through 2026. At the same time, earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow by 20% on an average annualized basis.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the general public was looking away at the hype of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been climbing step by step to the top of the tech world. The $2 trillion market capitalization is one of its latest achievements, cementing AMZN\u2019s position among the top cloud infrastructure stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a sharp loss of height in 2022, Amazon has shown that it can draw conclusions and catch up with competitors. It made timely staff changes and cut costs in several areas. In October 2023, the price was close to $120, while in the summer of 2024, it reached $197. Such results seem incredible compared to the starting value of 7 cents in 1997, but the stock is ready to surprise investors in the future.\n\nUnlike new names on the market, Amazon has repeatedly proven its adaptability and capacity to thrive in several areas. It is difficult to imagine the modern market of technological solutions without Amazon Web Services (AWS), which steadily holds its position against the competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. With annual revenues of more than $100 billion, Amazon can conduct researches and be among the first to implement global cloud solutions.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

IBM (NYSE:IBM) made a jump in the price per share from $138 to $197, proving the feasibility of diversifying its interests.\n\nThe company is generally pursuing a well-thought-out strategy, but several key initiatives have brought it to the top of the tech world\u2019s Olympus. The acquisition of Red Hat for $34 billion in 2019 triggered the growth of the company\u2019s hybrid cloud computing capabilities.\n\nIBM recognized the potential of artificial intelligence in time and launched the WatsonX platform. It has become the home of new AI-based solutions and has satisfied a large share of the demand for AI services. With a strong cloud portfolio and backing from tech-focused investors, IBM has set its sights on the field of quantum computing. In collaboration with Fundaci\u00f3n Ikerbasque, the company has entered the forefront of computer science, preparing the ground for unique offerings. Analysts\u2019 estimates elevate IBM among cloud infrastructure stocks. Despite the current price of about $175.10, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a buy rating and a $200 price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ARMONK, N.Y., July 1, 2024/PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM)\u00a0today announced it has completed its acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG after receiving all required regulatory approvals. The acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management and data ingestion.  IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\nThe acquisition builds on IBM's extensive software portfolio, with StreamSets adding new data ingestion capabilities to IBM's AI and data platform, and webMethods bringing Integration Platform as a Service (iPaas) capabilities to IBM's Automation solutions. IBM's clients and partners will now have access to one of the most modern and comprehensive application and data integration platforms in the industry to drive innovation and prepare business for AI.\n\nOrganizations are facing an explosion of apps, APIs, events and data spread across hybrid cloud environments worldwide. In fact, IDC estimates that 1 billion new applications are expected by 2028 due to the rapid emergence of generative AI1. As organizations continue their digital transformation journeys, application and data integration solutions are critical for application modernization and effectively deploying AI across the enterprise.\n\nStreamSets and webMethods currently serve more than 1,500 companies across the globe and will provide additional integration technologies for next-generation AI applications that require data and connectivity to everything, everywhere. And, the industry is continuing to grow, with IDC predicting the worldwide integration software market to exceed $18.0 billion in 20272.\n\n\"This is an important acquisition for IBM as we help our clients turn complexities into competitive advantage,\" said Dinesh Nirmal, Senior Vice President, Products, IBM Software. \"StreamSets and webMethods bring new capabilities to our clients to embrace data and AI to better manage the growth and complexity of applications.

When that data moves between sources and targets, streaming tools like StreamSets provide updated data in real-time to target destinations. This hybrid and multi-cloud ready product, which IBM plans to embed as a premium feature in watsonx.data, makes it easier for users to ingest, enrich, and harness the potential of streaming data enabled through features like offset handling and delivery guarantees.\n\nStory continues\n\nStreamSets will also further extend the breadth and depth of IBM's Data Fabric and Data Integration capabilities through enabling the design of streaming data pipelines. It will complement IBM DataStage and Databand into a deeply integrated offering for data engineers, catering to multiple patterns of data integrated, infused with data observability capabilities. IBM plans to make StreamSets available across all major hyperscalers, including GCP (current) and Azure/AWS (in-progress), as well as on-premises.\n\nwebMethods helps organizations manage the tangled web of systems, applications and data silos within business environments. The webMethods Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) enables users to deploy and execute integrations anywhere, while still including outputs in unified integration flows. This helps global organizations meet local data sovereignty requirements while driving enterprise-wide innovation and taking advantage of centralized management.\n\nIBM plans to extend the webMethods iPaaS to support the IBM integration products, giving current customers a path to multi-cloud hybrid integration.\u00a0 By supporting various patterns of integration, including applications, APIs, events, and B2B, IBM will help enable users to compose modern, unified, and seamless applications and services.\n\nFor more information on StreamSets, click here.\u00a0 For more information on webMethods, click here.\n\nMedia Contact: Hanna Scalzo IBM Media Relations 203-512-5497 smigala@us.ibm.com\n\n1 Source:\u00a0IDC. 1 Billion New Logical Applications: More Background, Apr 2024, US51953724 2 Source:\u00a0IDC.

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 3% With Multi-Decade Payout Growth Streaks",
        "content": "High-yield dividend stocks have consistently attracted the attention of Wall Street investors. These stocks not only provide a steady income stream but also offer the potential for capital appreciation. By reinvesting dividends, investors can benefit from compounding returns, which can significantly enhance portfolio value over time.\n\nAmong the myriad of dividend shares available, a select few stand out due to their impressive track records of dividend growth spanning multiple decades. Three such high-yield dividend stocks boast a yield of over 3% and a remarkable history of consistent payout increases.\n\nHistory shows that dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of the S&P 500 Index, contributing an average of 34% from 1940 to 2023. The power of reinvested dividends and compounding has been substantial. They account for 85% of the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index. So, let\u2019s explore these high-yield dividend stocks that deserve your attention in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiotech giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) boasts a robust lineup of vital pharmaceuticals and promising new treatments and vaccines in oncology, diabetes and other critical ailments. Some of its well-known therapies and drugs include Eliquis to treat blood clots, Ibrance that targets breast cancer, Xtandi that is used to treat prostate cancer and the Covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty, developed in collaboration with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX).\n\nIn its first quarter 2024 report, Pfizer reported that revenue declined 20% to $14.9 billion due to lower Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Yet, non-Covid product sales grew 11% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at 82 cents compared to $1.23 for the same period last year.\n\nPfizer\u2019s massive size provides key operational advantages, including cost efficiencies. The company is on track to achieve its goal of $4 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2024, which is expected to improve operating margins. These cost-cutting measures, along with steps to diversify its product portfolio, are designed to enhance Pfizer\u2019s long-term profitability\n\nImportantly, PFE stock has a long and impressive dividend history. The company has consistently increased its dividends consecutively for 15 years. Currently, PFE boasts a healthy dividend yield of 6.0%. This not only provides a steady stream of income for investors but also demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to shareholder value.\n\nSo far in 2024, PFE stock is down 2.8%, while the shares are changing hands at 11.2 times forward earnings and 2.8 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for PFE stock stands at $30.94, a near 10% upside potential from current price of $28.28.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a name synonymous with healthcare innovation and reliability. The company focuses on consumer health, pharmaceutical and medical technology. With a market capitalization of over $350 billion, Johnson & Johnson is a titan in the industry.\n\nAccording to the first quarter 2024 results, revenues came in at $21.4 billion. That marks a 2.3% upside with an adjusted operational growth of 4.0% year-over-year (YOY). The adjusted EPS of $2.71 represented a robust increase of 12.4% compared to\u00a0the year-ago quarter. And. the company continues to invest heavily in R&D, spending over $3.5 billion or 16.6% of sales in Q1 of 2024.\n\nMany on Wall Street highlight that one of JNJ\u2019s most attractive features is its unwavering commitment to shareholder payouts. In April 2024, the company announced its 62nd consecutive year of increasing its quarterly dividend, a remarkable feat. This latest increase translates to a 4% rise, solidifying JNJ\u2019s position as a top-tier dividend stock with a strong dividend yield of over 3.3%.\n\nYet, JNJ stock is down 6.98% year-to-date (YTD) while the shares are trading at 13.7 times forward earnings and 4.10 times sales. Presently, the 12-month median price forecast stands at $170.00 suggesting an upside potential of\u00a016.3%.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

From mainframes to cloud computing, IBM offers a vast array of IT services and products.\u00a0 This stability, coupled with the company\u2019s reputation for reliable dividend payouts, makes IBM stock an outstanding option for income investors seeking steady returns.\n\nIn late April, IBM reported first-quarter revenue of $14.5 billion up 3% YOY. Diluted EPS came in at $1.68 which was 24% over the same period for last year. The company enjoyed strong demand and growth in the software segment. In particular, Red Hat saw a 9% revenue increase and mid-teens bookings growth.\n\nFurther, investors are noting that IBM has been shifting its focus towards hybrid cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).

Also, IBM is investing in emerging technologies like Quantum computing, which could provide long-term growth opportunities.\n\nTherefore, IBM\u2019s commitment to dividends is a major draw for income investors. Having increased their quarterly payout for 29 consecutive years, IBM currently boasts a healthy dividend yield of over 3.8%. The company\u2019s strong cash position further bolsters the confidence in the sustainability of their dividend payouts.\n\nSince January, IBM stock has returned about 4.5%.

        "content": "Cloud computing has made it easier and more cost\u00a0effective\u00a0for companies to store data online. Businesses no longer have to invest in physical servers and storage space to operate smoothly.\n\nMany tech\u00a0giant\u00a0have rolled out cloud platforms over the years, and other companies specialize in\u00a0keeping those platforms protected. Many cloud computing stocks have delivered exceptional returns over the years, as scalability allows margins to expand rapidly once\u00a0it\u00a0becomes profitable.\n\nCloud computing has been hot for several years, but artificial intelligence is adding more fuel to the fire. Artificial intelligence requires significant computing power and data storage capabilities.\u00a0Cloud platforms help\u00a0to\u00a0enable many AI tools and\u00a0give corporations the opportunity\u00a0to use this innovative technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArtificial intelligence is part of\u00a0the reason that\u00a0the cloud computing market\u00a0is projected\u00a0to maintain a\u00a0compounded annual growth rate of 16.40% through 2029. These cloud computing stocks\u00a0are positioned\u00a0to benefit immensely from AI tailwinds.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the largest cloud computing provider in the industry. Amazon Web Services has almost one-third of the market. The company is also working on a ChatGPT alternative to expand its reach in the AI market.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s\u00a0overall\u00a0sales increased by 13% year-over-year to reach $143.3 billion in the\u00a0first quarter. Those sales include Amazon\u2019s online marketplace\u00a0which\u00a0has helped the company expand into numerous industries. Amazon Web Services notably grew\u00a0at a faster rate\u00a0\u2014 17% year-over-year \u2014 to reach $25.0 billion.\n\nAmazon stock has been on a tear. It\u2019s up\u00a0by\u00a029% year-to-date and has roughly doubled over the past five years. The stock is approaching a $2 trillion market cap and has a 54 P/E ratio. Amazon has several segments that stretch beyond cloud computing. It also offers exposure to groceries, advertising, streaming, gaming and other verticals. Amazon\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with a\u00a0projected 18% upside from current levels.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has delivered a 167% gain over the past five years for patient investors.\u00a0While those returns are\u00a0quite\u00a0good, Wall Street analysts believe\u00a0that the stock can march higher.\u00a0The cloud computing company\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target indicates\u00a0that the\u00a0company can gain an additional 15% from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the company\u2019s revenue is recurring, which offers a good baseline for rising revenue. ServiceNow exceeded guidance in the\u00a0first quarter by reporting $2.6 billion in revenue. That\u2019s a 24% year-over-year increase. More than $2.5 billion of the company\u2019s Q1 revenue was recurring.\n\nServiceNow enables digital workflows and helps companies become more efficient. Customers have been flocking to the Now Platform and they\u2019re also paying a lot of money.\n\nThe company closed eight new transactions with annual contract values above $8 million in the first quarter. It has\u00a0more than 8,100 customers and a 98% renewal rate. Almost 2,000 of the firm\u2019s customers have annual contract values\u00a0that are\u00a0greater than $1 million.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the third largest cloud platform and has been growing\u00a0at a faster pace\u00a0than Amazon. While AWS reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue increased by 28.4% year-over-year to reach $9.57 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only highlight from\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s first quarter results. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year while net income surged by 57% year-over-year.\n\nNet income growth is a big highlight,\u00a0since it prompted the tech conglomerate to offer its first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Alphabet reported a 29.4% net profit margin to close out the quarter, and if\u00a0cost cutting\u00a0measures continue, the firm can\u00a0end up with\u00a0elevated gains in the future.\n\nAlphabet still trades at a reasonable 28 P/E ratio.\u00a0It\u2019s the\u00a0online advertising leader and also one of the leaders in\u00a0cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\u00a0Wall Street analysts believe\u00a0that Alphabet\u00a0shares can\u00a0gain an additional 9% from current levels.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers hardware and software products, but its software segment has been the main growth driver. Cloud services and license support\u00a0made up\u00a072% of the firm\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\u00a0This segment increased by 9%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while Oracle\u2019s other segments reported slight\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0declines.\n\nCloud computing is the defining element of Oracle\u2019s investment thesis.\u00a0Q4 cloud revenue \u2014 IaaS and SaaS \u2014 increased by 20% year-over-year to reach $5.3 billion. Overall\u00a0revenue only inched up by 3% year-over-year to reach $14.3 billion.\n\nArtificial intelligence tailwinds should help Oracle\u2019s cloud platform generate\u00a0a higher percentage of\u00a0total revenue. This development should result in growth acceleration since the lagging segments won\u2019t have as much of an impact.\n\nOracle shares are up by 36% year-to-date and have gained 138% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 38 P/E ratio and offers a 1.13% yield.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has\u00a0been winning\u00a0Wall Street analysts for many years. The stock is currently rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and has a projected 11% upside. Long-term momentum has played a role in bullishness. Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech conglomerate offers exposure to many industries: artificial intelligence, advertising, gaming, business software, social media and others. However, none of those segments are as\u00a0important\u00a0as Microsoft Cloud.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud platform generated $35.1 billion in\u00a0Q3 FY24 revenue, which is a 23% improvement compared to the same quarter last year. Microsoft also reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the board and grew its net income by 20%\u00a0year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot allows the company to expand into numerous industries and presents a compelling long-term opportunity. Copilot is slowly\u00a0being integrated\u00a0across Microsoft\u2019s software products like LinkedIn and other places.\n\nCopilot\u00a0also has a cybersecurity division that\u00a0should increase Microsoft\u2019s presence in that vertical.\u00a0Artificial intelligence and cloud computing both present long-term growth opportunities for Microsoft.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) makes cloud computing safer with its Falcon Platform. Businesses can detect and address threats before they get\u00a0serious\u00a0and fortify their digital defenses.\n\nCloud platforms make it easier to store data and access digital files. While this is a boon for many businesses, putting everything on the web\u00a0also\u00a0makes it a target for hackers.\n\nCybercriminals attempt to infiltrate databases and access sensitive information about customers, people within the company and corporate assets\n\nAs such, the cybersecurity firm generates plenty of revenue.\u00a0Q1 FY25 revenue came in at $921.0 million,\u00a0which\u00a0is a\u00a033% year-over-year increase.\u00a0Crowdstrike\u2019s $3.65 billion\u00a0in\u00a0annual recurring revenue should support additional growth in the upcoming quarters. Net income\u00a0came in at\u00a0$42.8 million compared to a $0.5 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe stock has comfortably outperformed the market. Crowdstrike shares are up by 55% year-to-date and have gained 470% over the past five years.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has been reinventing itself for several years. After\u00a0a lot of\u00a0hard work, the company now finds itself in the center of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nUnlike most cloud computing stocks, IBM still has a reasonable valuation. Shares trade at a 19.6 P/E ratio and offer a 3.85% yield. The stock has gained 28% over the past year.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a\u00a0\u201cModerate Buy\u201d and are projecting a 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $215 per share suggests that IBM can gain an additional 24%.\n\nIBM reported 1%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0revenue growth and 69%\u00a0year-over-year net income growth\u00a0in the\u00a0first quarter.\u00a0Rising profit margins make the stock look more attractive, and the firm is also\u00a0in the process of\u00a0acquiring HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion. This acquisition will expand IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud market share and position it to benefit more from AI tailwinds.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, NOW, GOOG, MSFT and CRWD.

        "title": "The Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of top MBA programs with the highest return on investment and in this article, we will talk about TheTop MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment.\n\nDeclining College Enrollments\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports that college enrollment decreased by nearly 14.6% in the US between 2010 and 2021. Particularly, enrollments at 4-year private for-profit colleges decreased by about 54%. Declining enrollments in colleges is an indication that many high school graduates are either struggling to cope with the financial difficulties that come with a conventional career path or simply failing to see the value of investing in a college degree. According to a survey published by HCM Strategists, 64% of survey respondents who did not wish to attend college did so because of financial reasons. 38% were not willing to attend college due to fears about the cost of college and amassing debt. The remaining 26% believed it was more important to work and earn money in the short term.\n\nIn times past, it was quite common for American students to utilize educational loans in order to secure their future. However, BankRate reveals that 24% of Americans believe that borrowing too much for their education is their biggest financial regret. Consequently, even those capable of obtaining student loans are skeptical about whether or not a college degree is worth the debt. Moreover, increasing interest rates on federal student loans are likely to shake confidence in student loans even further. Recently, the Education Department announced that as of July 1st, the interest rate on new federal student loans would be rising to 6.53%, in comparison to 5.5% currently. In addition, rates on graduate and professional loans will be rising to 8.08%.\n\nDue to the increasing impracticality of college education, many individuals are choosing to supplement their CVs with comparatively affordable and flexible alternatives. One such alternative that has become quite popular is digital education platforms such as Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY) and Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR). While such courses are unable to unlock doors in the same manner as a college degree, they can be used to learn useful skills. Moreover, several renowned companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) now offer professional certifications online through Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) and Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY), allowing users to showcase their skills proficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nMBA Enrollment Trends\n\nDeclining enrollments in colleges isn\u2019t exclusively an American phenomenon. Whilst some countries around the world are currently experiencing an increase in college enrollments, research from GMAC reveals that business school applications are experiencing a decline worldwide. In a survey of nearly 250 business schools, it was revealed that applications to all business school programs fell by almost 5 % in 2023, following a 3.4 % decline in 2022.\n\nThe statistics are even worse for MBA program applications, which fell by 6.5% and 4.9% during 2022 and 2023 respectively. MBA is arguably the most prestigious graduate accreditation offered by business schools. Apart from allowing individuals of non-business backgrounds to pivot their careers towards a management path, an MBA can be a catalyst for career growth. In fact, in 2022, GMAC estimated that MBA graduates working at US companies earn a median annual salary of $115,000. In comparison, those with a bachelor's degree earned a median salary of $75,000.\n\nConsidering this, it might be surprising why fewer and fewer people are inclined to enroll in an MBA, even in comparison to other business school degrees. However, much like college education in general, the financial requisites of an MBA, as well as the risks associated with student debt, have resulted in a decline in MBA enrollment. While the cost of an MBA depends greatly on the institution of study, Education Data Initiative estimates that an average MBA in the US costs $56,850. For top-tier B-schools, this figure is well over $200,000. In addition, most MBA students also have to deal with the financial impact of having to relocate and/or give up work for the course of their degree.\n\nThus, despite the many benefits of an MBA, it has become an unfeasible career path for many working-class Americans. However, much like alternatives that are offered by Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) and Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY), many high-ranked universities now offer online MBA degrees that are both affordable and flexible to the needs of working-class Americans. In addition, most of these degrees can be completed without forgoing your existing job.\n\nOnline MBA: An Alternative to Conventional MBA\n\nAn online MBA degree from the Jack Welch Management Institute at Strayer University has an estimated cost of $35,000, just 62% of an average MBA. It is worth noting that this particular degree was featured in the list of Top 10 Online MBA Programs by both The Princeton Review and Poets & Quants. Strayer University is a subsidiary of Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA), Inc., a company dedicated to providing innovative educational services.\n\nIn late April, Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) announced its Q1 2024 financial results. During the period, the company achieved a YoY increase in revenue of 13.1% to $290.3 million. The majority of revenue was generated through the company\u2019s U.S. Higher Education (USHE) Segment, which comprises of Strayer University and Capella University. The segment yields a revenue of $219.2 million, which was an 11.3% increase from the same period in 2023.\n\nImproved margins in the USHE segment yielded an overall adjusted net income of $26.8 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.11. In Q1 2023, the company posted an adjusted diluted LPS of $0.09, primarily caused by significant losses in its Australia/New Zealand segment, which has since turned profitable. Currently, Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) stock has a forward P/E ratio of 23.15 and is priced at approximately $109.\n\nWhile we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) stock and its potential to generate returns, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nAlthough online MBA is an affordable alternative to in-person MBA programs, the quality of in-person learning is difficult to emulate in an online environment. Thus, individuals looking to enroll in the best MBA programs might find that the highest-paying MBA programs are ones that offer in-person, full-time instruction. One method of figuring out what are the most profitable MBA degrees is to calculate whichMBA school has the best ROI. With that in mind, join us as we look at the top MBA programs with the highest return on investment. The Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment\n\nThe Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of top MBA programs with the highest return on investment, we initially picked out the most highly rated MBA programs in the US. We used rankings from sources such as QS and Fortune to develop a shortlist of 50 universities. To ensure the schools were comparable, we focused only on full-time, two-year MBA programs, which is the most common structure for MBA degrees. Further research was narrowed down to these only.\n\nAmong these highly rated MBA programs in the US, we calculated the average expense using the cost of attendance data provided by each school. To calculate each program\u2019s return we used the median base salary based on the latest available employment reports. Using an expected increase in salary of 3% per year, we calculated each program\u2019s return on investment during the first 5 years of employment.

        "content": "STRASBOURG, France and\u00a0ARMONK, N.Y., June 27, 2024 /CNW/ -- Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale,\u00a0a pioneer in the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2016, invests in cutting-edge technologies. Used every day by its 25,000 advisors, AI freed up nearly 1 million hours of administrative work in 2023 to enable them to continue to best serve their members and clients. IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\nOperating as a sovereign technology bank,\u00a0Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale stands out for its ability to carry out almost all of this IT processing in its own datacenters \u2014 an approach underpinned by the historic collaboration established between the teams of Euro-Information, the mutualist group's technology subsidiary, and IBM (NYSE: IBM).\n\nTo maintain its lead in artificial intelligence, Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale and Euro-Information are expanding their long-term collaboration with IBM via its IBM watsonx platform \u2014 an AI and data platform designed to help businesses develop responsible AI \u2014 deployed on Credit Mutuel's in-house computing infrastructure. This collaboration will make it possible to accelerate and industrialize the deployment of generative AI.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale plans to rely on in-house developments and on watsonx to progressively deploy thirty-five AI use cases in Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel and CIC networks, with planned availability for the first set this summer. The mutualist group is also testing the InstructLab technique, jointly developed by IBM and Red Hat, to allow it to design models specific to its field of activity using its own data.\n\n\"For the past eight years, the success of our collaboration with IBM in artificial intelligence technologies has demonstrated the relevance of our strategy combining mutualist commitment and innovation. With watsonx, the Euro-Information and IBM teams gathered within the Cognitive Factory are working on the industrialization of 35 new use cases to enable our banking advisors to always offer the best possible services to our customers and members,\" indicates \u00c9ric Petitgand, Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\n\"Because banking is a technological business, it is essential to constantly innovate in order to master the technologies of the future. Our collaboration with IBM is all the more strategic as the InstructLab technique will enable us to adapt generative AI to our pioneering commitments to ethical and trustworthy AI that meets the specific needs of our company,\" says Frantz Rubl\u00e9, President of Euro-Information.\n\n\"We are delighted to expand our collaboration with Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale. watsonx will allow them to bring cutting-edge generative AI capabilities to improve the customer experience,\" adds S\u00e9bastian Krause, SVP IBM Corporation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our strategic collaboration with the Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Group and Euro-Information is thus further strengthened around three pillars: technological innovation, acceleration of transformation, and talent development,\" concludes Jean-Philippe Desbiolles, IBM Managing Director for Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n\nGenerative AI for enhanced customer relations with the dedicated local advisor\n\nCr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale has relied since its creation on technology to best serve its customers and members. In collaboration with IBM Consulting, Euro-Information's Cognitive Factory has already massively deployed several cutting-edge artificial intelligence solutions, including for customer experience, risk management and compliance, support for account managers and document understanding.\n\nBuilding on its know-how, Euro-Information will develop 35 AI use cases on an industrial scale, relying on in-house developments and on watsonx. Three initial generative AI solutions are expected to be deployed in the third quarter, enabling advisors to respond even more efficiently to the needs of their customers and members. In addition to MonIA, a broad catalog of AI-based services (document synthesis, transcription of appointments, etc.), they could benefit from templates for replying to customer emails, as well as an AI assistant providing personalized responses to help them with their assignments. A fourth pilot will support the Group's IT development employees.\n\nManaging the value chain for building ethical and trustworthy AI\n\nCr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale, via the Chambre Syndicale et Interf\u00e9d\u00e9rale - its parliament made up of elected members and employees - has adopted a charter for trustworthy AI. This charter sets out commitments that govern the use of AI. IBM's watsonx.governance will help Euro-Information implement them.\n\nIn this context, the governance of the mutualist group places AI at the service of human beings: elected representatives, employees, members and customers. It ensures strict respect for digital privacy. Bringing transparent and documented use of AI, it favors the most sober technological solutions and ensures that the principle of pooling banking and insurance offers is perpetuated to guarantee the interests of members and customers.\n\nThese collective choices are made possible because Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale operates as a sovereign industrial bank. In this respect, almost all IT processing is carried out on its own datacenters located in France and Europe, using software over which it has full control.\n\nPress Contacts\n\nCr\u00e9dit Mutuel Alliance F\u00e9d\u00e9rale: Aziz Ridouan \u2013\u00a0+33 (0)6 01 10 31 69 \u2013 aziz.ridouan@creditmutuel.fr IBM: Ga\u00eblle Dussutour \u2013 +33 (0)6 74 98 26 92 - dusga@fr.ibm.com\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

        "title": "3 Ultra-Cheap Cloud Stocks to Watch in June",
        "content": "Some cheap cloud stocks seem to have been glued to the sidelines amid the impressive rally in tech stocks. Undoubtedly, much of the focus seems to be on the \u201cpick and shovels\u201d types of plays right now, with the AI chip stocks stealing the show. Whether we\u2019re talking about GPUs, CPUs, high-performance memory chips or data center cooling tech, anything that\u2019s involved with AI hardware seems to have permission to surge.\n\nWith some of these AI enablers facing intense volatility to the end of the month, investors may be wondering if it\u2019s a better idea to focus on \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d Though the pick-and-shovel plays may prove great buys on weakness in late June, the AI-savvy cloud stocks also stand out as compelling options for investors looking to broaden AI exposure.\n\nHere are three cheap-looking, lagging cloud stocks that look tempting as investors hit the sell button on the AI trade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) has arguably been one of the most unloved cloud stocks this year. At the time of writing, SNOW stock is down over 47% from its February 2024 peak. With the multi-month Snowflake crash showing no signs of letting up, growth investors seeking value may have a shot at picking up shares at close to IPO prices.\n\nRight now, investors don\u2019t seem at all impressed by the company\u2019s slate of new AI products. Perhaps it\u2019s hard to get a grasp of how capable Snowflake\u2019s models really are as an everyday consumer who doesn\u2019t work with Snowflake directly. After all, Snowflake is an enterprise cloud software play. As Snowflake strikes more deals in AI, though, I\u2019d look to the data-cloud firm as becoming more of an AI enabler whose services extend well beyond just data storage.\n\nWith recent Snowflake data breaches, an unproven rookie CEO at the helm and extreme negative momentum, SNOW stock is up against it. But sometimes, you need to brave blizzards for a shot at extreme undervaluation.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is another less-loved value play that\u2019s looking quite cheap following its post-earnings correction. At writing, IBM stock trades at 19.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) while commanding a 3.87% dividend yield. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find such a capable AI innovator with a P/E multiple trading in the teens, let alone one that yields more than 3%.\n\nUndoubtedly, the initial AI-fueled boom in IBM stock has hit a snag. But it could be an opportunity as investors take a pass on the decades-old tech firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Monday, IBM stock rose 1.5% as the tech sector was hit with another bout of volatility. Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider slapped IBM stock with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and a fresh $200 price target.\n\nWhy\u2019s Schneider so bullish?\n\nSchneider sees more growth on the horizon. Not just any growth, though. Sustainable growth as the firm finalizes \u201cits pivot to long-term growth.\u201d And he is absolutely right. Too many investors may be missing the forest for the trees after that last quarter.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the one company that can put those AI bubble worries to rest. The mega-cap tech firm behind Google Search, Google Gemini and Waymo (an autonomous car project that may very well be best in class) still doesn\u2019t trade at a multiple that\u2019s absurd unless, of course, we\u2019re talking absurdly cheap.\n\nAt writing, GOOG stock trades at 27.6 times trailing P/E. That\u2019s still not expensive for one of the best-positioned companies to profit from the early stages of the AI boom. Alphabet has the talent, the data and the wheels on the road (with Waymo) to disrupt new markets with AI in the near and distant future.\n\nAs impressive as the large language model Google Gemini is in its current state, I\u2019m even more excited about the company\u2019s recent efforts to hit the gas pedal on Google Cloud. As AI plays a bigger role in the public cloud, look for Google Cloud to really start gaining.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C) and Snowflake.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.32 indicates a change of +4.2% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $63.04 billion and $66.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +4.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has only risen 4% this year, compared to the S&P 500's 15% gain and the Nasdaq-100's 17% return. The Dow underperformed the other two major indexes for two main reasons: It only tracks 30 prominent companies, and it's more heavily weighted toward slower-growth industries. It's also a price-weighted index, which arguably makes its less accurate than a market cap-weighted index like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100.\n\nNevertheless, the 30 companies of the Dow -- which are also included in the S&P 500 -- still represent a good starting point to look for stable blue chip stocks. So today, I'll highlight three of those stalwarts that are set to soar in 2024 and beyond: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and IBM(NYSE: IBM). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company. In 2022, its revenue only rose 9% as macro headwinds throttled the growth of its marketplace and cloud businesses. Its investment in the struggling EV maker Rivian also backfired and caused Amazon to post a net loss for the full year.\n\nThat slowdown spooked a lot of investors. But in 2023, its revenue rose 12% as it returned to profitability. That acceleration was driven by the stabilization of its North American and international retail divisions, faster delivery speeds, its expansion into higher-growth overseas markets, and the growth of its integrated advertising business. Its cloud unit, which usually subsidizes its lower-margin retail segment with higher-margin revenue, recovered as more companies upgraded their infrastructure to support bigger workloads, large language models, and new generative AI applications.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 57%, respectively, this year. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 40 times forward earnings, and it could head a lot higher as the macro environment improves.\n\n2. Walmart\n\nWalmart is one of the few brick-and-mortar retail giants that has consistently kept up with Amazon. It accomplished that by expanding its e-commerce marketplace, turning its stores into fulfillment centers for online orders, matching Amazon's prices, and rolling out its own Walmart+ subscription plans to counter Amazon Prime.\n\nWalmart also competes against Costco in the warehouse retail market with Sam's Club, and it operates additional banners and e-commerce sites across 19 other countries. That makes it a lot more diversified than many U.S. retailers.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Walmart's revenue and adjusted EPS both increased 6%. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 4% and 9%, respectively, as its domestic business recovers and its international business expands. The company's stock still seems reasonably valued at 28 times forward earnings, it pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.2%, and it's in better shape than most of its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. IBM\n\nIBM was once considered a dinosaur of the tech industry that had fallen far behind its nimble cloud-based peers. But the company divested its slower-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl in late 2021, expanded its subsidiary Red Hat to develop more hybrid cloud services, and rolled out more AI features.\n\nBy streamlining its business and expanding higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses, IBM started to grow again. In 2023, revenue and adjusted EPS rose 2% and 5%, respectively, even as the cloud market faced tough macro headwinds. In 2024, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 2% and 3%, respectively.\n\nThose growth rates might seem anemic, but they mark a massive improvement from previous years of revenue declines. IBM stock looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings, and its high forward dividend yield of 3.9% should limit its downside potential. Over the long term, its stock could head a lot higher as its hybrid cloud and AI businesses accelerate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "IBM Study: Fan Engagement and Consumption of Sports Shifting, Reveals New Opportunities for Technology Integrations including AI",
        "content": "International sports fans surveyed are optimistic about the impact of technologies like AI on their digital sports experiences. Real-time updates and personalized content rank as top priorities for fans when it comes to how generative AI can enhance following and engaging with sports events. Younger sports fans overwhelmingly embrace AI-powered experiences and digital platforms for sports content consumption and engagement.\n\nARMONK, N.Y., June 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As sports fans worldwide tune in to a myriad of athletic events this summer, new research commissioned by IBM (NYSE: IBM) reveals a growing generational shift and acceptance of technology-driven experiences that will impact the future of sports consumption. IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\nThe international study*, conducted by Morning Consult, gathers insights from more than 18,000 sports fans across 10 countries\u00a0to better understand both how they follow and engage with sports, including live coverage, highlights, and summaries, as well as preferences for future engagement and consumption. The findings confirm that fans are prioritizing\u00a0more personalized and time-saving digital sports content, with the majority recognizing the positive impact technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) will have on these experiences.\n\nThe data also confirms that younger sports fans are more likely to favor AI-enhanced features as they increasingly turn to digital platforms for sports content. Surveyed fans aged 18-29 are using a mobile phone or tablet as their primary device to watch sporting events more often than older fans, with subscription streaming of live sporting events being most popular among the younger age group. More than half (58%) of 18-29 year old respondents also believe AI will have a positive impact on sports.\n\nAlternatively, respondents\u00a0from older age groups remain loyal to traditional methods of consumption, with linear broadcasting being most popular among fans 45+.\u00a0Forty percent of surveyed fans over the age of 55 believe AI will have a positive impact on sports.\n\n\"Fans worldwide are continuing to embrace platforms and solutions that allow them to feel more connected and informed on their favorite sporting events and athletes, and IBM's new study confirms this now includes embracing technologies like AI to deliver these experiences,\" said Noah Syken, Vice President, Sports and Entertainment Partnerships. \"IBM's longstanding portfolio of Sports and Entertainment partnerships aims to deliver on these expectations from fans by putting in the hands of our partners the most advanced IBM technologies from our AI and data platform watsonx.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOther key study findings include:\n\nFans are optimistic about the impact of technology on sports, paving the way for generative AI powered experiences\n\n63% of respondents point to data analytics as having the most positive impact on sports, while 50% of respondents think AI will have a positive impact. When it comes to how generative AI can improve engagement, surveyed sports fans identify real-time updates (34%) and personalized content (29%) as the top priorities.\n\nIndia, UAE and Saudi Arabia rank the highest in countries where fans are prioritizing real-time updates and personalized content powered by generative AI.\n\nFans now prioritize personalized, bite-sized content when it comes to their consumption of sport content\n\nMore than half (56%) of respondents turn to social media for additional sports content; 46% are getting additional content from broadcast/video news while 35% are turning to news articles. 64% of those fans engaging in additional sports content are viewing highlight videos of best moments; 48% are consuming post-match recaps and analysis. Among those engaging in additional sports content, respondents rank summarized content (33%) as their top priority followed by personalized content (26%). Sports fans are watching event summaries more often, with 41% of respondents indicating they watch summaries or highlights weekly; 24% report daily engagement.\n\nYounger fans may be reshaping how consumers experience sports content, as they engage with content via multiple screens and are more likely to favor AI-powered enhancements\n\nYounger fans (18-29) are most likely to view sports highlights through social media over other platforms. When it comes to consuming sports content, fans aged between 18-29 are more likely to rank personalized content as their top priority. Fans aged 18-29 are more likely to rate AI improvements as high priority, with real-time updates (40%) and personalized content (36%) topping the list of priorities.\n\nWhile real-time updates (26%) and personalized content (19%) also top the list of AI improvement priorities among older fans (55+), these respondents are much less likely to consider AI improvements a high priority. Younger fans are also more likely to be using multiple devices while engaging with sporting events than older fans (55+). 10% of younger fans surveyed use three or more devices while watching sports compared to only 2% of older fans.\n\nWhile TV is the most common method for viewing sports, fans are increasingly using multiple devices to follow sporting events\n\n64% of surveyed fans say linear or streaming TV is their top choice for watching sports. 31% of respondents say they are most likely to watch a live sporting event on linear broadcast; 28% say they use a subscription streaming service and 23% use a free streaming service\n\nSubscription streaming of live sporting events is most popular among younger fans aged between 18-29. Mobile devices are a noteworthy alternative for watching sports, with 20% of consumers reporting it is the top way they watch sporting events and 38% saying it is their second most likely options. 28% of surveyed sports fans use at least two devices while watching sporting events; 24% report they use at least two devices while listening to sports\n\nFans between 18-44 are more likely to be using three or more devices. Respondents rank multi-tasking as the top reason for using multiple devices\u00a0when consuming sports, followed by finding more game information while watching or listening to the sport.\n\nTo view the full study, visit: https://newsroom.ibm.com/image/IBM+Global+Sports+Attitudes+and+Behaviors+Report+June+2024.pdf\n\n*Study Methodology This survey was conducted in May 2024 among a total sample of 18,082 sports fans 18+ in the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, India, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia.

        "content": "ServiceNow\u2019s NOW workflow solutions have been getting adopted by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. NOW\u2019s initiatives to expand AI-powered capabilities in its portfolio have been a game changer in this regard.\r\n\r\nNOW is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. The enhanced capabilities are helping it to rapidly expand its footprint in the insurTech, strategic portfolio management, cloud management, talent development and public sector domains.\n\nInnovative Portfolio Driving NOW\u2019s Clientele\n\nIDC expects worldwide spending on AI solutions to grow to more than $500 billion by 2027. ServiceNow\u2019s innovative portfolio and expanding Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities make it well-positioned to benefit from this trend. Its total addressable market is expected to hit $275 billion in 2026, driven by GenAI.\n\nNOW\u2019s Prospects Bright On Rising TAM ServiceNow\n\nImage Source: ServiceNow\n\nThrough its Washington, D.C. platform update, ServiceNow introduced a host of cutting-edge features aimed at streamlining operations, enhancing productivity and advancing the adoption of GenAI across various sectors.\r\n\r\nIn May, it unveiled new AI capabilities to foster talent development. Solutions like Now Assist for HR Service Delivery use GenAI to answer and act on questions related to talent development. Its Digital End-User Experience solution helps improve employee productivity and satisfaction while reducing costs.\r\n\r\nNOW has added enhancements to Contracts Management Pro, Security Operations and Field Service Management solutions. The new ServiceNow Project RaptorDB provides businesses with the speed and flexibility needed to thrive in the modern AI-driven landscape.\r\n\r\nThe innovative AI-powered portfolio is helping NOW rapidly expand its clientele. ServiceNow ended the first quarter of 2024 with 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV).\r\n\r\nGenAI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in ServiceNow\u2019s history in the first quarter of 2024. Gen AI products were in seven of the company\u2019s top 10 deals, and NOW closed seven deals over $1 million in ACV in the reported quarter.\n\nStrong Partner Base Aids NOW Stock's Prospect\n\nA strong partner base that includes the likes of Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, International Business Machines IBM, Infosys and Equinix is strengthening NOW\u2019s AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nServiceNow has expanded its collaboration with Microsoft. The new ServiceNow Now Assist and Microsoft Copilot integration brings the power of two GenAI assistants into one seamless enterprise experience, making it easier to create value for enterprise workers and for employees to unlock new productivity avenues.\r\n\r\nServiceNow unveiled AI avatars leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s Avatar Cloud Engine speech, large language model (LLM), and animation technologies that bring digital characters to life using generative AI.\r\n\r\nNOW and IBM are combining the Now Platform with IBM watsonx to boost productivity for mutual customers and partners. ServiceNow will also incorporate watsonx.ai and IBM Granite foundation LLMs into its Now Assist GenAI experience for ServiceNow customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nServiceNow's\u00a02024 Estimate Revisions Positive\n\nFor 2024, ServiceNow expects subscription revenues to be $10.56-$10.575 billion (up $20 million from the previous guidance), which suggests a rise between 21.5% and 22% from 2023 on a GAAP basis. At constant currency, subscription revenues are expected to grow 21.5% over 2023.\r\n\r\nServiceNow expects the non-GAAP subscription gross margin to be 84.5% and the non-GAAP operating margin to be 29%. Moreover, the free cash flow margin is expected to be 31%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.88 billion, indicating 21.31% growth year over year. The consensus for earnings is pegged at $13.51 per share, up 2.03% over the past 30 days and indicating a 25.32% year-over-year increase.\n\nConclusion\n\nServiceNow shares have returned 4.7% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s gain of 22.8% and the S&P 500\u2019s 15.6%. It has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions including persistent inflation that has led to lengthening in deal closure timings. The Value Style Score of F also suggests stretched valuation in the near term.\n\nNOW Underperforms Industry Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNevertheless, ServiceNow\u2019s innovative portfolio and expanding GenAI offerings are expected to help it continue winning customers. A strong liquidity position with a cash balance of $8.8 billion and robust free cash flow generating ability ($3.3 billion estimated in 2024 compared with $2.7 billion reported in 2023) make the stock an attractive pick.\n\nNOW\u2019s FCF To RISE Y/Y ServiceNow\n\nImage Source: ServiceNow\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a Growth Style Score of A, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

The company's earnings report is expected on July 24, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.17, indicating a 0.46% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.58 billion, up 0.67% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.90 per share and a revenue of $63.04 billion, representing changes of +2.91% and +1.91%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for IBM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Companies need to find new ways to manage them\n\nBy Sarah Murray\n\nOriginally published by The Financial Times on FT.com\n\nAt IBM, the holistic approach extends beyond company walls to deepening the talent well from which it can draw. For example, its SkillsBuild free education programme focuses on communities that have traditionally been under-represented in the tech sector.\n\nAnd in 2016, IBM began removing the four-year degree requirement from many of its job postings. \"We tested it out by hiring people without the four-year degree and they were very successful,\" says Nixon-Saintil. \"So we now prioritise in-demand skills over specific degrees, and we can get more applicants and talent to fill those roles.\"\n\nFor Yoshino, the backlash against DEI leaves plenty of room for manoeuvre. \"There's so much that companies can do that travels under the banner of DEI that would still be perfectly legal,\" he says. \"For chief diversity officers it's finding that sweet spot.\"\n\nBut he sees that task as critical. \"There are broad irreversible trends in society,\" he says. \"For me, the writing is on the wall as to how we're going to have to manage a globally connected society.\"\n\nContinue reading here\n\nImage courtesy of The Financial Times\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Quantum Stocks to Buy Before the Masses Mobilize",
        "content": "AI is still the talk of the town, but prudent investors know when to look forward and seek new catalysts for the next technological breakthrough\u2014and quantum computing is fast becoming the next big thing. Thanks to the potential to accelerate current computing technologies, the sector is slowly gaining traction, and keen-eyed investors are already looking for quantum stocks to buy.\n\nTo the uninitiated, quantum computing aims to utilize the law of quantum mechanics to increase computer calculation speeds by a factor of millions or even billions.\u00a0However, the technology in its current form is not yet commercially viable, though remember, people said the same thing about AI a few years ago.\n\nThe opportunity lies here: companies are joining the quantum race, and many will eventually strike gold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at three quantum computing-related stocks that can get you front-row seats to the latest technological revolution\u2014and the returns that come with it. To get my list, I used the following criteria to screen for companies operating in the quantum computing market:\n\nPositive YOY growth in full-year operating cash flow, A high percentage of revenue is spent on R&D.\n\nI sorted the list based on the R&D expense-to-revenue ratio from highest to lowest to find companies willing to bet the farm and win the race.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, everyone knows the tech giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, many may not be aware of its continuous success in breaking through the constraints of being just another online store.\n\nThe company has taken different paths in building its tech empire. Amazon Web Services, its metered, pay-as-you-go API, and on-demand cloud computing have seen some success. They also offer Braket Direct, a platform that allows researchers and software developers to reserve and utilize quantum computing technologies.\n\nAmazon also announced a quantum computing chip late last year that can reduce potential errors in computational processes by a factor of 100 (or 99% in layman\u2019s terms). This is an incredibly important stride in quantum computing, as the increased computation speeds can result in increased errors.\n\nAmazon\u2019s R&D spending, tagged as \u201cTechnology and infrastructure\u201d in its financials, seems to be bearing fruit. It reached $85.62 billion in FY\u201923, representing 14.89% of its total revenue. In addition, the company\u2019s operating cash flow grew from $46.75 billion to $84.95 billion\u2014more than enough to spend on its quantum computing efforts. This makes Amazon one of the most attractive quantum stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is one of the biggest tech giants today and among several that stand at the forefront of modern technology.\n\nThe company is no stranger to innovation. Alphabet recently entered the AI arena with Gemini, a generative AI based on the multimodal large language models of the same name. While Gemini is still catching up to ChatGPT, the company\u2019s efforts in quantum computing are a whole other story waiting to be told.\n\nSycamore, a quantum processor developed by Google\u2019s Artificial Intelligence division, claims to have reached \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d by completing a task in 200 seconds that would take 10,000 years on a classical supercomputer. The company reached a significant milestone in 2023 after reducing logical qubit error rates to 10-2.\n\nAlphabet also launched XPRIZE, a global competition to develop quantum computing algorithms that can demonstrate problem-solving capabilities for real-world applications. Coupled with its long-term goal of building a one million-qubit supercomputer that could hasten the race towards quantum computing, real-life application may be just around the corner.\u00a0Investors looking into quantum stocks to buy can\u2019t go wrong with GOOGL.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet spent $45.43 billion on research and development, or 14.77% of its total revenue. During the same period, its operating cash flow grew from $91.49 billion to $101.75 billion.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnyone working in a corporate setting may have encountered International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) at least once daily. The company is famous for its hardware and software products in many corporate offices and businesses. However, there is more to what they do.\n\nIBM is a strong proponent of the development of quantum computing. In 2023, the company published a paper claiming it had developed a quantum error-correcting code 10 times more efficient than previously established methods. It also laid out a roadmap for quantum computing, showcasing its commitment to developing the technology.\n\nThe company also has a long-standing partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to accelerate quantum computing research, workforce development, and education in New York. This partnership unveiled the world\u2019s first-ever IBM quantum computer in the university\u2019s Voorhees Computing Center Chapel. It partnered with the University of Melbourne and released the Qiskit quantum computing software stack.\n\nIn 2023, the company allocated around 11.31% of its revenue to research & development. Meanwhile, IBM\u2019s cash flow increased from $10.43 billion to $19.93 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford\u00a0held long positions in AMZN and GOOGL.

In June alone, the \"Magnificent Seven\" (the previously cited list, swapping in Broadcom for Tesla) are on average up 7.5%, but the rest of the index is down -0.5%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. On Tuesday, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple stock equated to half of the index\u2019s total returns, he adds.\n\nThis unprecedented level of concentration is leaving some portfolio managers nervous. \u201cThey're biting their nails. Because the bottom line is, if you are not in this, you're not getting your return,\u201d Silverblatt told Fortune.\n\nhttps://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/B7gnW/4/\n\nThat\u2019s because the version of the index that makes no distinction between the market cap of the companies has grown just 4% this year. Moreover, the share of the S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages is declining, down to 47% on Monday from 92% in January, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe darling of tech darlings remains Nvidia, which briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable company this week. With a market capitalization of about $3.1 trillion as of Friday morning, its stock is up over 170% year to date. At the peak of its frenzy on Tuesday, it was more valuable than the entire stock market of France or that of the U.K., or the whole oil and gas industry. That same day, one-third of the index\u2019s returns were from the company alone. \u201cIt\u2019s unheard of,\u201d says Silverblatt. \u201cThe closest we can get to that level of impact [on the index] from one company is IBM in the 1980s, when that new product, PCs, were coming out.\"\n\nSo, how long can this growth last? Silverblatt says he wouldn\u2019t bet his money on Nvidia generating these types of returns every year. For him, it\u2019s not a question of if it loses its chip monopoly, it's a matter of when. But, ultimately, whoever eventually usurps Nvidia is likely to be another tech company that needs chips: \u201cIt's going to stay in the family, shall we say.\u201d\n\nLooking more closely at IBM, in the early 1980s, it was topping the index and towering over competitors at a two-to-one ratio, according to the New York Times. By 1985, its portion of the index was 6.4%\u2014about equal to Apple\u2019s today. The company began to lose its monopoly over personal computers once Apple announced the Macintosh in 1984. Today, IBM ranks about 51st on the index, and represents just 0.35% of the weight. Its market cap is 5% that of Apple\u2019s.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief of The Kobeissi Letter, told Fortune all waves of internet innovation \u201ctypically come with a bubble,\u201d and he anticipates there will be a pullback period in which weaker players are \u201cweeded out.\u201d Nonetheless, he predicts that the large-scale tech stocks are to remain the leaders of the market, and doesn't envision anyone dethroning Nvidia in the near term.\n\nSo, in the near term, is this level of disproportionality concerning?\n\nWell, the top three stocks alone can move the market significantly. \"Concentration is a risky situation\u201d and that makes \u201ceverybody nervous,\u201d adds Silverblatt. If, for example, Nvidia were to lose the gains it has made this year overnight, the S&P 500 would have to come down approximately 4.5%, according to his calculations. \u201cThe market's going to have to absorb that.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "McDonald's Ditches AI Drive-Thru Voice Technology. What Could This Mean for SoundHound AI Stock?",
        "content": "McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) recently announced that it was ditching its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice ordering technology powered by International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM). Instead, the fast food giant will look to replace the technology with an alternative solution by the end of the year.\n\nLet's look closer at McDonald's decision and what impact it could have on SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), whose voice-powered AI technology has been making a lot of inroads in the restaurant space lately.\n\nA potential McDonald's replacement\n\nMcDonald's decision to end its partnership with IBM for automated order-taking technology after a two-year trial comes as a surprise, as the restaurant chain sold IBM the technology powering the solution back in the fall of 2021. McDonald's originally purchased an AI voice start-up called Apprente in 2019 and integrated it into a venture called McD Tech Labs, which it later sold to IBM. Since that deal, it has been testing the technology, which it has deployed at more than 100 locations.\n\nThe voice-ordering technology will be shut off at all locations by July 26 of this year. When the technology was first rolled out, McDonald's said it was about 85% accurate and that it could take 80% of orders. However, with social media, some of the tech's larger screw-ups became viral, such as it adding ketchup packets and butter to a sundae and water order.\n\nMcDonald's chief restaurant officer Mason Smoot told franchisees the company was happy with the trial but that there was \"an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoundHound is a potential logical choice as a replacement for IBM, as the company has gained a lot of traction in the restaurant space with its AI-powered drive-thru voice ordering technology and other industry-specific applications. These include its Smart Ordering platform, which takes orders and answers questions from inbound phone calls, as well as its Employee Assist solution, which acts as a copilot across an employee's headset to help answer questions they may have, such as how to clean the ice cream machine.\n\nSoundHound has struck deals with a number of large quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains, including White Castle, Jersey Mike's, Five Guys, Noodles & Company, and Chipotle Mexican Grill, along with top restaurant fintech companies such as Toast, Olo, and Square. As such, it is certainly a viable contender to replace IBM as McDonald's new voice AI-powered ordering technology partner.\n\nHowever, SoundHound is not the only candidate. Wendy's is using Alphabet's Google Cloud to power its Fresh AI platform that it is testing at some of its drive-thrus. Meanwhile, QSRs such as Del Taco, owned by Jack in the Box, Rally's, Checker's and CKE have used solutions from companies such as Presto Automation, Hi Auto tech, OpenCity, and Valyant AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Alphabet could be the favorite to win the deal, as McDonald's and Google Cloud struck an agreement last December to apply generative AI solutions across its restaurants worldwide. However, even with the Wendy's deal, voice AI is still not Google's core competency, and if SoundHound has the better solution, it could still win the McDonald's deal.\n\nTime to buy SoundHound stock?\n\nGiven McDonald's recent deal with Google Cloud, SoundHound likely isn't considered the favorite to win the deal, but if it does, it would help validate the company as the leader in the voice AI space, and the stock would certainly pop on the news. The fact that McDonald's isn't rushing into a new deal right away and looking to explore alternatives is thus good news, and SoundHound will likely get a chance to show off its technology to the fast-food giant.\n\nTrading at an over 20 times forward price to sales (P/S) multiple, shares of SoundHound are not cheap. However, the company has been growing its revenue rapidly, and it has built up a large backlog of business. Meanwhile, a McDonald's super-sized catalyst could be down the road. SOUN PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOpportunities like McDonald's and the inroads it's making into other industries and devices outside its core automobile and restaurant verticals can help the stock move from here. While SoundHound has a lot of potential, it still remains a speculative investment, given its valuation and the fact that it is still in the early innings of its growth phase. As such, any investments in this growth tech stock should be sized accordingly, given the risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "International Business Machines (IBM): One of the Worst Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Worst Dividend Aristocrat Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other dividend aristocrat stocks.\n\nDividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Achieving and maintaining a dividend streak this long is a tough nut to crack. That is why, among the approximately 6,000 stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, only around 67 companies have earned the distinction of being called dividend aristocrats. This strong dividend growth track records imply that these companies were financially stable enough to sustain their payouts during two significant financial crises: the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides this, these companies have also shown strong performance relative to the broader market over the years. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has outperformed the wider market with lower volatility since its inception in 2005. Recently we covered the list of the 25 Best Dividend Aristocrats to Buy according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts have closely observed the performance of dividend aristocrats in the past and in recent times. In a January 2019 blog post titled \u2018Dividend Growth Strategies and Downside Protection\u2019, Phillip Brzenk, global head of multi-asset indexes, analyzed how dividend growth strategies perform, particularly in times when the market experiences declines. He said that since the end of 1989, there have been six calendar years when the broader market posted negative performance. Interestingly, in each of these years, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader equity benchmark by an average of 13.28%. Moreover, they managed to achieve a positive total return in three of those challenging years. He further said, the aristocrats outperformed the market in 53% of instances, with an average outperformance of 0.16%, when their performance was observed on a monthly basis.\n\nAs mentioned above, dividend growth stocks have performed better than the overall market. Since its inception in 2005 up until September 2023, the dividend aristocrats index achieved a total return of 10.35%, surpassing the broader market's return of 9.54% during the same timeframe. Additionally, the dividend aristocrats exhibited lower volatility, at 15.35%, compared to the market\u2019s 16.31%. This indicates that the prices of these stocks are more stable and less prone to frequent changes, demonstrating their relative resilience.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, analysts are now turning their attention to different aspects of dividend investing. For taxable investors, dividends can be less favorable compared to share repurchases. Additionally, focusing on dividends limits diversification since around 60% of U.S. stocks and 40% of international stocks do not pay dividends. As a result, portfolios that emphasize dividends are significantly less diversified than those that do not consider dividends in their design. Less-diversified portfolios tend to be less efficient due to a higher potential range of returns without any corresponding increase in expected returns, assuming the exposure to common factors remains constant. Moreover, emphasizing dividends often leads to an overinvestment in U.S. equities, causing a home-country bias and further reducing diversification.\n\nAccording to this analysis, dividends are a tax-efficient method for returning capital to shareholders. However, investors continue to favor these equities due to their solid performance and the reliable income they offer. Although dividend aristocrats are strong companies with consistent dividend growth, some are less favored by analysts due to factors like industry challenges, macroeconomic conditions, and specific business issues.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor our list, we scanned a list of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. We then ranked these stocks according to their average analyst ratings from Yahoo Finance, where a higher score signifies the worst rating. The \"Recommendation Rating\" is a way to assess stocks. It uses a scale from 1 to 5, with each number indicating a different recommendation:\n\n1. Strong Buy\n\n2. Buy\n\n3. Hold\n\n4. Underperform\n\n5. Sell\n\nFrom this ranking, we selected the stocks with scores of 3 or more.\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nAverage Analyst Rating Score: 3.5\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a New York-based technology company that specializes in AI, automation, and hybrid cloud solutions. on April 30, the company declared a 0.6% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.67 per share. This was the company's 29th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of June 14, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.95%.\n\nThough International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has raised its dividends for nearly three decades, its dividend growth has remained slow. Over the past five years, it has raised its dividends at an annual average rate of 1.9%. In terms of revenue growth, the company faces significant challenges in its different segments. For instance, in the first quarter of 2024, its consulting, financing, and infrastructure businesses reported declines on a year-over-year basis. This could cause a blow to the company's overall revenue, considering its consulting business is a major competitive advantage for it. In addition, despite spending heavily on acquisitions, the company's revenue growth has been disappointing. In 2019, it bought Red Hat for $34 billion, and last year, it spent approximately $6 billion to acquire nine companies. If the $6.4 billion deal for HashiCorp is finalized, it will be IBM's latest addition to its portfolio.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital also mentioned these business headwinds in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOther bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM\u2019s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.\u201d\n\nOne of the main reasons for this slow revenue growth is despite having a strong history with AI, the company hasn't made this technology its core focus in the past. However, things have changed since 2020 when Arvind Krishna became the company's CEO. Since then, AI played a role in driving IBM's sales growth and the stock has surged by roughly 46%. Despite having a relatively strong balance sheet and steady cash flow generation, IBM faces challenges due to its debt position. The company's debt grew by $3 billion since the end of 2023 to $59.5 billion in Q1 2024. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio comes in at 2.7, which raises concerns for income investors. Moreover, its payout ratio of 66.8% is also high.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) shares reached an all-time of around $206 per share in 2013 and haven't reached that level again. Although the stock nearly hit $200 earlier this year, it has since fallen back. Analysts have maintained a consensus Hold rating on the stock, which makes it one of the worst dividend aristocrat stocks on our list.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds at the end of Q1 2024 indicated that 49 funds held stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), down from 50 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $1 billion.\n\nOverall IBM ranks 10th on our list of the worst dividend aristocrat stocks to buy. You can visit 20 Worst Dividend Aristocrat Stocks According to Analyststo see the other dividend aristocrat stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Get ready. You are about to discover three tech stocks to buy that have not participated in the broader tech sector\u2019s upward momentum in 2024.\n\nAs a result, we believe these tech shares offer significant long-term profit potential. Year-to-date (YTD), the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has advanced over 17%. Now it hovers near all-time highs. Tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have led the rally. However, a number of tech stocks have been left behind.\n\nAs a result, these overlooked companies currently trade at a discount, providing attractive entry points for long-term investors. Despite the recent share price weakness, many of these companies have strong profitability metrics and positive analyst outlooks. With that information, let\u2019s explore three tech stocks to buy, worthy of your attention in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) technology heavyweight Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is first. The company\u2019s Customer 360 platform brings companies and customers together. It offers a range of services from sales and service to marketing and commerce. Many of our readers follow CRM stocks as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow 30.\n\nRecently, Salesforce reported financial results for Q1 of fiscal year 2025. The company delivered $9.13 billion in revenue, an 11% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Subscription and support revenue, a significant component of Salesforce\u2019s business, grew by 12%.\n\nHowever, investors were not pleased Salesforce\u2019s metrics fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. This was the first time since 2006 that Salesforce missed revenue expectations. Investors were concerned about Salesforce potentially being left behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Yet, InvestorPlace.com contributor Alex Sirois has recently reported on this. Salesforce management has been investing in the AI safety and research company Anthropic, known for its large language model (LLM) Claude.\n\nIn addition, Salesforce has been actively pursuing strategic deals and partnerships to enhance its offerings and expand its reach. One notable development has been the creation of the Zero Copy Partner Network. This includes major tech players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), privately-held Databricks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far in 2024, CRM stock has declined over 12%. The shares are trading at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.4x and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.2x. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains optimistic with a 12-month median target that signals a 30% upside potential.\n\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic design and test solutions provider Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) makes electronic equipment, instruments and components segments. It serves customers in a wide range of industries, including communications, government, automotive, industrial and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Q2 of 2024, Keysight Technologies reported revenue of $1.216 billion. Although the number was above the high end of their guidance, it represented a 13-14% decline on a core basis compared to the previous year. Orders for the quarter were $1.219 billion, down 8-9%. Looking ahead, Keysight\u2019s management expects Q3 revenues to be between $1.180 billion and $1.200 billion.\n\nAlso, Keysight Technologies has been active in expanding its capabilities and market reach. Recently, the firm was designated as a technical service provider for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in automotive cybersecurity and software regulations. Also, management introduced a pulse generator software for its FieldFox handheld analyzers, supporting numerous advanced applications.\n\nSince January, KEYS stock has lost around 14%. Currently, it is changing hands at 23.3 times forward earnings and 4.6 times sales. Despite the decline in Keysight share price, analysts expect a potential advance of around 19% in the next 12 months.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, SkyworkSolutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in the design and manufacture of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors.\u00a0The company serves various end markets, including mobile, automotive, industrial, infrastructure and the IOT.\n\nRecent earnings showed revenues of close to $1.05 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.55. The gross margin for the quarter was 45%, down 140 basis points sequentially, reflecting the seasonally weakest period for SWKS.\n\nLooking ahead, Skyworks Solutions expects revenue of $900 million for the June quarter. And the gross margin is projected to improve to 45-47%, with further expansion anticipated in the remainder of 2024.\n\nSkyworks Solutions has been actively expanding its pipeline and initiating new programs.\u00a0For instance, management has secured several audio system-on-chip (SoC) designs with major players like Sony Group (NYSE:SONY)\u00a0 and Samsung Electronics. Recently, it has also showcased several AI-enabled phones, highlighting the potential for AI to drive a meaningful replacement cycle in the smartphone market.\n\nYTD, SWKS shares are down over 5% and are changing hands at 17.9 times forward earnings and 3.7 times sales. Investors could regard any potential dip in SWKS stock as an opportunity to invest for the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Buying groups are made up of multiple stakeholders with different priorities who influence key purchasing decisions both inside and outside of organizations, which can make it difficult to deliver a consistent message over a long sales period. Traditionally, understanding how to adjust that message across the right channels to guide buying groups to purchase is challenging and often leads to inefficient marketing spend.\n\nWPP Open for B2B is\u00a0powered by watsonx \u2013 an AI and data platform designed to accelerate the impact of AI across businesses \u2013 and will bring together market-leading, proprietary capabilities from both organizations.

We are excited to create and use these new, powerful and trusted AI solutions to deliver a force multiplier for B2B marketing.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPenry Price, Vice President at LinkedIn, said: \"With success in B2B requiring customers to reach between 6 to 10 stakeholders, building relationships and 'collective confidence' among the entire buyer group is key. We are looking forward to working with WPP and IBM to determine how our unique knowledge of buyer groups can help inform WPP Open for B2B and help clients deliver more effective advertising campaigns.\"\n\nWPP and IBM have used watsonx to build capabilities for the platform including:\n\nAI-powered Buying Group Brain\u2122 \u2013 a WPP AI model\u00a0that can\u00a0more accurately identify target buying groups in a B2B client account,\u00a0built with IBM watsonx.ai and trained on\u00a0trustworthy data from the client and third parties through IBM watsonx.data.\u00a0It can also inform how marketers deliver personalized and consistent experiences across channels and across the duration of a long-term influencer campaign.

        "title": "3 High-Yield Heavyweights to Anchor Your Portfolio for the Long Haul",
        "content": "When building a retirement portfolio, focusing on the best high-yield dividend stocks to buy can result in better long-term outcomes than timing the market. That\u2019s because when a company offers both a high dividend yield and performs well year-over-year, the value of an investor\u2019s position can compound rapidly. Luckily, record and dividend histories exist for all publicly traded companies in the U.S., which can help inform buying decisions.\n\nMoreover, these high-yield dividend stocks can help hedge cash savings against inflation, as they are exceptional at maturing at a rate higher than the average 2% to 3% that the Federal Reserve aims for. Thus, for investors looking to use their money to make more money in the future, companies with a history of stable performance and upholding shareholder dividends are the way to go.\n\nAs such, here are three of the best high-yield dividend stocks to buy and continually re-invest earnings in for a bigger retirement account.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough cigarettes may be going out of fashion, with some predicting they\u2019ll be completely gone in 10 years,Altria Group (NYSE:MO) doesn\u2019t seem to be burning out any time soon. On the contrary, the company has found several ways to change the narrative around its operations and become part of the push toward a smokeless future.\n\nAltria is now rushing to make its NJOY e-cigarettes and ON! nicotine pouches more competitive to draw in customers who are accustomed to smoking. It is also working to expand its heated tobacco portfolio, which delivers a similar yet potentially less risky experience to smoking.\n\nThese efforts have enabled the company to confidently and consistently increase its dividend for 54 years straight, making it a member of the famed Dividend Kings. Up 11% year-to-date and offering an 8.77% dividend yield, MO stock is one of the best high-yield dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nFrom supercomputers to quantum mechanics and even nanotechnology, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a staple of the American technology industry. Over its lifetime, IBM stock has been one of the most stable and respected dividend-yielding stocks, and its reputation has stayed strong amid both artificial intelligence and quantum computing hype.\n\nThe company currently offers a 3.95% dividend yield, which is fairly generous in comparison to most major tech companies \u2014 some of which offer no dividend. It also currently trades at a 19.2x price-to-earnings ratio, which suggests IBM stock is potentially undervalued by the industry average of around 24.82x for information technology companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, IBM has several high-potential irons in the fire, with highly developed quantum computing projects, artificial intelligence and several nanotechnology programs actively contributing to the advancement of science today. As such, IBM is certainly one of the best high-yield dividend stocks to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nNordic American Tankers (NAT) Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harbor\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech Wrzesien\n\nNordic American Tankers (NYSE:NAT) is a relatively new and expanding shipping company. Its tankers provide crude oil and petroleum transport to major energy companies and extraction wells across the world. As part of its operations, NAT operates 20 ships, all of the Suezmax classification, meaning they are the largest possible size that can cross the Suez Canal.\n\nCurrently, the company offers a whopping 10.93% dividend yield, which is exceptionally enticing for those looking for consistent percentage increases. Even better for investors, the company\u2019s leadership recently reiterated that the long-term growth of its dividend and shareholder returns is its top priority.\n\nMoreover, the company kicked off 2024 with healthy earnings. Its net profits for Q1 2024 of 2024 came in at $15.1 million, stemming from the company\u2019s valuable tankers, which earned $34,320 per day per ship on average. Each ship in the NAT fleet undergoes vetting for performance and technical conditions by oil company boards. Above all else, NAT is exceptionally attractive, thanks to maintaining one of the lowest debt levels among publicly traded oil tanker companies, which keeps its cash flow less restricted.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Ever get your McDonald's order mixed up at an AI-powered drive-thru? The experiment behind the fast food giant's current automated order taker will soon be coming to a close.\n\nMcDonald's confirmed late Monday that it decided to end a global partnership with IBM, which has been testing this artificial intelligence technology at select McDonald's drive-thrus since late 2021.\n\nThat doesn't mean you'll never encounter some sort of chatbot while picking up fries on your car ride home again. While the IBM partnership for McDonald's current automated order taker test is winding down, the Chicago-based company suggested that it wasn't ruling other any other potential AI drive-thru plans down the road \u2014 pointing to \u201can opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur work with IBM has given us the confidence that a voice ordering solution for drive-thru will be part of our restaurants\u2019 future,\u201d McDonald's said in a prepared statement this week \u2014 adding that it would continue evaluations to \u201cmake an informed decision on a future voice ordering solution by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nNumerous fast food chains have begun exploring the implementation of AI across operations over recent years, with many pointing to possibilities of maximizing speed and cutting costs.\n\nIn the U.S., Wendy\u2019s partnered with Google Cloud to develop \u201cWendy\u2019s FreshAI\" chatbot. White Castle teamed up with SoundHound AI with a goal of bringing voice-powered AI technology to more than 100 restaurants by the end of 2024. And a handful of Panera, Arby's and Popeyes locations have brought OpenCity's \u201cTori\u201d voice assistant to their order lanes.\n\nBeyond America, Popeyes U.K. also launched its first AI-powered drive-thru (dubbed \u201cAl\u201d) last month, after the company said a pilot program reported 97% accuracy.\n\nSuccess for AI-powered drive-thrus has been mixed. McDonald's automated order taker with IBM received scores of complaints in recent years, for example \u2014 with many customers taking to social media to document the chatbot misunderstanding their orders.\n\nUnnamed sources familiar with the technology told CNBC that the technology has had difficulty interpreting different accents and dialects, among other challenges affecting order accuracy.\n\nMcDonald's declined to comment about the automated order taker's accuracy. In an initial statement, IBM said that \u201cthis technology is proven to have some of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate in some of the most demanding conditions,\" but did not immediately respond to a request for further comment about specifics of potential challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Armonk, New York-based tech company also said that it is currently \u201cin discussions and pilots\u201d with several other quick-serve restaurant clients interested in the automated order taker.\n\nAccording to trade publication Restaurant Business and CNBC, which obtained a memo sent to franchisees last week, the automated order technology will be shut off in McDonald's locations testing it \u201cno later than July 26, 2024.\u201d\n\nBoth IBM and McDonald\u2019s maintained that, while their AI drive-thru partnership was ending, the two would continue their relationship on other projects. McDonalds said that it still plans to use many of IBM\u2019s products across its global system.\n\nIn December, McDonald's launched a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud. In addition to moving restaurant computations from servers into the cloud, the partnership is also set to apply generative AI \u201cacross a number of key business priorities\u201d in restaurants around the world.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s is removing AI-powered ordering tools from its drive-thru restaurants in the US after customers shared experiences of the technology going wrong online.\n\nThe system, developed by IBM, uses voice recognition to process orders and had been used at more than 100 McDonald\u2019s restaurants since first being introduced as part of a test in 2021.\n\nBut its reliability had come into question after a number of videos and posts appeared online detailing ordering mishaps such as bacon being added to ice cream and hundreds of dollars worth of chicken nuggets being added to an order.\n\nAccording to trade publication Restaurant Business, which first reported the news, McDonald\u2019s has instructed franchisees to remove the tech by the end of July as it will not be extending the trial.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a statement, the US food giant said: \u201cWhile there have been successes to date, we feel there is an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly.\n\n\u201cAfter a thoughtful review, McDonald\u2019s has decided to end our current partnership with IBM on AOT (automated order taking) and the technology will be shut off in all restaurants currently testing it no later than July 26 2024.\u201d\n\nThe company added that it remained confident that the technology would be a part of the firm\u2019s future.\n\nThe trial comes as concerns persist in some quarters over the potential impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and its potential to reshape the workplace and jobs market.\n\nIn May, the first major scientific report on advanced AI safety included the technology\u2019s potential to disrupt jobs among the potential systemic risks of the technology, if it was not monitored and developed responsibly.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has turned to a consortium that includes International Business Machines Corp. and Discover Financial Services to help win federal funds to develop quantum technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Stocks Rise After Solid US Industrial Production: Markets Wrap Citi Pitches Money-Moving \u2018Crown Jewel\u2019 as Central to Revamp Flesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan These Are the World\u2019s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024\n\nThe companies will work together with Boston Consulting Group and P33, a nonprofit started by the governor\u2019s sister and former Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, to develop quantum tools to fight financial fraud. The plan is part of a bid to win $70 million from President Joe Biden\u2019s Tech Hubs program established as part of the 2022 Chips and Science Act.\n\nGovernments, consumers and financial firms are currently picking up a tab of $2 trillion in money laundered every year, more than $40 billion in identity scams and $30 billion in credit card fraud, the consortium said in a white paper this month.\n\nWinning the federal money is key to helping fund Quantum Shield, the fraud-detection project that\u2019s part of Illinois Tech Hubs bid, said Brad Henderson, chief executive officer of P33. The effort is unique because it seeks to use quantum technology, instead of binary traditional computers, to solve a real-world problem. Quantum technology relies on \u201cqubits\u201d and can store data in multiple forms \u2014 ones, zeros, both, or something in between.\n\n\u201cWhenever I read anything on quantum computers, it\u2019s all like qubits, qubits, qubits,\u201d Jay Gambetta, vice president of IBM Quantum, said. \u201cI love qubits, don\u2019t get me wrong, but if we are going to do something that matters for the industry, we need to bring algorithms to industry-relevant proof of concepts.\u201d\n\nThe funds will be used for proof of concept, phase 1 of the project, according to Henderson. If Quantum Shield can prove in its pilot that it can reduce fraud it will likely prevail, he said. Phase 2 would be scaling it, he said, adding that hundreds of millions of dollars would be needed for that.\n\nThe Chips and Science Act authorized $10 billion over five years for the Tech Hubs program, which aims to draw in private capital to boost science and technology manufacturing across the country. But lawmakers have only appropriated $541 million of that funding, setting up a steep competition among hundreds of applicants.\n\nThe Biden administration designated 31 hubs last year, including Illinois\u2019 The Bloch Tech Hub, making them eligible for up to $75 million each. Funding announcements are expected this summer. Henderson of P33 expects the results in the next four weeks or so.\n\nStory continues\n\nTackling financial fraud is an urgent issue, with the use of AI propelling bad actors, said Rob Gillis, vice president at Discover. Since the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, ransomware attacks increased 76% and phishing scams surged by over 1,000%, according to the white paper.\n\nPreventing fraud means detecting subtle oddities in large datasets, while also trying to avoid flagging legitimate transactions.\n\n\u201cAt times, existing classical fraud detections may not be able to detect those subtle anomalies,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cI think the industry is appreciating that it\u2019s going to require new and sophisticated defenses.\u201d\n\n\u2018Natural Place\u2019\n\nIllinois has been trying to position itself as a hub for new technologies. Pritzker, the billionaire scion of the Hyatt hotel chain, has made quantum a priority. The governor, often mentioned among the bench of Democrats who may one day wage a White House bid, this year passed a budget that includes $500 million to position the state as a leader in semiconductors, quantum and artificial intelligence.\n\nMatt Langione, managing director and partner at BCG, said Chicago is a \u201cnatural place\u201d for the consortium, which also includes Mastercard, University of Chicago, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. There\u2019s the Chicago Quantum Exchange, a hub for advancing the technology, as well as strong engineering and tech programs at the University of Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Northwestern University.\n\nThe third-biggest US city has one of the country\u2019s longest quantum network \u2014 124 miles (200 kilometers) connecting the US Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory. Illinois also has four of the nation\u2019s 10 quantum centers, the most of any state.\n\n\u201cChicago has found itself in a unique position where it\u2019s got industries that can leverage this technology,\u201d Gambetta said.\n\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) closed the latest trading day at $169.50, indicating a +0.17% change from the previous session's end. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.49%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.95%.\n\nThe technology and consulting company's stock has climbed by 0.11% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.05% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 3.71%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of IBM will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on July 24, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.17, marking a 0.46% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $15.58 billion, indicating a 0.67% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIBM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.90 per share and revenue of $63.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +2.91% and +1.91%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for IBM. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. IBM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, IBM is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.09. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 14.69.\n\nOne should further note that IBM currently holds a PEG ratio of 4.17. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.6.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 157, placing it within the bottom 38% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "McDonald\u2019s is taking a step back from artificial intelligence\u2014at the drive-thru, at least.\n\nThe fast-food giant has ended its two-year partnership with IBM, which saw it testing AI to take people\u2019s voice orders at drive-thru kiosks. The company has been testing the AI at over 100 restaurants, but now plans to remove the systems by the end of next month.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been successes to date, we feel there is an opportunity to explore voice ordering solutions more broadly,\u201d said Mason Smoot, chief restaurant officer for McDonald\u2019s USA, in an email obtained by trade publication\u00a0Restaurant Business.\n\nIntroducing AI into the order-taking process was meant to speed up the overall turnaround time for customers. It\u2019s unclear if that goal was achieved, but the email from Smooth did note that the company planned to make \u201can informed decision on a future voice-ordering solution by the end of the year\u201d and said the company was optimistic about the practice, despite some public missteps.\n\nTikTok is laden with videos of confused customers getting items they never asked for, ranging from nine sweet teas to two pats of butter. \u201cCream packet? No! I just want a large water and a cup of ice cream. Not a ketchup packet! Oh, my God,\u201d one customer exclaims to the bot in one video\u2014which can be heard asking questions in the background.\n\nIBM is also working with chains including Wendy\u2019s, Hardee\u2019s, and Dunkin' on using AI to take drive-thru orders.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has had a long-standing interest in AI. In 2019, it bought AI firm Apprente with the goal of speeding up order-taking. That same year it bought Dynamic Yield, which specializes in personalization and decision logic technology, and took a 10% stake in Plexure, the vendor for the McDonald's app. McDonald's has a new internal team called McD Tech Labs, and the company has said it plans to expand its presence in Silicon Valley, hiring additional engineers, data scientists, and tech experts.\n\nDynamic Yield's tech, for instance, promotes different menu items based on time of day or weather, boosting customer spending.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM recently announced that it has collaborated with The All-England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) to introduce Generative AI technology in the upcoming Wimbledon tournament. The collaboration is likely to emphasize the integration of advanced technology to enrich the overall experience of tennis fans, coaches and players globally.\r\n\r\nLeveraging its AI and data platform, Watsonx, IBM aims to provide tennis fans with real-time updates about the progress of the world's leading players during the tournament. They can access the information by simply logging into Wimbledon App and wimbledon.com.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the Wimbledon experience for fans both in person and digitally, IBM has launched the 'Catch Me Up' feature. The feature allows users to choose player cards per their preference. Additionally, it also showcases player cards for both pre- and post-match sessions, enhanced with AI-generated player stories and analysis, where pre-match analyzes the recent performance to understand the likelihood of winning and post-match provides key statistics and highlights.\r\n\r\n\u2018Catch Me Up\u2019 utilizes IBM's Granite large language model to produce AI-generated text on the Watsonx platform. The model has been trained on the Wimbledon editorial style to deliver compelling, insight-driven storytelling at scale. This is likely to help Wimbledon expand the reach of its content to both new and existing tennis fans globally.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration will also enable Wimbledon to attract more international audiences by streaming a diverse range of matches, including wheelchair events and exclusive coverage of both men\u2019s as well as women\u2019s singles tennis matches. This will be featured on IBM Slamtracker, a redesigned digital match center that is available on both the Wimbledon App and wimbledon.com. Leveraging Watsonx, Slamtracker will provide match previews and post-match reviews.\r\n\r\nLast month, IBM surveyed different countries to understand the technological impact of AI. It was found that the majority of tennis fans believe that AI will have a positive impact on multiple aspects of the sport. Consequently, the company aims to leverage AI to reach to a wider audience with informative content.\r\n\r\nThis new partnership with the AELTC is expected to generate a significant amount of revenue for the leading American multinational technology company. It is also expected to strengthen IBM\u2019s leading position in the generative AI domain.\r\n\r\nShares of IBM have gained 23.1% over the past year compared with the\u00a0 industry\u2019s growth of 16.5%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Rank\n\nIBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nKey Picks\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) at present, delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.43%.

        "content": "SaaS stocks to buy remain timeless picks for savvy investors.\n\nAs the business world pivots from on-premise solutions to cloud-based services, the allure of SaaS stocks is undeniable. However, while the SaaS sector continues to grow at a heartening pace, it\u2019s also fiercely competitive. Many have tried and failed to solidify their positioning in the software space, making it imperative to back the right companies to capitalize on the burgeoning trend.\n\nThat said, the article discussed three of the top SaaS stocks to buy, exemplifying the sector\u2019s potential for explosive revenue growth. These companies have successfully fortified their positions and enjoy a dominant market position. Moreover, with AI shaping the SaaS industry, now\u2019s the perfect time to invest. These SaaS stocks, in particular, are leveraging AI, offering robust opportunities for forward-thinking investors. Additionally, with the current market volatility, it\u2019s an opportune time to add these stocks to your portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSaaS Stocks to Buy: ServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a premier choice among SaaS stocks, justifying its price tag with its stellar operating performance. Its platform enables companies to streamline workflows efficiently, enhance efficiency, and deliver unmatched customer experiences. Moreover, its loyal customer base positions ServiceNow as a key player in the SaaS industry, making it one of the best bets in today\u2019s digital economy.\n\nIts business has grown rapidly, boasting 28% revenue growth over the past five years and a 77% EBITDA over the same period. Also, its profitability profile is a visual treat, with a 5-year average gross margin and net income margin of 78% and 9.1%, respectively. \r\nIts robust cloud platform has proven incredibly sticky with its customer base, boasting an impressive 98% renewal rate. Moreover, it attracts the biggest companies in the world, with over 8,100 customers, including roughly 85% of the Fortune 500.\n\nAlso, its ability to attract big-ticket clients\u20142,000 customers with annual contracts exceeding $1 million\u2014highlights its significant market impact.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we\u2019ve seen a pullback in its value recently, making it an opportune time to bet on it at current prices.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA lot of the recent turbulence in the software space is attributable to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Following a relatively tough quarter for CRM, the repercussions rippled through the industry, creating attractive entry points in several SaaS stocks. Despite the recent lull, there\u2019s plenty to like about CRM as a long-term SaaS play, given its authoritative presence in the customer relationship management realm.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, its massive bet on generative AI is another major growth catalyst for its business.\u00a0\u00a0Its strategic deployment of its Data Cloud and Einstein 1 Platform is already bearing fruit in this regard.\n\nData Cloud has helped centralize customer data, streamlining the process for over 1,000 enterprises that have embraced the solution. Remarkably, 25% of the company\u2019s high-value deals now include Data Cloud services. Also, the firm has integrated IBM\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) sophisticated large language models into the Einstein 1 Platform, bolstering its analytical power. Hence, despite market skepticism, CRM\u2019s forward-thinking approach strategically positions it for future growth, making it a wise bet for discerning investors.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nOver the years, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has seamlessly transitioned from its traditional software licensing model to a robust subscription-based SaaS platform. This major shift in its strategy has paid many dividends, adding to its colossal free cash flow base exceeding $6.6 billion.\u00a0 Moreover, the move towards a subscription model has allowed the software giant to innovate and improve its offerings consistently. Also, with it commanding a massive 60% market share in the app development space, it creates a strong network effect that enhances its competitive edge.\n\nOf late, we\u2019ve seen Adobe looking to differentiate itself further from its competition through aggressive AI investments. Particularly, AI algorithms such as Content-Aware Fill and Adobe Sensei have enabled the firm to effectively scan truckloads of consumer user data to enhance service delivery and functionality.\n\nFinancially, the firm remains as solid as ever, as evidenced by its recent quarterly performance. Its first-quarter (Q1) report showed adjusted earnings of $4.48 per share, besting market expectations by nine cents. Additionally, revenue surged 10.2% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.31 billion, beating forecasts by $20 million. As we advance, it expects annual revenues to fall in the $21.4 billion to $21.5 billion range, ahead of analyst expectations.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Pre-match content will include analysis of recent performance and likelihood to win predictions, and post-match it will include key statistics and highlights. The feature will also create longer-form daily summaries of play.\n\n'Catch Me Up' was built using IBM's Granite large language model (LLM) to provide AI-generated text using the capabilities of the watsonx platform. The model has been trained on the Wimbledon editorial style and will be monitored by the All England Club. The new feature is designed to help Wimbledon scale its content to both new and existing tennis fans globally, as well as provide fans access to timelier, curated coverage across ladies' and gentlemen's singles matches which are often happening simultaneously.\n\nThis year, Wimbledon will also use generative AI to provide coverage of a broader range of matches than was previously available, including wheelchair events, to offer more to Wimbledon's diverse international audience. This will form part of a redesigned digital match centre, known as IBM Slamtracker, available on the Wimbledon App and wimbledon.com.

Generative AI allows us to scale our ability to provide different types of content for fans wherever they are in the world in a way that's personalised for them. This year's new Catch Me Up feature will make it easier for fans to follow the key storylines as they emerge throughout The Championships.\"\n\nJonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for IBM, said: \"The new Catch Me Up feature is an exciting example of how we can use the power of generative AI to deliver compelling, insight-driven storytelling at scale. For 35 years, IBM and Wimbledon have been co-creating solutions that make fans feel more connected to all the on-court action, and our new research confirms they are beginning to understand the positive impact technologies such as generative AI can have on their digital experiences.

        "content": "3 Tech Stocks With A History Of Reliable Dividends\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFor those seeking a blend of growth and reliable income, tech stocks with long-standing dividend histories are particularly appealing. Here, we highlight three such companies \u2014 International Business Machines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Cisco Systems \u2014 known for their consistent dividend payouts and solid financial health.\n\nInternational Business Machines\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) offers comprehensive solutions and services worldwide, segmented into Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing. The Software division provides hybrid cloud and AI platforms to aid clients in their digital transformations. Consulting focuses on integrating strategies and operations technology. The Infrastructure segment offers both cloud-based and on-premises server and storage solutions, while the Financing segment helps clients acquire IBM products and services.\n\nIBM has increased its dividend for 28 straight years, with the latest raise in April bringing the quarterly payout to $1.67 per share, or $6.68 annually, yielding 3.95%.\n\nOver the past year, IBM reported $62 billion in revenue and $8.18 billion in net income.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) delivers data-centric solutions globally, helping clients manage and utilize data effectively. Operating in segments such as Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, and Financial Services, HPE supports a range of IT needs from cloud services to data analytics.\n\nHPE has maintained dividend payments for a decade. The company pays a regular dividend of $0.13 per share, or $0.52 annually, with a yield of 2.49%.\n\nThe stock has climbed 24% year-to-date, driven by steady EPS beats. Over the last twelve months, HPE generated $28.3 billion in revenue and $1.8 billion in net income.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a leading provider of networking and IT solutions worldwide, offering products in switching, enterprise routing, wireless access, and computing systems.\n\nCisco has been consistent in its dividend payments for 14 years and has increased them for 13 consecutive years. In February, Cisco raised its quarterly dividend by 2.6% to $0.40 per share, or $1.60 annually, yielding 3.51%.\n\nOver the past year, Cisco reported $55.3 billion in revenue and $12.1 billion in net income.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share, indicating a change of -0.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.32 indicates a change of +4.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $15.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $63.04 billion and $66.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +4.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Payout Powerhouses: 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Just like in arguably most sports, balance is everything. The same applies to dividend stocks to buy. Yes, the high-flying growth names tend to attract the most attention. Frankly, there\u2019s nothing wrong with pursuing select names in the space. However, you also want to lean into enterprises that provide passive income.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the sport of baseball since we\u2019re in the season for it. A good team that makes it consistently to the playoffs and go far \u2013 and not just teams that occasionally show flashes of brilliance \u2013 have balanced lineups. Yes, all teams put their best players at the top of their lineup. But if the bottom of the lineup is pure garbage, that would become a liability.\n\nUnlike other professional sports leagues, baseball seasons almost seem eternal. Of course, that\u2019s just hyperbole but the point is, averages come to bite you if you have an unbalanced team of a few superstars and the rest being rank amateurs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing with finance. Stick with your growth winners. But also show some love to dividend stocks to buy.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig-box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) presents a solid case for dividend stocks to buy because of everyday needs. In a retail ecosystem increasingly shifting toward e-commerce, companies in the space must fight for relevance. Target offers a huge advantage because of its one-stop-shop business model. No, it\u2019s not a unique concept. However, TGT tends to be a step above in terms of ambiance (you know what I\u2019m talking about).\n\nYou also can\u2019t argue with the financials. Between the quarter ended July 31, 2023 and Q1 of fiscal 2025, the retailer posted an average earnings per share of roughly $2.23. This tally included a small miss in Q1. Nevertheless, the average earnings surprise clocked in at 23.6%, demonstrating consistent relevance to the customer (guest).\n\nIn terms of passive income, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 3%. That\u2019s above the consumer staple sector\u2019s average yield of 1.89%. Even better, the company has been raising its payout for the past 53 years. That makes it one of the strongest ideas for dividend stocks to buy.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical giant that also features specialties in medical technology, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) represents a powerhouse in healthcare. JNJ ranks among the best dividend stocks to buy thanks to its alignment with a permanently relevant narrative. It\u2019s just the reality that humans get sick. And people tend to put their resources into health because wealth doesn\u2019t mean much without the former.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s just a blunt way of stressing the viability of J&J \u2013 it is what it is. You can\u2019t argue with the results. While the healthcare space is competitive and the company doesn\u2019t have a perfect record, it managed to post an average EPS of roughly $2.56 in the past four quarters. This tally translated to an average earnings surprise of 1.6%.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not exactly exciting but it gets the job done. For passive income, J&J offers a forward yield of 3.41%. In contrast, the healthcare sector\u2019s average yield comes in at 1.58%. Further, the sector juggernaut enjoys 63 years of rising payouts. That makes it a reliable idea for dividend stocks to buy.\n\nShell (SHEL) Shell logo on a gas station in Iceland. SHEL stock\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe hydrocarbon sector might not necessarily be everyone\u2019s first choice for finding viable dividend stocks to buy. While the ecosystem is undoubtedly vital to the functioning of the global economy, social and political forces are pushing renewables. That leaves Shell (NYSE:SHEL) in a bit of a quandary, even though the company is investing in clean energy tech such as hydrogen.\n\nStill, the cynical reality is that the world continues to run on oil. Further, geopolitical flashpoints \u2013 whether that be an unexpected dynamic in Europe or the escalation of tensions in the Middle East \u2013 may threaten global supply chains. That could really ramp up the demand and profitability of the entire hydrocarbon value chain.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that even with a conspicuous miss in Q2 2023, Shell\u2019s average EPS hit $1.98 in the past four quarters. The average earnings surprise reached 11.08%.\n\nIn terms of passive income, Shell shells out a forward yield of 3.91%. Also, the payout ratio sits at 32.22%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWhen it comes to technology plays, IBM (NYSE:IBM) isn\u2019t the most exciting due to the lack of robust capital gains. In many cases, the legacy giant has been left behind by other enterprises, which seems odd. Yeah, the company incurred some missteps. At the same time, it commands excellent acumen, especially in relevant fields such as artificial intelligence.\n\nOver time, Big Blue will have its time. For now, IBM intrigues because it\u2019s one of the top dividend stocks to buy. While it\u2019s not exciting in the capital gains sense, the company consistently hits its bottom-line targets. In the past four quarters, IBM\u2019s average EPS reached around $2.44. This translate to an earnings surprise of almost 5%.\n\nWhat that looks like over the trailing 12 months (TTM) is a net income of $8.15 billion. True to form, IBM consistently decides to reward its shareholders, providing a forward yield of 3.95%. Further, the company enjoys a 29-year track record of annual payout increases.\n\nDuke Energy (DUK) The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFundamentally, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) makes a powerful case for top dividend stocks to buy because of its natural monopoly. First, utility giants benefit from the entrenchment of their businesses. Trying to compete in the field is almost impossible for many entities due to steep barriers of entry. Second, Duke specifically benefits from covering certain southern states and the Midwest.\n\nPeople \u2013 particularly young people \u2013 are moving to regions that feature lower costs of living than major metropolitan areas. In that sense, Duke is positioned where the money will be. That\u2019s significant because young people will generally see their income rise. In turn, that promotes more spending and thus economic activity \u2013 elements that indirectly favor Duke.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Duke posted net income of $4.31 billion, translating to earnings of $5.59 per share. A lot of that is going to shareholders. Right now, the company offers a forward yield of 4.05%. That\u2019s above the utility sector\u2019s average yield of 3.75%, which is already high.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s just get it out of the way \u2013 Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is controversial. As a tobacco giant, it\u2019s difficult to frame the company in holistically positive terms. Further, the company seemingly suffers from a relevancy problem. Over the past several years, anti-tobacco organizations have successfully brought the message home regarding the dangers of cigarettes. Thus, smoking prevalence globally has declined.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean the tobacco industry is fading into irrelevance. Many analysts cover PM stock and they rate shares a moderate buy. It\u2019s not a ringing endorsement, per se. However, it\u2019s not a sell recommendation either. Also, these market experts project in fiscal 2024 EPS expansion of 5% to hit $6.31. Further, revenue may rise 4.8% to reach $36.95 billion.\n\nWhat gives? Essentially, Philip Morris has been investing in its cigarette alternatives like heat-not-burn devices and vaporizers. Further, the company is popular with investors because of its commitment to rewarding stakeholders. Right now, the tobacco specialist offers a forward yield of 5.07%. That\u2019s well above the consumer staple sector\u2019s average of 1.89%.\n\nB2Gold (BTG) b2gold (BTG) logo on a web browser enlarged by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdmittedly, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) might not be the best idea for dividend stocks to buy. As a precious metals miner, it doesn\u2019t really have the pricing predictability of a metals streaming or royalty firm. Instead, it\u2019s the equivalent of an upstream energy specialist. A lot of things can go wrong in the exploration and extraction business.\n\nFurther, BTG is also volatile, having lost more than 31% since the start of the year. Obviously, that\u2019s not encouraging to risk-averse investors. However, I keep going back to the fundamental catalyst of the sector: inflation. As the latest May jobs report indicates, U.S. employers basically went on a hiring spree. That means more dollars chasing after fewer goods, which translates to higher inflation.\n\nFinancially, there are concerns obviously. Analysts project fiscal 2024 EPS to slip almost 11% to 25 cents. The top line may also fade by nearly 2%. However, they also anticipate a recovery effort in fiscal 2025, with EPS potentially rising to 42 cents on sales of $2.42 billion.\n\nFor now, B2Gold offers a forward yield of 6.13%. That might tempt some investors due to the underlying inflationary narrative.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Not all dividend stocks are worthy of a royal title like Dividend Duke (a completely made-up term, by the way). Indeed, there are Dividend Kings who have raised dividends by at least 50 straight years, a feat that\u2019s impressive but quite hard to do. Not because dividend payers can\u2019t stand up to challenges (like recessions) thrown their way, but because many firms simply weren\u2019t public in the early-to-mid 1970s to be eligible for the Dividend King title.\n\nThe future is uncertain, but that doesn\u2019t mean firms with decades (perhaps less than five decades) can\u2019t find their way to 50 consecutive years of dividend raises. We\u2019ll check out three Dividend Dukes that may, one day, rise to become Dividend Kings.\n\nTheir growth rates may also lead to better appreciation potential relative to some older, growth-lacking Dividend Kings. These dividend stocks that can help make your portfolio that much more noble.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend for 49 consecutive years as of this writing. It\u2019s en route to becoming a Dividend King next year despite the recent inflation-related challenges that have pressured MCD stock. McDonald\u2019s may have lost some of its reputation as a high-value fast-food chain. It used to be cheap to get a meal, especially with coupons.\n\nNowadays, you can expect to pay around $30 or more to get a meal (and treats) for two. Of course, you could knock a few dollars if you have the loyalty app, which allows you to score discounts or spend points. Still, the customers want the firm to \u201croll back\u201d prices for good rather than just running limited-time value promos.\n\nInstead of cutting prices and operating margins, McDonald\u2019s may be able to command higher prices if it improves the quality of its food. Arguably, it\u2019s already doing this with recent changes to its burgers. And with healthier Happy Meal offerings now widely available, perhaps McDonald\u2019s can also make its adult menu items a bit healthier (or less calorie-dense) to win more business.\n\nWith a nice 2.63% dividend yield and Dividend King status in sight, MCD stock looks nothing short of delicious.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has to be one of my favorite Dividend Kings. The company has raised its dividend for around 30 years straight. Though still more than two decades away from Dividend King status, I find the technology firm to be a strong candidate to benefit from the continued rise of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a strong quarter delivered at the start of the year, IBM stock seems to be known as an AI play for business nowadays. Still, I think there\u2019s way more upside to be had, even after its latest quarterly setback, which caused shares to plunge around 14% off their 10-year highs of over $191 per share.\n\nOne quarterly setback does not mean the AI growth narrative is suddenly off the table. As IBM continues spending on innovation (not just AI but quantum computing as well), its stock stands out as a fantastic deal for upside seekers and income investors alike. The dividend yield sits at 3.92% at the time of writing.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is a defense company with a fairly modest 1.94% dividend yield. The firm has hiked its dividend every year for about 33 years. Given the steady and lowly-correlated nature of the defense scene (0.64 beta, which entails above-average market risk), GD stock looks destined to become king in 18 years.\n\nWith the stock coming off all-time highs, investors may wish to watch the $81 billion defense play. Its combat and marine systems businesses have been incredibly robust of late. With a strong backlog and no shortage of orders, General Dynamics may be able to move to even higher highs in the second half, especially if management can improve margins across the board. Further, the Gulfstream business jet may provide enough catalyst to help General Dynamics extend its run.\n\nWhen writing, GD stock trades 24.1 times, trailing price-to-earnings, which seems too cheap for such a stellar blue chip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "Top 5 AI Stocks That Also Pay Dividends\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nDespite impressive returns and surging valuations, Wall Street analysts continue to expect further upside to AI stocks amid a growing appetite for generative AI software and IT infrastructure solutions worldwide. Analysts at UBS estimate that revenues in the AI industry will grow from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027, at a 72% CAGR during the period. AI infrastructure spending, on the other hand, is estimated to grow at a 50% CAGR to hit $195 billion by 2027.\n\nThe AI and tech industry is now alluring for income investors, too. Tech companies, loaded with strong cash flows and powered by raging demand, have started announcing their dividend policies to woo investors. Earlier this year, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Salesforce announced their first-ever dividends.\n\nThere are many opportunities in the AI industry for those looking for that sweet spot between share price appreciation and steady dividend checks. Let\u2019s look at some of the top AI stocks that also pay dividends.\n\nIBM\n\nIBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) doesn't get much limelight in the AI arms race, but analysts believe the company has a lead in AI-related innovation thanks to its Watson platform\u2019s natural language processing skills. The company is also expanding its AI footprint through partnerships and collaborations. Last month, IBM partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to allow users to access Watsonx AI features and its data platform. IBM also partnered with Palo Alto Networks, enabling the California-based cybersecurity company to acquire IBM\u2019s QRadar Software as a Service (SaaS) assets.\n\nIBM has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years, a feat only a few in the tech industry could match. With an over 3.9% yield, it\u2019s a high-yield dividend stock.\n\nEquinix\n\nEquinix Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is on investors\u2019 radar since the company provides data center solutions central to the AI ecosystem. As companies begin to develop and deploy generative AI applications, analysts believe Equinix is well-positioned to benefit from the rising demand for data centers and AI infrastructure solutions. Last month, investment firm UBS recommended investors pile into stocks that are exposed to the \"AI value chain,\" including data centers and semiconductors. Equinix was one of the firm\u2019s recommendations. UBS expects AI infrastructure spending to reach $195 billion by 2027.\n\nEquinix pays a $4.26 per share quarterly dividend for a 2.2% yield. Over the past five years, Equinix\u2019s dividend has increased at a CAGR of 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital Realty Trust\n\nDigital Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:DLR) is another notable data center AI stock that pays dividends. The Texas-based real estate investment trust (REIT) operates over 300 data centers across 25 countries. Last month, UBS Global Research added Digital Realty Trust to its list of stocks poised to benefit from the increasing AI infrastructure spend. Some of the top names in the tech industry, including Nvidia, AMD and Oracle, are using Digital Realty Trust\u2019s data center and cooling solutions. During its first quarter earnings call, Digital Realty Trust\u2019s management announced it was selected to host one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in its Denmark data center.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Digital Realty Trust\u2019s funds from operations (FFO) was $1.67, surpassing the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.62. The company maintained its 2024 FFO guidance of $6.60-$6.75. Since 2005, Digital Realty Trust has increased its dividends at an annual growth rate of 10%. The stock's dividend yield is 3.26% as of June 11 market close.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nTexas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) is in the news after billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliot Management opened a $2.5 billion activist stake in the semiconductor company, pushing the company to set a target of free cash flow (FCF) per share of $9.00+ by 2026. In an open letter to Texas Instruments\u2019 board of directors, Elliot said Texas Instruments\u2019 shareholder returns have \"lagged peers\" over the years. The fund also said Texas Instruments should decrease its spending, a move Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley called \"unrealistic,\" citing the company\u2019s fabs expansion plans in Texas and Utah.\n\nTexas Instruments is one of the industry leaders in the analog chips market, which mainly addresses automotive and industrial chips. Citi analyst Christopher Danely recently said in a note that he sees a recovery in the analog chips market, led by Texas Instruments. Danely also sees an \"upside\" to the company\u2019s revenue guidance.\n\nTexas Instruments is also launching new AI-focused chips and solutions. The company has announced Sitara\u2122 AM62 processors that power AI applications.\n\nTexas Instruments is an attractive income stock for dividend investors with over 2.6% dividend yield and over two decades of dividend growth.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) is seen as a laggard in the AI arms race, but the company is launching a slew of new products to catch up with competitors like Nvidia and AMD. Intel made waves at the Computex 2024 event by revealing Xeon 6 processing chips designed to handle AI-intensive data center workloads. In April, Intel pitched its AI accelerator Gaudi 3 chips as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s H100 to train large language models (LLMs) and process generative AI workloads.\n\nIntel has been paying quarterly dividends since 1992. However, last year, the company slashed its dividend by 65%, its first dividend cut since 2000. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company would be back to growing dividends \"over time\" as he called for a \"prudent\" allocation of capital to increase Intel\u2019s earnings.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Redditors Are Buying These 8 Dividend Stocks For Early Retirement",
        "content": "Redditors Are Buying These 8 Dividend Stocks For Early Retirement\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nYoung Americans have always been allured by the idea of leaving their 9-to-5 grind and enjoying the prime of their lives by the beach and doing what they love. But in recent years, this idea has seen a dramatic rise in popularity. In a recent survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 45.8% of the respondents said they would likely be working after age 62. This metric averaged 55% between March 2014 and March 2020, according to the bank.\n\nThe early retirement movement gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans started working from home and saving money from stimulus checks. In October 2021, St. Louis Federal Reserve economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro estimated that a whopping three million Americans retired early due to the pandemic. However, this phenomenon, also known as \u2018The Great Resignation,' reversed as inflation began to impact American households.\n\nEarly retirement communities such as Reddit\u2019s /FinancialIndependence are still growing. Investing in dividend stocks is often pitched as one of the quicker and safest ways to retire early on Reddit. We scoured several discussion boards on Reddit to see the most popular dividend stocks recommended by investors on the platform for retirement based on their personal experience.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) is a notable dividend stock popular among Redditors looking to live off dividends. Pfizer shares are down about 7% over the past year. The stock yields around 6%, which is high compared to the sector average of about 2.3%. Redditors think Pfizer is going through a post-COVID slump, but it\u2019s poised to rebound on the back of strong growth catalysts in the pipeline. During the first quarter, Pfizer\u2019s revenue from non-COVID products saw an 11% operational growth year-over-year. Pfizer has increased its dividend for 14 straight years.\n\nPhilip Morris\n\nWith 16 consecutive years of dividend growth and a 5% yield, the tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) is a top choice for many Redditors who live entirely off dividends. Amid a decline in the popularity of traditional tobacco products, Philip Morris is aggressively expanding into tobacco-free products. The company plans to generate about two-thirds of its net revenues from nontraditional products by 2030. The company posted strong Q1 results in April and updated full-year 2024 guidance. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.50, surpassing estimates by $0.09, while revenue jumped 9.7% YoY to $8.8 billion, beating the consensus estimate by $350 million. Philip Morris expects its organic revenue growth in 2024 to total somewhere between 7% and 8.5%, up from its previous forecast of 6.5% to 8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMain Street Capital\n\nTexas-based business development company Main Street Capital Corp (NYSE:MAIN) is one of the most popular monthly dividend stocks among Redditors in retirement and dividend communities on the social media platform. Main Street has been paying dividends consistently since 2007 and has upped its dividend every year since 2014.\n\nMain Street\u2019s management said during the Q1 earnings call that the company\u2019s net investment income in the quarter was 54% higher than the monthly dividends the company paid to its shareholders and 9% more than the total dividends paid to shareholders. Total investment income in the March quarter came in at $131.6 million, easily beating the Street\u2019s consensus of $127.9 million.\n\nAltria\n\nReddit\u2019s retirement and dividend communities love Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) because of its dividend yield (over 8%) and impressive dividend growth history (54 consecutive years of increases). Retail investors on Reddit believe the stock is undervalued and poised to grow due to recreational marijuana and tobacco-free product growth.\n\nLast year, Altria completed its $2.75 billion acquisition of NJOY Holdings, an e-vapor products company. Analysts believe growth from the oral tobacco category and vaping products could offset declines from the smokable products segment.\n\nAltria\u2019s valuation is indeed depressed. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 9.05, much lower than the industry average P/E of 17.24.\n\nIBM\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IMB) is one of the most talked-about stocks in Reddit retirement and dividend communities since many Redditors living off dividends have the tech stock in their portfolios. IBM is that sweet spot between dividend income and stock growth, as some Redditors think the company\u2019s cloud and AI business has the potential to boost IBM\u2019s share.\n\nIBM has 29 years of consecutive dividend growth and yields 3.95%. In April, IBM increased its quarterly dividend by 0.6% to $1.66 per share. During the same month, IBM said it would buy HashiCorp. for $6.4 billion. The company stated the acquisition would allow it to expand its hybrid cloud platform for AI. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said IBM has the ability to drive HashiCorp\u2019s growth across its customer base.\n\nRealty Income\n\nCalifornia-based REIT Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is one of the top monthly dividend stocks, having raised its dividends for 29 straight years. Redditors are fond of this high-yield (5.9%) dividend growth stock. Realty Income hiked its monthly dividend by 0.2% on June 11 to $0.263 per share. The company has also increased the lower end of its 2024 earnings guidance. It now expects adjusted FFO per share in the year to come in between $4.15 and $4.21, up from its prior guidance of $4.13 to $4.21.\n\nApple\n\nDespite having a low yield, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the favorite dividend stocks on Reddit, as retail investors on the platform believe the iPhone maker is a solid addition to a diversified dividend portfolio. With excess cash and rising competition, Apple prioritizes shareholder returns more than ever. It has raised dividends every year over the past decade. Earlier this year, Apple hiked its dividend by 4%. It\u2019s still a growth stock, with many analysts betting that Apple\u2019s AI plans will bear fruit. The stock jumped to new highs after Apple\u2019s latest AI-related announcements during the annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nIn the latest note, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo praised Apple\u2019s AI move and said the company could have a competitive edge over peers as it has \"successfully defined on-device AI.\"\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has over six decades of dividend growth, a solid business, and a 3% yield. Redditors believe this old-school, \"boring\" dividend stock is important for any balanced dividend portfolio. Coca-Cola\u2019s organic revenue during the first quarter jumped 11% year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s defensive business makes it an all-weather dividend stock. In May, Goldman Sachs said in a note that Coca-Cola is one of the stocks \"insulated\" from headwinds from wavering consumer spending amid rising inflation.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "AI Aces: 3 Stocks Dealing a Winning Hand in the Artificial Intelligence Game",
        "content": "Right now the Street is enthralled with hardware stocks that are clearly benefiting from the proliferation of AI. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), and, of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are among the names in the latter category that have rallied recently. And so far, large investors have not been nearly as thrilled with software companies that have added AI features. But in an unusual development, I find myself largely agreeing with Cathie Wood\u2019s take on this issue. Last year, Wood said that software stocks would be the next big thing in the AI space, and she predicted that software makers with exposure to AI would generate $8 of revenue for each $1 produced by hardware firms in the space.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not sure if Wood\u2019s ratio will be exactly on target, much more money is indeed likely to be ultimately spent on AI-powered software than on chips and servers. After all, the vast majority of businesses on the planet are likely to eventually buy software with AI capabilities, and that\u2019s simply not the case for hardware. With that said, the trend can indeed be your friend on the Street. Therefore, of the three AI stocks that I\u2019ll recommend in this column, two will be software makers and one will be mostly in the hardware camp.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nTailored to specific sectors, C3.ai\u2019s (NYSE:AI) software allows its customers to easily integrate AI into their operations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the firm reported outstanding first-quarter results as its revenue climbed 20% year-over-year and its net cash used in operating activities sank to $62.36 million from $115.69 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, multiple investment banks were very pleased with the software maker\u2019s results. Northland upgraded AI stock to \u201coutperform\u201d from \u201cmarket perform.\u201d Among the positive news cited by the bank were the acceleration of the firm\u2019s subscription growth, increases in the number of pilot deals that it\u2019s conducting, and higher demand for generative AI. Northland raised its price target on the shares to $35.\n\nAlso upbeat on the shares was Wedbush which noted that C3.ai predicts that it will generate positive free cash flow next year. The bank believes that this guidance suggests that the firm can prioritize its profitability. Wedbush kept a $40 price target and an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the shares.\n\nC3.ai\u2019s shares climbed 50% between April 16 and June 11, indicating that the Street is starting to view the firm as one of the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is adopting an approach to generating revenue from its AI coding tools that I believe could turn out to be quite successful.\n\nTo get its foot in the door with companies, Big Blue is providing its AI-powered Granite tools, which enable coders to work more quickly, for free. But the firm also sells Watson which allows Granite to run more smoothly. The free tools could very well entice many firms to sign up with IBM rather than one of its competitors.\n\nThe approach appears to have worked with the Saudi Arabian government, as the country recently agreed to train its large language model with Watson. The latter agreement could lead to IBM making similar deals with other Middle Eastern governments.\n\nIBM, which also generates a great deal of revenue from sending its consultants to help businesses implement AI, had more than $1 billion of AI-related bookings as of the end of April.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrimarily a hardware play, Arista Networks recently made a move into software that could prove to be a game changer. Specifically, the company unveiled a software-based, AI-powered system that will enable data centers to manage large numbers of switchers, routers, and chips from a single point. The system also allows data centers to \u201cdebug\u201d network problems, the company reported.\n\nAnd with AI PCs set to proliferate, I continue to expect Arista to get a sizeable boost from the hardware that it sells for edge data centers. That\u2019s because I believe that, for AI PCs to exploit their advantages over PCs that utilize AI based in faraway data centers, they will have to obtain information from edge data centers. After all, AI PCs\u2019 advantages are enabled by low latency, and obtaining data from faraway locations increases latency.\n\nIn a note to investors on May 29, British bank Barclays predicted that Arista\u2019s \u201cAI-related back-end revenue\u201d would exceed its guidance of $750 million in 2025. The bank expects the company\u2019s revenue to rise about 15% in both 2024 and 2025, and it kept an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on the shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in ANET.

        "title": "The 3 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Technology firms, both public and private, have been working hard to develop quantum computing technologies for decades. The reasons for that are straightforward. Quantum machines, which harness the quantum mechanics undergirding subatomic particles, have a number of advantages over classical computers. Portfolio optimization and climate predictive algorithms that improve with more complexity are better handled by quantum computers.\n\nU.S. equities markets have surged with the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to create enormous efficiencies and profits for firms across various industries. While AI has brought quantum computing back into the spotlight, a lack of practical ways to scale these complex products has severely dented the performance of pure-play quantum computing stocks, such as IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI).\n\nFortunately, not every public company invested in quantum computing has seen doom and gloom. Below are the three best quantum computing stocks investors should buy in June.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a legacy American technology business. It has its hands in everything from cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and technology consulting services to quantum computers.\n\nThe firm committed to developing quantum computing technologies in the early 2000s and tends to publish new findings in the burgeoning field frequently. In December 2023, IBM released a new quantum chip system, Quantum System Two, that leverages the firm\u2019s Heron processor, which has 133 qubits. Qubits are analogous to bytes on a classical computer. But instead of being confined to states of 0s and 1s, qubits, by way of superposition, can assume both states at the same time.\n\nMoreover, what makes Quantum System Two particularly innovative is its use of both quantum and classical computing technologies. In a press release, IBM states, \u201cIt combines scalable cryogenic infrastructure and classical runtime servers with modular qubit control electronics.\u201d IBM believes the combination of quantum computation and communication with \u201cclassical computing resources\u201d can create a scalable quantum machine.\n\nIBM\u2019s innovations in quantum computing technologies as well as AI has not gone unnoticed either. Shares have risen 31.3% over the past 12 months. The computing giant\u2019s relatively cheap valuation coupled with its exposure to novel, high-growth fields could boost the value of its shares in the long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have given Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) attention and praise over the past 12 months due to its critical role in AI computing technologies. The chipmaker\u2019s advanced GPUs, including the H100 and H200 processors, are some of the most coveted chips on the market. The new Blackwell chips, coming to the market in the second half of 2024, bring to the table even better performance.\n\nThough Nvidia\u2019s prowess in the world of AI captures much of the headlines, the firm has already made inroads into the next stage of computing. In 2023, Nvidia announced a new quantum system in conjunction with startup Quantum Machines. It leverages what Nvidia calls the Grace Hoper Super Chip (GH200) as well as the chipmaker advanced CUDA Quantum (CUDA-Q) developer software.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia released its Quantum Cloud platform, which allows users to build and test quantum computing algorithms in the cloud. The chipmaker\u2019s GPUs and its open-source CUDA platform will likely be essential to scaling up the quantum computing space.\n\nNvidia\u2019s share price has surged 214.2% over the past 12 months.\n\nFormFactor (FORM)\n\nSource: Bartlomiej K. Wroblewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantum computers are complex machines that require all kinds of components. Furthermore, it is vital for quantum systems to operate at extremely low temperatures in order to operate efficiently.\n\nFormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) specializes in developing cryogenic systems \u2013 or systems that are meant to deal with low temperatures. Everything from wafer testing probes to low-vibration probe stations as well as sophisticated refrigerators call cryostats, FormFactor provides. Also, the firm\u2019s analytical probe tools are useful for developing advanced chips, such as NAND flash memory.\n\nWith quantum computing systems and advanced memory chips in greater demand these days, FormFactor could see revenues and earnings rise in the near and medium terms. FormFactor\u2019s share price has surged 77.5% over the past 12 months, underscoring that investors are taking notice of the company\u2019s long-term value.\n\nAt the beginning of May, FormFactor released first quarter results for fiscal year 2024 and topped revenue estimates while EPS came in line with market expectations. The firm expects strong demand for advanced memory chips, such as DRAM, will help propel revenue growth in the following quarters.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Why Is DXC Technology (DXC) on the Acquisition Radar Again? (Revised)",
        "content": "DXC Technology Company\u2019s DXC shares soared 11.5% on Monday as the IT services and solutions provider garnered attention as a potential acquisition target. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters on Monday revealed that Apollo Global Management and Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. KD are considering a joint bid for DXC.\n\nApollo Global Management is an asset management firm, while Kyndryl Holdings is an IT services provider that was created from the spin-off of International Business Machines Corporation\u2019s IBM infrastructure services business in 2021. Upon spin-off, International Business Machines held a 19.9% stake in Kyndryl Holdings, which it later sold in November 2022.\n\nThis is not the first time when DXC has attracted takeover interest. In October 2023, it was approached by a financial sponsor regarding the potential acquisition of the company. In early 2021, it received an unsolicited, preliminary and non-binding proposal to acquire all its shares from the French technology services provider Atos SE. However, both talks didn\u2019t materialize for different reasons.\n\nDXC's current valuation plays a crucial role in its appeal as an acquisition target. The company's stock has been trading at a one-year forward P/E multiple of 6.30X, significantly lower than the Zacks Computer - IT Services industry\u2019s 33.21X, making it a potentially lucrative investment for acquirers.\n\nThis attractive valuation multiple is a result of a 20.4% year-to-date (YTD) decline in DXC\u2019s share price. At the closing price of $18.34 as of Jun 11, the stock traded 36.5% lower than the 52-week high of $28.89.\n\nDXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus\n\nDXC Technology Company. price-consensus-chart | DXC Technology Company. Quote\n\nTransformation Efforts Attract Suitors\n\nWe believe that DXC\u2019s sustained efforts toward transforming itself from a struggling, highly leveraged company to a high-growth, business-oriented firm have made it a lucrative takeover target.\n\nDXC was formed by the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation (\u201cCSC\u201d) and the Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE, which was completed on Apr 1, 2017. CSC, prior to the completion of the merger, took an additional debt. This amplified DXC\u2019s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden while limiting its scope for investing in growth opportunities.\n\nTo overcome this situation, DXC resorted to debt refinancing and divestment, as well as a spin-off of non-core assets. The strategy significantly reduced its outstanding debt level to $3.82 billion as of Mar 31, 2024 from $10.33 billion as of Jun 30, 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nDivestment and spinning off non-core assets have improved DXC\u2019s focus on its core businesses. Also, it enhances the firm\u2019s ability to execute acquisition strategies across high-growth businesses, including enterprise software-as-a-service, technology security solutions and autonomous driving.\n\nThe trimmed business is likely to help DXC focus on reviving its financial performance, which has been hurt by a slowdown in IT spending. Additionally, a low-leverage balance sheet will provide it with financial flexibility in investing in growth areas.\n\nWhat Should Investors Do Now?\n\nWhile the prospect of an acquisition might create a buzz around DXC Technology, it is essential for investors to look beyond the headlines and consider the underlying fundamentals of the company. DXC\u2019s declining financial performance, high debt levels, competitive pressures and limited growth prospects all paint a challenging picture.\n\nDuring its recently reported financial results, the company provided dismal revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. It hinted that cautious spending by clients in a challenging macroeconomic environment would hurt its fiscal 2025 top-line performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.14 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 8.8%. The consensus mark for earnings has been revised 25% downward to 60 cents per share over the past 30 days, which calls for a 4.8% decline from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe potential for an acquisition does not necessarily translate into guaranteed gains for current shareholders, and the associated speculation can often lead to increased volatility and risk. Also, like previous takeover talks, if the acquisition does not materialize, the stock could suffer a significant decline.\n\nConsidering the ongoing challenges faced by DXC, along with a risk of speculated bid failure, it is wise to wait to invest in the stock until we see some clarity on its growth prospects. DXC currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nWhile Kyndryl Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), International Business Machines and Hewlett Packard Enterprise each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Lynn Conway, leading computer scientist and transgender pioneer, dies at 85",
        "content": "Lynn Conway was the bravest person I ever knew.\n\nIt wasn't merely her struggle to make her way in the male-dominated computer engineering world of the 1960s and 1970s. It was that she did so, with spectacular success, while contending with her own psyche, her family and her bosses at IBM to complete her transgender transition.\n\nConway died Sunday, according to her husband, Charles Rogers, at home in Jackson, Mich., of a heart condition.\n\nAs I recounted in 2020, I first met Conway when I was working on my 1999 book about Xerox PARC, \u201cDealers of Lightning,\u201d for which she was a uniquely valuable source. In 2000, when she decided to come out as transgender, she allowed me to chronicle her life in a cover story for the Los Angeles Times Magazine titled \u201cThrough the Gender Labyrinth.\u201d\n\nThanks to your courage, your example, and all the people who followed in your footsteps, as a society we are now in a better place.\n\nIBM apologizes for firing Lynn Conway for her gender transition in 1968\n\nThat article traced her journey from childhood as a male in New York\u2019s strait-laced Westchester County to her decision to transition. Years of emotional and psychological turmoil followed, even as he excelled in academic studies.\n\nHe won admission to MIT, but flunked out due to a lack of social or medical support. What would have been Conway's MIT graduation day found Conway in San Francisco, living on the fringes of the gay community, searching for how to fit in as a male. But he did not see himself as a gay man attracted to other men, but as a woman attracted to other men.\n\nIn 1961 he enrolled at Columbia University, acquiring bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering in only two years. That led to a position on a team at IBM secretly designing the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, a pet project of IBM President Thomas Watson Jr. Conway moved with the team to Menlo Park, Calif., in the years before the surrounding landscape was dubbed Silicon Valley.\n\nBy then Conway had gotten married and was raising two daughters. But family life intensified his inner turmoil, and in 1968 he decided to undertake gender reassignment surgery. Conway at PARC in the 1970s, in front of her Alto, the lab's innovative personal computer. (Lynn Conway)\n\nAs I wrote in 2000, Conway had visualized a nearly seamless transition. IBM was supportive, at least at first. It was willing to change the name on company records and execute a transfer to another lab, giving the employee henceforth known as Lynn Conway a fresh start.\n\nBut even as the $4,000 operation was still in the planning stage, it became clear that IBM executives could not understand how a transgender employee could fit into a corporate culture that was \"still white shirt, blue serge suits and wingtip shoes,\" as Conway's IBM supervisor told me. \"This simply wasn't the IBM image.\" The company fired him.\n\nDecades later, Conway was philosophical and nonjudgmental about IBM's decision. Gender transition and sex reassignment surgery were alien concepts at the time.\n\n\u201cChristine Jorgensen was the last time anything had come out about stuff like this,\u201d Conway told me in 2020. Jorgensen\u2019s transition, which had made front-page news in 1951, had been reduced to a historical curiosity nearly two decades later. T.J. Watson Jr., the president of IBM, \u201cwas thinking there would be endless publicity, and I can understand that.\u201d\n\nRead more:Column: IBM apologizes for firing a transgender pioneer, 52 years late\n\nThe family went on welfare for three months. Conway\u2019s wife barred her from contact with her daughters. She would not see them again for 14 years.\n\nBeyond the financial implications, the stigma of banishment from one of the world\u2019s most respected corporations felt like an excommunication.\n\nShe sought jobs in the burgeoning electrical engineering community around Stanford, working her way up through start-ups, and in 1973 she was invited to join Xerox's brand new Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC.\n\nIn partnership with Caltech engineering professor Carver Mead, Conway established the design rules for the new technology of \u201cvery large-scale integrated circuits\u201d (or, in computer shorthand, VLSI). The pair laid down the rules in a 1979 textbook that a generation of computer and engineering students knew as \u201cMead-Conway.\u201d\n\nVLSI fostered a revolution in computer microprocessor design that included the Pentium chip, which would power millions of PCs. Conway spread the VLSI gospel by creating a system in which students taking courses at MIT and other technical institutions could get their sample designs rendered in silicon.\n\nConway's life journey gave her a unique perspective on the internal dynamics of Xerox's unique lab, which would invent the personal computer, the laser printer, Ethernet, and other innovations that have become fully integrated into our daily lives. She could see it from the vantage point of an insider, thanks to her experience working on IBM's supercomputer, and an outsider, thanks to her personal history.\n\nAfter PARC, she was recruited to head a supercomputer program at the Defense Department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA \u2014 sailing through her FBI background check so easily that she became convinced that the Pentagon must have already encountered transgender people in its workforce. A figure of undisputed authority in some of the most abstruse corners of computing, Conway was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1989.\n\nShe joined the University of Michigan as a professor and associate dean in the College of Engineering. In 2002 she married a fellow engineer, Charles Rogers, and with him lived active life \u2014 with a shared passion for white-water canoeing, motocross racing and other adventures \u2014 on a 24-acre homestead not far from Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nRead more:Robert W. Taylor, visionary figure in personal computing, Internet, dies at 85\n\nIn 2020, she received an unexpected gift: A formal apology from IBM for firing her 52 years earlier. At an emotional ceremony witnessed by 1,200 IBM employees signed on to a company website, Diane Gherson, an IBM senior vice president, told her, \u201cThanks to your courage, your example, and all the people who followed in your footsteps, as a society we are now in a better place.... But that doesn\u2019t help you, Lynn, probably our very first employee to come out. And for that, we deeply regret what you went through \u2014 and know I speak for all of us.\u201d\n\nAt Michigan, she is remembered for her \"positive outlook, warm encouragement, creativity and 'singular vision,'\" the university observed in a retrospective posted Tuesday. \"Conway described herself in 2014 as a perennial beginner, never afraid to take on learning how to do new things.\"\n\nHer role as a leader in the transgender community may be even more important than her role in the extraordinary advances of the technology revolution of the late 20th century. She fought not a few battles over anti-transgender discrimination and what she called \"the systemic psychological pathologization of gender variance.\"\n\nOn her personal website she reflected with well-deserved pride of having used the website to offer \"gender transitioners ... information, encouragement and hope for a better future.\" When she began to do so in 2000, she recalled, \"trans women especially were considered sexually-deviant and mentally-ill by prejudiced psychiatrists and psychologists. By compiling stories of those who went on to fulfilling lives after transition,\" she wrote, she tried to provide \"role models and hope for the many people then in transition.\"\n\nShe added , \"Fortunately, those dark days have receded. Nowadays many tens of thousands of transitioners have not only moved on into happy and fulfilling lives, but are also open and proud about their life accomplishments.\"\n\nIt's a reproach to our society and our politics that Lynn's confidence that the \"dark days\" of transgender discrimination and prejudice were past has proven to be premature. I hope that she didn't allow herself to be too discouraged by the cynicism and hypocrisy of the political leadership in some of our most benighted states, and that she never forgot the extraordinarily positive impact she had on all the communities, professional and personal, of which she was a member.\n\nLynn Conway faced more challenges in her life than most of us can contemplate. She should be remembered as someone who, to paraphrase William Faulkner, not only faced them, but prevailed over them. And in doing so she enriched us all.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "IBM (IBM) ended the recent trading session at $169.32, demonstrating a -0.62% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.27% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.31%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.88%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had gained 1.68% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.82% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 2.85% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of IBM in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 24, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.17, marking a 0.46% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $15.58 billion, up 0.67% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIBM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.91 per share and revenue of $63.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +3.01% and +1.91%, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for IBM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.11% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, IBM possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, IBM is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.19. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.64 for its industry.\n\nOne should further note that IBM currently holds a PEG ratio of 4.2. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Integrated Systems industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.48 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 78, placing it within the top 31% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Truck Past Any Market Jitters",
        "content": "While the soaring equity indices suggest a resounding economic recovery, those living in the real world face a different paradigm. With myriad headwinds such as elevated inflation and high borrowing costs imposing significant pain on consumers, investors may feel more comfortable considering blue-chip stocks.\n\nLike any team sports competition, the investment game features an ebb and flow. A successful market participant responds to these shifts by making prudent decisions with their holdings. One of the wisest ideas an investor can make is to consider blue-chip stocks; that is, enterprises that are well-recognized and feature robust and predictable businesses.\n\nThey\u2019re not the most exciting ideas, that\u2019s for sure. Instead, think of these corporate giants as a massive pickup truck. Unlike a more fragile sports car, you\u2019re not going to be swerving to avoid every little pothole. Instead, you\u2019re just going to run right over these nuisances.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s the privilege behind blue-chip stocks. And with that, below are enticing ideas to consider.\n\nChurch & Dwight (CHD) boxes of Arm & Hammer baking soda\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top names in the consumer defensive sector, Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) ranks among the best blue-chip stocks for its underlying utility. Offering a wide range of household and personal products, Church & Dwight \u2013 which is best known for its Arm & Hammer brand \u2013 benefits from a permanently relevant narrative. No matter what\u2019s going on with the economy, people will need the essentials like oral care products.\n\nThanks to its predictable business, CHD is relatively easy to trust. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share reached roughly 82 cents. When stacked against analysts\u2019 expectations, Church & Dwight saw an average earnings surprise of 8.5%. That\u2019s not bad at all.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), the company posted net income of $780.1 million or EPS of $3.16. Revenue during this time hit $5.94 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate EPS to rise 9.15% year-over-year to hit $3.46. On the top line, the household goods giant could ring up $6.13 billion in sales, up 4.5% YOY.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA company that really needs no introduction, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) specializes in the home-improvement retailer business. What makes the company so intriguing is that stuff goes wrong all the time. Call it Murphy\u2019s law or some other phenomenon of misfortune. When it rains, it pours. And no, these things occur whether the market is in a bull or bear cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, Home Depot isn\u2019t the most exciting idea out there. However, because stuff happens all the time, the retailer serves the public in its moment of need. As a result, it enjoys consistency. During the past four quarters, its average EPS came in around $3.73. This performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 2.15%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Home Depot posted net income of $14.87 billion or earnings of $14.91 per share. Revenue reached $151.83 billion. For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for modest growth of 1.2% in EPS to hit $15.29. On the top line, sales may land at $153.96 billion, up around 1%. Again, while not exciting, HD is one of the blue-chip stocks that should keep your portfolio pointed in the right direction.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother massive retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) falls under the big-box variety. Featuring a one-stop-shop solution, one of the company\u2019s top benefits as it relates to blue-chip stocks to buy is the underlying everyday low pricing. By focusing on volume, Walmart has taken a massive share of the consumer market (both discretionary and essential).\n\nWhile WMT may be a predictable idea for blue-chip stocks, it\u2019s one of the ideas that you can depend on. During the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average EPS reached 54.5 cents. Against analysts\u2019 expectations, the performance translated to an earnings surprise of 8.28%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the big-box retailer posted net income of $18.94 billion or earnings of $2.33 per share. Revenue during this cycle hit $657.33 billion. Its latest quarterly revenue growth rate (YOY) comes in at 6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts seeking EPS of $2.43, up almost 20% YOY. Revenue may reach $676.64 billion, a 13.7% increase from the prior year\u2019s tally of $594.85 billion.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the iconic corporate giants of the U.S., McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) represents one of the top-tier blue-chip stocks to buy. Over the years, the Golden Arches has faced challenges, from rising competitors in the fast-casual space to concerns regarding the nutritional value of its offerings. However, the company benefits from massive brand power and awareness. It\u2019s also demonstrating a knack for reinventing itself to account for shifting consumer behaviors.\n\nDuring the past four quarters, McDonald\u2019s posted an average EPS of almost $2.96. In all fairness, it missed analysts\u2019 projections for Q1 2024 of earnings of $2.72 per share by two pennies. However, even with the miss, the company\u2019s average earnings surprise during the aforementioned period landed at just under 6%. That demonstrates the enterprise\u2019s consistency.\n\nIn the TTM period, the Golden Arches posted net income of $8.6 billion or EPS of $11.76. Revenue reached $25.76 billion, with its latest quarterly revenue growth rate hitting 4.6%. For fiscal 2024, EPS may rise 9.3% to reach $12.19. On the top line, sales could come in at $26.62 billion, up a stout 11.8% from the prior year.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial services giant Visa (NYSE:V) \u2013 which specializes in card payment solutions \u2013 presents a tricky case for blue-chip stocks to buy. It certainly represents one of the top-tier corporate institutions. However, questions exist about the viability of the sector. In particular, consumers (especially younger ones) are turning to credit cards to make ends meet.\n\nCombined with rising delinquencies, this dynamic presents challenges. However, if you wanted to look at the situation as a glass half-full, you could say that piling on the debt reflects broader confidence in the American system. Plus, the labor market has generally been robust, perhaps indicating that the nation could work through its troubles.\n\nSo far, the financials appear compelling. During the past four quarters, average EPS landed at $2.30. This performance translated to an earnings surprise of 2.93%. For fiscal 2024, experts are projecting EPS growth of 24.4% to reach $9.95. On the top line, sales could expand by almost 21% YOY to hit $35.94 billion.\n\nEven better, Visa\u2019s growth projections exceed that of rivals Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nOne of the more boring and uninspiring ideas for blue-chip stocks, legacy tech giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) nevertheless deserves some attention. To be sure, the company has been overshadowed by its younger counterparts. However, \u201cBig Blue\u201d is no slouch. It still offers tremendous acumen in artificial intelligence, deep learning, cybersecurity and even the blockchain. There may be underappreciated value here.\n\nFurther, after going through a volatile period in late April, it appears that IBM stock has stabilized. That could be good news particularly because of its passive income. Right now, the company offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.93%. As well, IBM posted an average EPS of $2.44 during the past four quarters. In terms of earnings surprise, this performance resulted in an average of 4.9%.\n\nNet income during the TTM period reached $8.15 billion or earnings of $8.82 per share. Revenue came in at $62.07 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS of $9.94. If so, that would imply 3.3% growth YOY. On the top line, IBM may ring up $63.03 billion, up 1.9% from last year.\n\nShell (SHEL) Shell logo on a gas station in Iceland. SHEL stock\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest hydrocarbon players, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) ranks among the supermajors. These integrated oil and gas stalwarts cover multiple segments of the energy value chain. To be sure, the hydrocarbon sector is a little bit tricky to decipher. With prices slipping, this dynamic implies that there is reduced global demand for fossil fuels.\n\nPart of the reason for the deflated view centers on Ukraine. Its defense forces have begun attacking invading Russia\u2019s oil refineries. In turn, the Russians must sell their crude oil at deep discounts to account for the loss of revenue for their refined products. That might not be great for SHEL stock. However, geopolitical dynamics can always shift unpredictably.\n\nOne area to consider is the Middle East. Tensions have cooled but this inflamed region could light up again. If so, global oil supplies may come under threat, which could be cynically positive for SHEL.\n\nNotably, analysts are looking for fiscal 2024 revenue to reach $346.79 billion, up 9.5% YOY. Further, the high-side target comes in at $443.5 billion, a massive gap up. Watch this space as SHEL could be one of the best blue-chip stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "CRM Outlook: Why Salesforce Stock Will Rebound Down the Road",
        "content": "A near-perfect storm of negative catalysts caused Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock to plunge after reporting its first-quarter results on May 30. The shares are likely to stay weak for some time due to the Street\u2019s current aversion to software names in general and Salesforce in particular.\n\nNonetheless, the company\u2019s valuation is quite undemanding at this point, its operating cash flow is rapidly increasing, and it should get a significant bump from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom over the longer term. What\u2019s more, the Street is likely to become much less hostile to software stocks in the medium term.\n\nIn light of these points, I view CRM stock as a hold for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA Near-Perfect Storm\n\nWith the Street already looking askance at software companies, Salesforce\u2019s slightly lower-than-expected Q1 results and Q2 guidance caused a huge decline of its shares. Specifically, the firm provided Q2 revenue guidance of $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion, versus analysts\u2019 previous mean outlook of $9.34 billion. Moreover, its Q1 sales came in at $9.13 billion, slightly below the mean outlook of $9.17 billion, while its current remaining performance obligations (CRPO) bookings rose 10%, significantly below the average estimate of 11.9%.\n\nThe misses came as the Street has soured on software stocks in general. As I noted in a Jun. 11 column, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (NYSEMKT:IGV) fell from $85.13 on May 20 to $80.43 on Jun. 7. I blamed the decline on weaker-than-expected quarterly results reported by a small number of software makers, including Salesforce, and large investors\u2019 current focus on the six largest tech names and a few other hardware makers benefiting tremendously from the AI boom.\n\nStill Growing Quickly and Generating Impressive Cash Flows\n\nObjectively, the company\u2019s business is growing relatively rapidly and is quite profitable. In Q1, its revenue jumped 11% versus the same period a year earlier and it maintained its full-year sales growth outlook of 8% to 9%. On the profitability front, the firm\u2019s operating cash flow soared 39% year-over-year in Q1 to a huge $6.25 billion and it continues to expect its operating cash flow to climb 21% to 24% for the full year.\n\nAt the midpoint of that range, its operating cash flow would come in at $12.5 billion. That means its shares are changing hands for a relatively low valuation of 18.67 times its expected forward operating cash flow.\n\nA Viable AI Strategy\n\nMeanwhile, the firm has launched a new software product called Data Cloud. By providing its customers with a way to compile their data into a single source, Salesforce is preparing them to be able to easily use the AI capabilities of Salesforce\u2019s Einstein 1 Platform to analyze that data. As a result, I believe that, after many of its customers adopt Data Cloud, Salesforce will be able to convince them to use Einstein 1 to analyze and draw conclusions from the information that they\u2019ve compiled into the application.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so far, the strategy appears to be working as it convinced over 1,000 enterprises to adopt Data Cloud for the second quarter in a row in Q1, while 25% of its deals that generate $1 million or more included a Data Cloud subscription.\n\nAlso importantly, Salesforce on May 21 disclosed that it had agreed to use IBM\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) large language models to enhance the AI capabilities of its Einstein 1 Platform. That should make Einstein 1 much more attractive to enterprises going forward.\n\nA Software rebound and the Bottom Line on Salesforce Stock\n\nSometimes the Street gets overly negative about certain sectors. For example, for the first several months of 2023 large investors soured tremendously on regional bank stocks. But most of the sector\u2019s names ultimately rebounded tremendously over the next year.\n\nSoftware stocks should go through a similar trajectory within the next 12 months, ultimately lifting Salesforce stock. However, the shares are likely to be weak for some time before such a rebound occurs. Therefore, I view Salesforce as a classic hold at this time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Adobe ADBE is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jun 13.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Adobe projects total revenues between $5.25 billion and $5.30 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.28 billion, suggesting growth of 9.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company expects non-GAAP earnings between $4.35 and $4.40 per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.39 per share, indicating a 12.3% rise from the year-ago period\u2019s actual. The earnings estimate has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming results are expected to reflect the benefits of growing generative AI capabilities on the back of its family of creative generative AI models, Firefly, which has been driving growth within the Digital Media and Digital Experience segments.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Media segment, comprising Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, is expected to have gained from the strong adoption of Firefly tools in Photoshop, Generative Fill and Generative Expand. The solid adoption of PDFs, coupled with strength in Frame.io, Adobe Stock, Acrobat ecosystem and Adobe Express Web, is anticipated to have been other positives.\r\n\r\nAdobe expects Digital Media revenues between $3.87 billion and $3.90 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.89 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.7%.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Experience segment, comprising Adobe Experience Cloud, is likely to have benefited from the solid demand for the Adobe Experience Platform.\r\n\r\nAdobe projects the Digital Experience segment\u2019s revenues between $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.32 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 8.1%.\n\nAdobe Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Adobe Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAdobe Inc. price-eps-surprise | Adobe Inc. Quote\n\nStrong Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nAdobe\u2019s near and long-term prospects are expected to gain from its strong efforts toward leveraging generative AI to deliver groundbreaking innovation across its portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe company has been aggressively integrating Firefly into its Creative Cloud flagship applications and Adobe Express to provide enhanced user experience.\r\n\r\nADBE\u2019s effort to integrate the power of Acrobat AI Assistant into PDF is boosting the adoption of the product in the near term.\r\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s unveiling of the Firefly Image 2 Model, Firefly Vector Model and Firefly Design Model to mark a significant advancement in its creative generative AI model family is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company recently launched Generative Remove in Adobe Lightroom, which is a powerful Firefly-backed tool that helps remove unwanted objects from any photo in a single click in a non-destructive manner.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Adobe Express for Enterprise, which is powered by Firefly Image Model 3, is helping the company gain traction across various enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Photoshop\u2019s web version, which is available via Firefly-powered AI tools, generative expand and generative fill, enables file collaboration through sharing links, even without subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also witnessing the strong adoption of Generative Fill in Photoshop, which allows the creation of images in new ways and acceleration of editing workflows. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Customer & Partner Bases Aid Growth\n\nA solid portfolio is helping ADBE in expanding its customer base.\r\n\r\nInternational Business Machines IBM is one of the notable customers leveraging Adobe Firefly. IBM was able to generate 200 campaign assets and more than 1,000 marketing variations in moments rather than months using Firefly models.\r\n\r\nAdobe\u2019s other key customer wins include the likes of AECOM, Capital Group, Dentsu, Nintendo, Berkshire Hathaway, Northrop Grumman, Porsche and the U.S. Navy. \r\n\r\nADBE\u2019s strategic partnerships with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL are also shaping its growth trajectory by driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nThe integration of Acrobat PDF technology into Microsoft Edge and Alphabet\u2019s Google Chrome is a major plus. Adobe is experiencing rising free-to-paid conversions on the back of its Acrobat extensions for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Adobe\u2019s recent partnership with Microsoft to provide marketing insights and workflows from Adobe Experience Cloud applications and Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Copilot in order to assist marketers in creative briefs development, content creation and content approval management, is noteworthy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdobe is well-poised to benefit from its strong generative AI-powered product offerings and cloud strategy. A strong market position in the PDF category, compelling product lines, continued innovation and a growing footprint in emerging markets should drive its business growth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ADBE is trading at a significant discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 24.04X compared with the industry\u2019s 31.85X, making it a good opportunity for investors.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Is DXC Technology (DXC) on the Acquisition Radar Again?",
        "content": "DXC Technology Company\u2019s DXC shares soared 11.5% on Monday as the IT services and solutions provider garnered attention as a potential acquisition target. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters on Monday revealed that Apollo Global Management and Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. KD are considering a joint bid for DXC.\n\nApollo Global Management is an asset management firm, while Kyndryl Holdings is an IT services provider that was created from the spin-off of International Business Machines Corporation\u2019s IBM infrastructure services business in 2021. International Business Machines owns a 19.9% stake in Kyndryl Holdings.\n\nThis is not the first time when DXC has attracted takeover interest. In October 2023, it was approached by a financial sponsor regarding the potential acquisition of the company. In early 2021, it received an unsolicited, preliminary and non-binding proposal to acquire all its shares from the French technology services provider Atos SE. However, both talks didn\u2019t materialize for different reasons.\n\nDXC's current valuation plays a crucial role in its appeal as an acquisition target. The company's stock has been trading at a one-year forward P/E multiple of 6.34X, significantly lower than the Zacks Computer - IT Services industry\u2019s 32.86X, making it a potentially lucrative investment for acquirers.\n\nThis attractive valuation multiple is a result of a 19.3% year-to-date (YTD) decline in DXC\u2019s share price. At the closing price of $18.45 as of Jun 10, the stock trades 36% lower than the 52-week high of $28.89.\n\nDXC Technology Company. Price and Consensus\n\nDXC Technology Company. price-consensus-chart | DXC Technology Company. Quote\n\nTransformation Efforts Attract Suitors\n\nWe believe that DXC\u2019s sustained efforts toward transforming itself from a struggling, highly leveraged company to a high-growth, business-oriented firm have made it a lucrative takeover target.\n\nDXC was formed by the merger of Computer Sciences Corporation (\u201cCSC\u201d) and the Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE, which was completed on Apr 1, 2017. CSC, prior to the completion of the merger, took an additional debt. This amplified DXC\u2019s total long-term liability, thereby increasing its interest cost burden while limiting its scope for investing in growth opportunities.\n\nTo overcome this situation, DXC resorted to debt refinancing and divestment, as well as a spin-off of non-core assets. The strategy significantly reduced its outstanding debt level to $3.82 billion as of Mar 31, 2024 from $10.33 billion as of Jun 30, 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nDivestment and spinning off non-core assets have improved DXC\u2019s focus on its core businesses. Also, it enhances the firm\u2019s ability to execute acquisition strategies across high-growth businesses, including enterprise software-as-a-service, technology security solutions and autonomous driving.\n\nThe trimmed business is likely to help DXC focus on reviving its financial performance, which has been hurt by a slowdown in IT spending. Additionally, a low-leverage balance sheet will provide it with financial flexibility in investing in growth areas.\n\nWhat Should Investors Do Now?\n\nWhile the prospect of an acquisition might create a buzz around DXC Technology, it is essential for investors to look beyond the headlines and consider the underlying fundamentals of the company. DXC\u2019s declining financial performance, high debt levels, competitive pressures and limited growth prospects all paint a challenging picture.\n\nDuring its recently reported financial results, the company provided dismal revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. It hinted that cautious spending by clients in a challenging macroeconomic environment would hurt its fiscal 2025 top-line performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.14 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 8.8%. The consensus mark for earnings has been revised 25% downward to 60 cents per share over the past 30 days, which calls for a 4.8% decline from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe potential for an acquisition does not necessarily translate into guaranteed gains for current shareholders, and the associated speculation can often lead to increased volatility and risk. Also, like previous takeover talks, if the acquisition does not materialize, the stock could suffer a significant decline.\n\nConsidering the ongoing challenges faced by DXC, along with a risk of speculated bid failure, it is wise to wait to invest in the stock until we see some clarity on its growth prospects.

        "content": "As investors triple down on the hottest AI stocks this June, more value-oriented investors should look to some of the neglected cloud companies, many of which have AI upside of their own.\n\nOf course, many investors seem to be getting incredibly impatient when it comes to cloud software firms, even as they consistently pull the curtain on new AI features, innovations, functionality, and copilots.\n\nWhile innovations are coming in fast, there\u2019s uncertainty about when massive gains will come. When will the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) effect kick in, if at all? Indeed, Nvidia\u2019s massive growth numbers probably will not be topped by any AI-leveraging software company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough AI\u2019s boost could accelerate, it\u2019s important to maintain realistic expectations and not just compare anything AI-related to the likes of Nvidia.\n\nThe good news is that some ultra-cheap cloud stocks already have far less in the way of expectations, with some notable cloud heavyweights forecasting softer outlooks, while pointing out that AI may be more of a longer-term driver.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an enterprise firm that\u2019s as innovative as it\u2019s ever been, with CEO Satya Nadella at the helm, a man who helped steer MSFT stock to exceptional results during the transition to the cloud. The largest company on Earth is also off to a running head-start in the AI race.\n\nWith Azure and AI combined, Microsoft remains a force to be reckoned with in the public cloud, with a realistic shot of overtaking Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS, perhaps in as little as two years.\n\nMicrosoft has been quite active in developing its own next-generation language models. From the edge-appropriate small language models, or SLMs, including Phi-3 Mini, with less than 4 billion parameters, to massive 500-billion-parameter large language models like MAI-1, it seems like Microsoft may not depend so heavily on OpenAI and ChatGPT as previously thought.\n\nIn due time, Microsoft may wind up being the LLM we all use for specific use cases. Either way, MSFT stock is the cloud and an AI stock that you just have to own at 37.11 times trailing price-to-earnings.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the cloud kings that investors should have at the top of their watchlists, right next to the Magnificent Seven companies.\n\nNow, ORCL stock is up more than 8% in the past year, thanks in part to some stellar AI-powered quarters. Specifically, cloud revenue soared 25% to $5.1 billion in the latest fiscal 2024 third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business gains traction, and demand for Gen2 Cloud infrastructure stays hot, Oracle stands out as a cloud and AI company that\u2019s still going for way too cheap, even with ORCL stock just shy of its all-time high.\n\nCurrently, ORCL stock goes for just 32.85 times trailing P/E, making it a relative bargain compared to other cloud and AI juggernauts like Microsoft. With AI enhancements recently rolled into Oracle\u2019s Fusion Cloud Customer Experience platform, it will be interesting to see how future quarters stack up, as Oracle bolsters its position in the AI race.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a great investment idea for investors seeking the perfect mix of income, as it shares boast a near-4% dividend yield and has AI-driven growth. The stock recently corrected, now down 14% from its 52-week high following a quarter that saw revenues rise by a minuscule 1% year over year.\n\nLooking ahead, I\u2019d look for the company\u2019s AI platform to gain more traction with customers, as it narrows in on certain high-demand use cases.\n\nSpecifically, AI governance with watsonx.governance and cybersecurity via IBM X-Force Red Testing Services could put IBM on what it views as \u201cthe next frontier of AI innovation.\u201d\n\nLike most other firms improving their software services with advanced AI, it\u2019s going to take some time before the sales growth really starts to explode. As the firm moves forward with its hybrid AI strategy, while keeping an ear open to potential M&A opportunities in the AI scene, IBM stands out as a seriously compelling buy on recent weakness.\n\nIBM stock goes for 19.3 times trailing P/E, making it one of the best value ideas for investors seeking to bet big on AI\u2019s future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Microsoft.

        "title": "3 Software Stocks to Buy on Weakness Before They Break Out",
        "content": "In recent weeks, many if not most software stocks have fallen sharply. Providing evidence for that assertion, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (NYSEMKT:IGV) sank from $85.13 on May 20 to $80.43 on Jun. 7. In my view, the decline was mainly due to two factors.\n\nFirst, a handful of software makers, including customer relationship management giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and identity management player Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), reported financial results that disappointed the Street. And second, most large investors continue to pile their money into the six largest tech firms, plus a few other hardware makers seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom.\n\nThe Street, though, sometimes becomes overly pessimistic or overly optimistic about groups of stocks. For example, the selloffs of regional banks in the first half of 2023 was way overdone, and many names within that group have since bounced back tremendously. Similarly, the decline of many software stocks now is overdone with many rebounding over the longer term. For long-term investors, here are three software stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) fell about 10% between May 21 and May 30. However, encouragingly, the shares rebounded 9% afterward. The latter increase indicates large investors view ServiceNow as one of the better software stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s impressive partnerships leave it very well-positioned to benefit significantly from the AI boom. For example, the firm announced last month it was partnering with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on AI. Specifically, ServiceNow will utilize IBM\u2019s main AI offering, Watsonx, within its AI platform. ServiceNow will also incorporate two of IBM\u2019s large language models into its Now Assist generative AI software.\n\nSimilarly, ServiceNow will offer Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot through Now Assist. These partnerships should make the company\u2019s AI offerings more appealing to many other businesses.\n\nAlso encouragingly, last quarter large institutions either held or bought about 170 million shares of NOW stock while only selling 9.35 million shares. And Goldman Sachs recently identified ServiceNow as one of the AI-exposed names that the largest mutual funds were overweighting the most.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) provides software used by companies to manage their human resources and financial applications. WDAY stock tumbled from $263.66 on May 23 to $215.56 on Jun. 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main catalyst for the huge decline was a truly tiny reduction in the firm\u2019s 2024 subscription revenue guidance. Whereas Workday previously predicted its subscription sales would come in at $7.73 billion to $7.78 billion, it now predicts it will generate 2024 subscription sales of $7.7 billion to $7.725 billion. The very small decrease does not justify the huge reduction in WDAY stock, especially because the company still expects its subscription revenue to climb about 17% this year. Moreover, Workday raised the guidance for its adjusted operating margin to 25%, versus 24.5% previously.\n\nIn the wake of the company\u2019s guidance cut, Japanese bank Mizuho trimmed its price target on the shares to $280, well above the current levels of WDAY stock. What\u2019s more, the bank still believes the software maker is poised to grow over the long term.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE:BB) stock has tumbled from $3.47 on May 14 to $2.68 on Jun. 7. The shares rose because they participated in the meme-stock revival and tumbled when the rebound faltered.\n\nBut BlackBerry is well-positioned to benefit from the rapid growth of the robotaxi business, Apollo Go, of its China-based partner, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Specifically, as I noted in a previous column, \u201cthe firm reportedly intends to deploy 1,000 of its new robotaxis in one city \u2013Wuhan \u2014 alone.\u201d Also importantly, Apollo Go is likely to become profitable next year. It makes Baidu heavily incentivized to keep expanding the unit rapidly over the longer term.\n\nMoreover, in April, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) agreed to use Baidu\u2019s mapping data for its own self-driving offering in China. As a result, I would not be surprised if Tesla begins using BlackBerry\u2019s technology in China. That provides the company with another sizeable boost.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackBerry announced last month that it had nominated Lori O\u2019Neill to join its board, effective Jun. 25. O\u2019Neill was a board member of Sierra Wireless and Phil Brace was the latter company\u2019s CEO when it was acquired in 2022. Now both are about to be serving on BlackBerry\u2019s board together.\n\nThat situation provides more evidence to support my previously articulated thesis that all or part of BlackBerry will be acquired sooner or later.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in BB and his wife held a long position in NOW.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow 30, is an index comprised of 30 leading blue-chip stocks. Taken together, the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow index are meant to provide a snapshot of the health of the U.S. economy. While that might be true, it doesn\u2019t mean all the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are infallible or good investments.\n\nCurrently, a number of stocks in the Dow 30 are underperforming the broader market, with some in the red for the year. Several Dow components have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks after issuing first-quarter financial results that fell short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Some have been hit with other negative news. Here are three Dow stocks to sell in June before they dive.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is already on a downslope after the cloud computing giant missed its quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2006. CRM stock fell 20% immediately after the company issued its first-quarter print. The stock has recovered a bit from the initial selloff but remains down 11% since the end of May and has declined 7% year to date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe cloud software vendor reported Q1 EPS of $2.44, better than the $2.38 expected among analysts. However, revenue in the quarter totaled $9.13 billion versus $9.17 billion forecasted on Wall Street. It was the first sales miss in nearly 20 years. Leadership blamed the results on longer deal cycles and the implementation of a new go-to-market strategy that cut into its quarterly bookings.\n\nWorse, management said on an earnings call that they expect deal compression and slowing projects in the professional services business to weigh on Salesforce\u2019s financial performance for the remainder of this year. It\u2019s time to sell CRM stock.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPerhaps investors should follow the lead of activist investor Nelson Peltz and dump their holdings of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock. Peltz sold his entire stake in the House of Mouse weeks after losing a proxy battle against the entertainment company. According to multiple media reports, Peltz sold all 30 million shares he owned in DIS stock. The sale was made at an average price of $120, earning Peltz a profit of $1 billion on his position.\n\nDisney\u2019s stock hit a 52-week high of $123.74 in April of this year before tumbling after the company\u2019s latest financial results disappointed. The stock currently trades at $101.54 per share, having gained 10% in the last 12 months. However, lest investors get too excited, Disney\u2019s share price is down nearly 30% over the past five years. Recent earnings showed trouble spots, notably with theatrical films and streaming content.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeltz\u2019s sale comes weeks after he lost a proxy battle at Disney as shareholders re-elected the company\u2019s existing board of directors. Peltz had taken issue with Disney\u2019s streaming strategy and succession plan for CEO Bob Iger, the same issues that analysts continue to highlight about the company. This all makes Disney a Dow stock to sell.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nShares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) don\u2019t look very enticing after the tech giant reported disappointing Q1 financial results and announced a curious new acquisition. The company reported EPS of $1.68, which topped the $1.60 forecasted among analysts. However, revenue of $14.46 billion missed forecasts of $14.55 billion. It was IBM\u2019s third revenue miss in the last five quarters, sending the stock down 8%.\n\nAlso weighing down IBM stock is news that the company is acquiring cloud software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) in a cash deal valued at $6.40 billion. Executives at IBM have said the acquisition will be accretive to earnings in the first full year after it closes. The company expects the deal to be finalized by year\u2019s end. HashiCorp is expected to complement Red Hat, which has contributed to IBM\u2019s revenue growth since that $34 billion purchase was completed in 2019.\n\nWhile management has put a positive spin on the HashiCorp deal, analysts and investors are viewing it as a head-scratcher, further contributing to the selloff in IBM stock. The company\u2019s shares are up 4% on the year compared to a 13% gain in the S&P 500 index.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Empowering Women and Girls in Asia-Pacific: IBM's Commitment to Education",
        "content": "By Justina Nixon-Saintil | VP and Chief Impact Officer\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 10, 2024 / In a world where technology is rapidly shaping the future, access to education and training programs is crucial to expanding opportunity. Recent research by UNESCO found that women make up only 35% of STEM graduates, and this number has not changed in the past 10 years. At the same time, women are more concerned about being replaced by AI than their male colleagues, according to an IBM IBV study.\n\nThis is why, in support of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Upskilling Initiative, in 2022 IBM pledged to train 1 million women and girls in the Asia-Pacific region over five years. As announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce today in Singapore, I'm pleased to share that our progress towards this commitment has been remarkable. Nearly 650,000 women and girls have already been empowered through IBM's efforts to promote education, skill development, and career opportunities for women across the region.\n\nFostering partnerships for impact\n\nAt IBM, we know that partnerships are key to making a real difference in people's lives, and we take a holistic approach focused on providing education and training for everyone. From India to Japan, to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, among others, we're collaborating with organizations across the region to increase access to technology education via IBM SkillsBuild.\n\nTo cite just a few examples:\n\nIn Japan, we're collaborating with ReBit and empowering LGBTQ+ individuals facing employment bias through skill-building. We're offering AI and cybersecurity education via our partnerships with Malaysia's Penang State Education Department and Indonesia's Ministry of Education. In the Philippines, we're working with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority to provide cybersecurity training for trainers and trainees. In India, we continue strengthening partnerships with organizations such as the Haryana State Board of Technical Education and various foundations and government bodies.\n\nStories of impact through IBM SkillsBuild\n\nWhat inspires me most are the stories of individuals who have faced challenges and benefited from our work. People like Ashley Pojol from the Philippines, whose completion of the IBM SkillsBuild cybersecurity credential honed her problem-solving and critical thinking skills and piqued her interest in a career in cybersecurity.\n\nIn India, there's Shilpi Pachauri, whose journey from a technology-disconnected village to a successful web developer in Indore exemplifies the impact of IBM SkillsBuild in bridging the digital divide and empowering women from economically disadvantaged communities. Also in the country, Heena Aggarwal's story is one that shows resilience as she has worked to overcome financial constraints in pursuit of her dream of becoming an education entrepreneur with the help of IBM SkillsBuild.\n\nStory continues\n\nAshley, Shilpi, and Heena remind me why our work is so vital and illustrate the impact we can have when we build strategic partnerships and invest in education.\n\nEmpowering the next generation for global advancement\n\nWe're at a pivotal moment for inspiring and equipping the next generation around the world with the resources they need for careers in technology, which can offer a unique opportunity for social and economic advancement. IBM's pledge to empower women in the Asia-Pacific region is aligned with our commitment to create equitable impact through the expansion of opportunities for everyone. This pledge is also part of IBM's global commitment to skill 30 million people by 2030, with over 11.5 million trained learners so far.\n\nAs the journey continues, one thing remains clear: when women are given the opportunity to thrive, entire societies prosper.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks this summer is a smart choice for any investor who wants to grow their portfolio. By buying stocks that represent established, financially sound companies, blue-chip stocks offer stability that investors can count on to anchor their holdings.\n\nSo far in 2024, the S&P 500 is up 12% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 14%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes many blue-chip stocks, has only increased by 3%. So, choosing which blue-chip stocks to buy is of paramount importance. In today\u2019s market, I would favor blue-chip stocks that have a technology background.\n\nGiven the current market conditions, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posting significant gains, there are advantages to including the best blue-chip stocks into your portfolio. We\u2019ll use the Portfolio Grader to identify the best blue-chip stocks to buy, based on earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBy choosing blue-chip stocks with a proven track record, stability, and potential for long-term growth, you will set yourself up to have a profitable summer investing season.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best blue-chip stocks you can buy. They don\u2019t get any bigger than Microsoft \u2014 the company has a market capitalization of more than $3.1 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nAnd you can make the argument that they don\u2019t come any better than Microsoft, either. The company\u2019s Microsoft Office 365 suite of products is used by businesses and individuals around the world and includes some of the most popular software on the planet, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.\n\nThe company\u2019s Microsoft Teams platform allows co-workers to share files on Microsoft\u2019s cloud, collaborate and have both one-on-one and group meetings \u2014 an essential component for doing business in a hybrid work environment.\n\nMicrosoft also has an important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of the generative artificial intelligence product ChatGPT, and was an early adopter in incorporating generative AI into its products.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 included $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year ago. Net income of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.94 was a 20% increase from last year.\n\nMicrosoft is continuing to show a growth mindset that bodes well for today\u2019s investor. The stock is up 14% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ;GOOG;NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an outstanding name in itself. It has tremendous advertising power through its Google search engine, which maintains about 90% of global search traffic.\n\nThat makes the Google platform one of the most important places for advertisers to target with their messaging.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a huge money-maker for Alphabet. Revenue in the first quarter of the year just from Google search was $46.1 billion, up from $40.3 billion a year ago. Alphabet also got another $8 billion in revenue from YouTube ads and $7.4 billion from its Google Network.\n\nAll in all, Google services and advertising accounted for $70.3 billion of the company\u2019s $80.5 billion in revenue for the quarter.\n\nAnd true to the nature of a blue-chip stock, Alphabet also is starting to pay a quarterly dividend, with 20 cents per share payable to shareholders of record on June 10. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first dividend, but management indicates that it intends to at least maintain the quarterly payout in the future.\n\nGOOG stock is up 32% since March and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere must be something in the water these days, because Alphabet isn\u2019t the only blue-chip tech company that is starting to pay a dividend. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced in February that it would begin paying a dividend, and the first payment of 50 cents per share went out on Feb. 21.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that tech companies are making dividend payments because they have been solely focused on growth \u2014 increasing market share, position and pumping revenues into new products to grow the business.\n\nBut a quarterly dividend payout indicates that the company sees value in its shareholders as well, and is one of the hallmarks of a true blue-chip company.\n\nMeta Platforms has plenty of money to keep the dividend going, as well. The owner of the Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms saw revenue in the first quarter of $36.4 billion, up 27% from a year ago.\n\nNet income was $12.3 billion, an increase of 117% from last year, and EPS was $4.71, up from $2.20 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMETA stock is up 39% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou have to consider International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) a blue-chip stock when you consider its history.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most well-known names in computing, tracing its history back for generations and punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s.\n\nIBM was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t get to be a top-rated blue-chip stock just for its history. Today\u2019s IBM remains relevant by being one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers on the planet. It offers its Watson AI engine and the Watsonx generative AI platform to enterprise customers.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings saw $14.5 billion in revenue, which was up 1% from a year ago. Net income was $1.6 billion, however, up 69% increase from last year. EPS of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM expects full-year revenue growth in 2024 in the mid- single digits, and expects to generate roughly $12 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nThe stock is up 3% so far this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) doesn\u2019t have the long history of IBM boasts. But for a streaming service, Netflix is one of the oldest and best \u2014 and it\u2019s still performing well.\n\nNetflix dates its history to the days of video rental stores. It emerged as a disruptive force by allowing customers to rent movies by mail \u2014 and they could keep them as long as they wanted.\n\nWhen they wanted to watch something different, all they had to do was send the movie back in the pre-paid envelope and choose something else.\n\nThe convenient business model utterly destroyed the video rental store business, but Netflix continued to evolve into a streaming service that offered movies and reruns of TV programming, as well as original content.\n\nEven after other streaming services emerged as competition, Netflix remains the gold standard. Netflix reported 269.6 million paid memberships in the first quarter, up 16% from a year ago.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $9.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion a year ago. Net income was $2.3 billion and $5.2 per share versus $1.3 billion and $2.88 per share in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nNFLX stock is up 33% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) isn\u2019t a technology company, although it uses tech to its advantage to operate its warehouses, manage supplies and interact with customers. It also has a growing e-commerce presence that is heavily reliant on technology.\n\nBut what makes Walmart a blue-chip stock is its position as a brick-and-mortar retailer. It\u2019s the biggest retailer in the world, with more than 10,800 locations that includes every U.S. state and two dozen countries.\n\nWalmart\u2019s low-cost strategy is ideal as customers are looking to stretch their dollars in an inflationary environment. Walmart artificially keeps the prices of its own brands low to force name-brand suppliers to lower their prices as well. And because Walmart has so many stores, it has unmatched negotiating power in pressuring name brands.\n\nRevenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2025 was $161.5 billion, up 6% from the previous year. That include e-commerce says that were up an impressive 21%.\n\nWalmart also issued revised full-year guidance that indicates the company should come in at the high end or slightly exceed its prediction that net sales would increase 3% to 4% for the year. The company also says it may exceed its EPS prediction of a range between $2.23 to $2.37 for the year.\n\nWMT stock is up 27% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a top biotech company that offers a range of drugs and treatments. But it\u2019s getting the most attention for its entry into the popular field of weight loss drugs.\n\nAbout 42% of the U.S. population is obese, and there are hundreds of diet programs, weight-loss schemes and products on the market for people who want to drop some pounds. But it wasn\u2019t until November 2023 that the Food and Drug Administration finally approved Lilly\u2019s drug, Zepbound, as a treatment specifically to help people lose weight.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 people who took the injectable drug at its highest dose (15 mg) report losing more than 58 pounds over a 72-week period.\n\nThe drug in Zepbound, tirzepatide, is also used in another highly successful Lilly product called Mounjaro, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe drugs are so popular that Lilly is increasing its investment in its Indiana manufacturing facility from $3.7 billion to $9 billion to increase the production of tirzepatide and other pipeline products.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $8.76 billion, up 26% from a year ago thanks to Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and Jardiance. Income of $2.2 billion was up 67% from last year, and EPS of $2.48 was an improvement from $1.49 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nLLY stock is up 43% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in MSFT and LLY.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Singapore\u2019s commercial real estate market has been a standout amid a global downturn, with one major exception.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE S&P 500 Hits 25th Record This Year as Tech Soars: Markets Wrap SEC Hedge Fund Fee Disclosure Rule Struck Down by US Court Modi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority Goldman Sees \u2018Wall of Money\u2019 Fueling Stock Market\u2019s Summer Party\n\nJust nine miles from the gleaming skyscrapers that crowd the country\u2019s Central Business District sits a 71-hectare (175-acre), billion-dollar example of the city-state\u2019s push to create alternative business hubs. Changi Business Park, dubbed the \u201cCBD of the East\u201d was a big draw for tech giants including International Business Machines Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Global banks from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Citigroup Inc. have also situated their back-end staff there.\n\nThe business park is now rapidly emptying out, dealing a blow to the Singapore government\u2019s meticulous urban planning and efforts to get foreign businesses to expand their regional operations in the Southeast Asian island nation. Overall vacancy rates across 10 commercial properties there tracked by property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield have more than doubled in the past three years to nearly 40%.\n\nThe development\u2019s woes show how global tech and finance layoffs, together with the push to work from home since the pandemic, are even overpowering a project with powerful government support in one of the world\u2019s most desirable financial hubs. Changi\u2019s struggles contrast with Singapore\u2019s packed downtown, where prime office rents soared to a 15-year high earlier this year and buildings are almost full.\n\nIBM, which occupied two namesake buildings with a total of 12 floors at Changi, has reduced its presence to two floors, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. UBS Group AG has cut the more than 110,000 square feet (10,220 square meters) of space it occupied by more than half. Standard Chartered Plc, which owns two buildings in the park, has been seeking to lease out two floors with at least 58,000 square feet of office space, according to a property listing.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Changi, several buildings had \u201cFor Rent\u201d signs plastered outside their modern glass facades, including the space IBM formerly occupied, which is owned by government agency JTC Corp. Hansapoint, a seven-story development with landscaped gardens and a gym, was only 36.5% occupied at the end of 2023 following UBS\u2019s downsizing. It was close to full previously. The Swiss bank declined to comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nHansapoint is owned by CapitaLand Ascendas REIT, one of Singapore\u2019s largest commercial landlords. The overall occupancy of the real estate investment trust's more than 2.3 million square feet of lettable space in the park has dropped to about 76% at end-2023, from nearly 94% four years earlier. Some of its under-performing business park units in Changi and elsewhere are being offered at a \"3-for-2\" rate - meaning that tenants can get one year's rent free if they sign a new three-year lease, according to people familiar with the matter and a promotional campaign online.\n\nA spokesperson for the REIT said it is in discussions with prospects for Changi Business Park, and that it employs a wide range of incentives to engage with potential clients and existing tenants. The firm\u2019s overall business space and life sciences portfolio occupancy exceeds the industrial average in the country, the spokesperson said.\n\nSingapore remains a critical global hub for Standard Chartered, where over 80% of its staff here have adopted flexible work arrangements, a spokesman for the British lender said. The bank retains a significant presence at Changi Business Park and the downtown Marina Bay Financial Centre, he said. IBM, which also retains three floors at MBFC, said it remains committed to its local operations, and its \u201coptimization\u201d of space at Changi in recent years has been shaped in part by its hybrid working model and the spinoff of its managed infrastructure services business.\n\n\u2018Changalore\u2019\n\nWhile the challenges faced by Singapore\u2019s business park landlords mirror those in other parts of the world, there are also some uniquely local issues that make marketing the properties an uphill effort.\n\nConceptualized in the early 1990s, Changi Business Park is part of a decades-long decentralization drive by authorities, which include plans to develop a new CBD in the island\u2019s west. The park is situated between Changi Airport \u2014 one of the world\u2019s busiest aerodromes \u2014 and the country\u2019s largest exhibition venue.\n\nBut for Singapore white-collar workers who prefer being in the central district, the business park is still a prohibitively far-out location. A bank employee who asked not to be named said she spends at least 90 minutes commuting each way via public transport, which costs around $2. A taxi or a ride-hailing service would take less than half the time, but can cost as much as $45 during peak hours, she added.\n\nTo make the commute easier, companies like Standard Chartered have arranged for shuttle buses to ferry staffers from their downtown locations or subway stations to Changi. Singapore is building a new underground subway line to slash traveling times from one end of the island to the other, but it is years away from completion.\n\nChangi Business Park has also become a lightning rod for citizens\u2019 anxieties about the city-state\u2019s wooing of foreign labor to meet business needs. The predominance of technical operations there has led to what a minister once said was a \u201cconcentration\u201d of Indian expatriate workers, with some locals calling the area \u201cChennai Business Park\u201d or \u201cChangalore.\n\nSingapore authorities have tightened immigration policies in recent years, such as by hiking minimum salary thresholds for work visa holders. That has pushed up hiring costs for businesses, making them consider basing their regional back-end staff in cheaper countries like neighboring Malaysia. Some banks are using the threat of moving there as a negotiating tactic to get landlords to cut their rents in business spaces, according to a person familiar with discussions on rental renewals.Elsewhere, new supply is set to further challenge the market. Punggol Digital District, a 50-hectare business park developed by JTC in Singapore's northeast, will start opening in stages from later this year. One person involved in marketing Changi\u2019s properties described the effect of the new space as killing an already dying patient.\n\nJTC said the Punggol project is an example of its efforts to keep business parks attractive. \u201cWhile there appears to be increasing vacancies in older estates, we do not see this as a reflection of inherent weakness in any specific sector,\u201d the agency said.\n\nSouring Investors\n\nOverall business park vacancies in Singapore rose to about 22% during the first quarter, the highest level in over a decade, according to government data compiled by property consultancy Colliers International Group Inc. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has given up about 60,000 square feet of space at Mapletree Business City, a business park on the fringes of the city center. A Google spokesperson said the firm is working to ensure its real estate investments match the current and future needs of its hybrid workforce.\n\nInvestor confidence has been hit. Since last year, another REIT, Mapletree Industrial Trust, has been seeking to divest three of its Singapore business park assets worth S$533 million ($396 million), including a nine-story building called The Signature in Changi, people familiar with the matter said. A spokesperson for the REIT, which is backed by state investor Temasek Holdings Pte, declined to comment.\n\nLocal developer Frasers Property Ltd. recently reached a deal to sell a serviced-apartment and hotel complex in the heart of the park, which Chief Executive Officer Panote Sirivadhanabhakdi attributed partly to the \u201cstructural challenge\u201d industrial and business parks are now facing.\n\nTo be sure, Changi recently recorded some success. Julius Baer Group Ltd. in April said it relocated close to 700 staff from Mapletree Business City to a larger space spanning over 75,000 square feet in the business park. The Swiss wealth-management firm also has an office in Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay area.\n\nFor the remaining vacant areas, the search for tenants continues. The once-occupied floors of the IBM building have fallen silent. One floor displays a dusty sign asking staff to move out by end-2022, while another still has cubicles and furniture, but no people.\n\n--With assistance from Krystal Chia and Chanyaporn Chanjaroen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) closed at $167.38 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.95% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 1.19% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.25%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.96%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 1.53% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.37% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.35% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of IBM in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on July 24, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.17, marking a 0.46% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $15.58 billion, reflecting a 0.67% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIBM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.91 per share and revenue of $63.04 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +3.01% and +1.91%, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for IBM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.11% downward. IBM currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, IBM is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 16.73. This signifies no noticeable deviation in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 16.73 for its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that IBM currently trades at a PEG ratio of 4.08. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. IBM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.43 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 76, positioning it in the top 31% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow IBM in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street's Top Income Stock Pick for June 2024\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAs the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in September, Wall Street analysts predict that 2024 will be the year of income stocks. According to Bank of America analysts, households tend to divest from money market funds and invest in dividend stocks when interest rates fall below 5%. With the current Fed fund rate at 5.5% and experts predicting at least three rate cuts this year, the best dividend stocks are trading at their lowest, offering an opportunity to buy at a discount.\n\nRecent ratings from Wall Street analysts imply an upside of nearly 20% for International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), one of the best-rated income stocks. The stock offers an impressive annual dividend yield of 4.04%, well above the industry average of 1.13%.\n\nIBM can comfortably sustain its dividends, given its free cash flow (FCF) payout ratio of 48%. A low FCF payout ratio indicates that the company has sufficient cash to pay its shareholders and reinvest for growth. IBM is a dividend aristocrat with a solid 35-year history of consistent and increasing dividends. The stock has paid dividend yields above 3% since 2015, with a reasonable annual dividend growth rate of 5.7%.\n\nThe company\u2019s balance sheet is strong enough to support growth and dividend payments. IBM\u2019s strong business model and investment in AI have a high potential for boosting its growth.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "As the potential of blockchain becomes increasingly apparent across various industries, investors are keen to identify undervalued blockchain stocks that have the potential to deliver substantial returns in the coming years. This has led to my list of blockchain stocks to buy for June this year.\n\nAs the blockchain industry continues to mature and gain mainstream adoption, identifying undervalued stocks with strong growth potential becomes more crucial for investors seeking to maximize their returns.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s great potential in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the potential for blockchain technology is immense. I believe that we\u2019ve only started to see the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the transformative power of blockchain. Beyond its applications in cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are my three best picks for investors who are interested in tapping into the blockchain industry. These names will not stay this cheap for long, so paying attention to these names today could pay off in spades later on.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), while not a pure-play blockchain company, it has been actively investing in and developing blockchain solutions for various industries, including supply chain management, financial services and healthcare. It\u2019s known for its hyperledger fabric blockchain solution, which is used by large enterprises.\r\n\r\nIBM reported mixed first-quarter results, with adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share beating expectations, but sales of $14.46 billion falling slightly short of analyst estimates. The company also announced plans to acquire cloud-software company HashiCorp for $6.4 billion, a move that complements IBM\u2019s focus on helping enterprise clients and could also synergize with its blockchain ambitions.\n\nIBM is definitely your father\u2019s tech stock, with it being a low beta, stable, dividend aristocrat. Although its dividend growth rate is lower than many others, it complements this with a stable nature and very manageable payout ratio.\n\nIBM would work in a blockchain investors\u2019 portfolio if they value stability above speculative growth.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) focuses on Bitcoin mining and has significantly expanded its mining operations.\n\nRIOT disclosed that it had approached Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) with a $950 million buyout offer, which was rejected. Riot Platforms, currently the largest shareholder of Bitfarms with a 9.25% stake, offered $2.30 per share to create \u201cthe world\u2019s largest publicly-listed bitfarm mining company.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRIOT and other blockchain companies are the antithesis of IBM\u2019s positioning in the blockchain industry. In order for RIOT to and others to stay afloat, they are making a large gamble on Bitcoin\u2019s future capital appreciation.\n\nDue to the ongoing reduced block rewards and increasing difficulty, it requires Bitcoin to progressively increase in price as time goes on, in order for these companies to turn a profit. It\u2019s a risky business model, but firms like RIOT could skyrocket in value in the future if their long-term thesis plays out as expected, with the mined coins on the balance sheet worth fortunes.\n\nRIOT has an impressive hash rate. It could become one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies on a book value basis if the Bitcoin dream comes alive.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) reported its second consecutive quarterly profit, with net income reaching $1.17 billion in the first quarter of 2024, the highest in nine quarters. Net revenue also rose by 115% compared to the same period last year, driven by a revival in digital coin trading, largely due to the launch of new bitcoin ETFs in January.\n\nThe halving event in April really put Bitcoin\u2019s volatility in overdrive, with the coin surging to a new all-time high not long after. Since then, the Federal Reserve\u2019s indecision to lower rates and geopolitical turmoils have put a cork on its usually parabolic nature.\n\nStill, it has oscillated around the $60,000 to $70,000 mark quickly over the past few weeks, which is ideal trading conditions.\n\nI believe that this year will be a historic one for COIN, as more volatility can naturally be assumed to lead to more trading fee revenue and other subscription products as traders are glued to their screens. If rates lower this year, I believe the conditions are set to see another all-time high being breached as the crypto bull market is firmly in full swing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "IBM Study: Banking and Financial Markets CEOs are betting on generative AI to stay competitive, yet workforce and culture challenges persist",
        "content": "Two-thirds (66%) of banking and financial markets CEOs surveyed said that the potential productivity gains from AI and automation are so great that they must accept the risks to stay competitive.  65% of financial institution leaders say that succeeding with AI will depend more on people's adoption than the technology itself and 60% recognize they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some might find comfortable.  Half (50%) of financial services CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI-related roles that did not exist last year and 53% indicate they are struggling to fill key technology positions.\n\nARMONK, N.Y., June 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- New findings from the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Institute for Business Value revealed that banking and financial markets (BFM) CEOs are facing workforce and culture and challenges as they act quickly to implement and scale generative AI across their organizations.\n\nThe findings are part of an annual global cross-industry study that surveyed more than 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries, which included 297 BFM CEOs representing retail, corporate, commercial and investment banks and financial markets.\n\nThe survey found that generative AI is perceived as the key to unlocking competitiveness. 57% of BFM CEOs surveyed stated that gaining a competitive advantage in the sector will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.\n\nThe findings also revealed that CEOs are navigating complex issues around culture in the era of AI. 59% of surveyed BFM CEOs stated that cultural change within a business is more important than overcoming technical challenges when becoming a data-driven business, with 65% also believing success with AI will depend more on people's adoption than the technology itself.\n\nDespite this, 60% of surveyed BFM CEOs say they are pushing for AI adoption more quickly than some employees might find comfortable. Yet 43% acknowledged that their employees do not fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.\n\nSkills also proved to be an area of focus for the CEOs. While 60% of surveyed BFM CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles. In addition, 50% of these CEOs said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist this time last year due to generative AI, showing the rapid shift occurring in the workforce.\n\n\"Our research reflects the tremendous pressure CEOs are under to keep their competitive edge. Alongside profitability and productivity, getting the right skills remains a persistent challenge, with CEOs now hiring for roles that did not exist until recently,\" said Shanker Ramamurthy, Global Managing Partner Banking & Financial Markets, IBM Consulting. \"Workforce needs are shifting rapidly in the financial services sector and CEOs must ensure that upskilling programs are prioritized as an important element of any financial institution's enterprise strategy for scaling generative AI.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, 66% of BFM CEOs surveyed stated that the potential productivity gains from automation are so great that they would accept significant risks to stay competitive, with 67% saying they would risk more than their competitor to maintain competitive edge.\n\nHowever, BFM CEOs recognized that trust cannot be sacrificed for innovation. 64% of surveyed BFM CEOs agreed that maintaining customer trust will have a greater impact on success than any specific product or service, and 83% acknowledged that transparency around adopting new technologies was critical for fostering trust among customers and employees.\n\n\"CEOs in the banking and financial markets sector are keenly aware of the competitive benefits that generative AI will bring and are eager to move quickly,\" said John Duigenan, Distinguished Engineer & General Manager, Global Financial Services Industry at IBM. \"In their enthusiasm to embrace the benefits of this potent new technology, it's critical that financial services leaders ensure their institutions are taking steps to engineer trustworthy AI designed to reduce risk and win the confidence of their customers, employees and regulators.\"\n\nKey Study Findings\n\nBFM CEOs are hedging their bets on generative AI to stay competitive and are willing to take risks to achieve this.\n\n57% of respondents believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI.  Two-thirds (66%) of those surveyed agreed that the potential productivity gains from automation are so great that they would accept significant risks to stay competitive and 67% said they would take more risk than their competitors to maintain a competitive advantage.  However, customer trust was not a sacrifice CEOs are willing to make. 64% surveyed agreed that maintaining customer trust will have a greater impact on success than any specific product, and 83% acknowledged transparency in adopting new technologies is critical for fostering trust among customers and employees.\n\nThe workforce is shifting rapidly.\n\n50% of CEOs surveyed said they are hiring for roles that did not even exist last year due to the rise of generative AI.  Yet, more than half (53%) of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles. 60% of respondents said their current team has the knowledge and skills to incorporate new technologies like AI.  Only 40% of respondents have assessed the potential impact of generative AI on their workforce.  Surveyed CEOs say 34% of their workforce will require retraining and reskilling over the next three years \u2013 up from just 7% in 2021.\n\nFinancial institution leaders recognize it takes a cultural shift to scale AI successfully but face collaboration and adoption challenges within their organizations.\n\n64% of CEOs surveyed say their organization's success is directly tied to the quality of collaboration between finance and technology, yet half (50%) say competition among their C-Suite executives sometimes impedes collaboration. 59% agree that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven business than overcoming technical challenges.  65% of BFM CEOs say that succeeding with AI will depend more on people's adoption than the technology itself. At the same time, 43% acknowledge that their employees do not fully understand how strategic decisions impact them. 60% of surveyed CEOs say they push for AI adoption more quickly than some might find comfortable.  64% of surveyed BFM CEOs say to win the future, they must rewrite their organizational playbook. 72% plan to maintain or accelerate their organization's pace of transformational change in 2024.\n\nProductivity is a top priority but focusing on short-term targets may hinder long-term progress.\n\nBFM CEOs ranked tech modernization as their highest priority for the next three years. Productivity, profitability, and scalability were identified as the biggest challenges facing BFM CEOs over the next three years, with 46% agreeing that generative AI will be one of the most useful tools in helping them overcome these challenges.  However, BFM CEOs identified the focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation.\n\nIBM is a leading provider of enterprise AI, hybrid cloud architecture, security and ESG insights to the global financial services sector.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite, which holds a number of big-name tech stocks, experienced a bit of selling pressure last week. In particular, the index fell nearly 2%. This potentially creates an opening for savvy investors to buy up shares of stocks that appear undervalued. One growth sector worth looking into would be quantum computing. Most people by now are familiar with generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. This led us to creating this list of undervalued quantum computing stocks.\n\nGenerative AI has already begun to change the way people work and consumer information. In a similar vein, quantum computing could very well usher in a similar era of technological innovation. This kind of computing technology relies on quantum mechanics \u2013 that is, properties of subatomic to particles \u2013 to calculate complex problems that classical computers have a hard time solving. Some of these problems include weather prediction and optimization problems. While quantum computing remains in its nascent phases, there are a number of public companies that have made significant contributions to field and are also trading at attractive valuations.\n\nBelow are three of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUndervalued Quantum Computing Stocks: International Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a legacy technology behemoth that started working on quantum computers in the early 2000s. The company has continued to innovate in the field since then. In 2019, IBM released the Q System One, which was a fully-integrated quantum computing system that the company had said was ready for both commercial and scientific use. Though the \u201ccommercial use\u201d of the quantum computing system may had been an overstatement, the Q System One definitely served as a stepping-stone for the entire sector.\n\nTowards the end of 2023, IBM unveiled the Q System Two, the firm\u2019s \u201cfirst modular quantum computer\u201d that operate with three IBM Heron processors. Each of these processors are innovations in their own right, relying on 133 qubits. Outside of the hardware realm of quantum computing, IBM has also contributed to the software side of the space. The software stack Qiskit Patterns will allow quantum developers to easily create code for quantum computing purposes, while \u201cwatsonx\u201d will leverage generative AI to facilitate the writing of quantum computer programs.\n\nIBM\u2019s stock trades at 16.9x forward earnings, making it cheaper than a lot of the tech giants out there. More achievements in the field of quantum computing could create opportunities for multiple expansion for investors who decide to buy in now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has received much scrutiny over the years. Once a crown-jewel of the American semiconductor industry, the chipmaker has fallen behind rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in both the CPU and GPU computing chip verticals. Intel does, however, appear to have an innovative edge in terms of quantum computing. At the beginning of May, Intel unveiled cutting-edge research that could lead to the \u201cscaling of silicon-based quantum processors,\u201d which would be a major step in developing \u201cfault-tolerant\u201d quantum computers. These computational systems would be able to perform calculations with very low error rates.\n\nIntel\u2019s Tunnel Falls chip is also an important achievement in the broader space. Released to the research community, Tunnel Falls and its advanced silicon features will help edge the chipmaker further to developing a viable and commercial quantum computer.\n\nIntel\u2019s share price trades at around 24.4x forward earnings, which makes it relatively cheaper to its chip competitors, Nvidia and AMD. As Intel ramps up its manufacturing capabilities, it will definitely be a stock to watch in terms of AI and quantum computing innovations. This is easily one of the most undervalued quantum computing stocks.\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) is an industrial conglomerate that operates in the aerospace and defense industry. The firm\u2019s \u201cAerospace\u201d division, for example, develops power units, propulsion engines, electric power systems as well as engine controls, flight safety and navigation hardware. What is lesser known is Honeywell\u2019s investments into the quantum computing space. As I have written in a previous article, Honeywell\u2019s serious entry into the quantum computing space came through the formation of Quantinuum , which had been a merger between Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum in 2021.\n\nHoneywell maintains majority ownership of Quantinuum and through this new business, Honeywell has been able to continue innovating in the space. Quantinuum\u2019s System Model H1 is the startup\u2019s first-generation quantum computing system. Leveraging Honeywell\u2019s proprietary technology and research, the quantum system features 20 qubits. Similar to other quantum computing systems, researchers can harness its power via a cloud environment like Azure Quantum.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s share price trades at 20.0x forward earnings. As quantum computing becomes commercially viable, there\u2019s not much doubt in my mind that Honeywell will be able to reap the benefits. If you are looking for undervalued quantum computing stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems. His areas of expertise are semiconductor and enterprise software equities.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 4, 2024 / At IBM, we believe in the power of driving positive impact in communities around the world. Each year, we are proud to recognize the outstanding contributions of IBMers worldwide who exemplify our commitment to volunteerism, through the IBM Volunteer Excellence Awards.\n\nThese awards honor individuals and groups with exceptional dedication to making a positive impact. Together, the winners volunteered across 12 countries in 2023, working on diverse projects. From organizing coding workshops for girls in underserved communities to leading food distribution efforts in low-income neighborhoods, their contributions have touched and inspired many.\n\nSome of the winners include:\n\nIn Italy, a team of IBMers collaborated with Differenza Donna, a nonprofit committed to supporting women who are survivors of gender-based violence. IBMers helped equip women in the program with essential digital skills through IBM SkillsBuild covering topics such as AI, design thinking, and cybersecurity, offering them a source of empowerment, job preparedness, and a fresh start for them and their children. In Miyakojima, an isolated island in Japan that heavily relies on external sources for its energy needs, a team of IBMers volunteered through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator. IBMers developed an energy forecasting model utilizing cloud and AI technologies, which seeks to enhance the island's self-sufficiency in clean, renewable energy. Learn more about the work in Miyakojima here.\n\nIn recognition of their extraordinary efforts, each award recipient will receive a $10,000 (USD) grant to support a nonprofit organization of their choice further. This grant is a testament to IBM's ongoing commitment to helping those who are driving positive change in their communities.\n\nWhile the Volunteer Excellence Awards highlight the achievements of a select group of individuals, IBM believes that every IBMer has the power to make a difference. Whether through volunteering at IBM offices, participating in community-based initiatives, or contributing virtually, there are countless ways for IBMers to get involved.\n\nIBM is progressing towards its goal of 4 million volunteer hours.

        "content": "S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s 2024 Trends in Fintech highlighted 10 trends for this year, which will culminate in the industry\u2019s return to a more normal business environment. While it doesn\u2019t provide fintech stocks to buy, it does provide hints on where to look in 2024.\u00a0The report\u2019s executive summary stated:\n\n\u201cWith the \u2018fast growth fueled by cheap capital\u2019 era of fintech now firmly in the rearview mirror, 2023 has been marked by rightsizing and a recommitment to business fundamentals across the sector. With capital in shorter supply, the line between fintechs that have found product-market fit and those that have not is clearer than ever before.\u201d\n\nSo, who are these fintechs that have found product-market fit? I\u2019ll consider companies participating in and benefiting from three of the 10 trends covered by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are my three fintech stocks to buy for 2024 and beyond.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock has gotten hammered in 2024, down over 29% year-to-date. It trades within 50 cents of a 52-week low.\n\nOf the 10 trends covered in the above-mentioned report, the second pertains to banking as a service (BaaS). The S&P Global Market Intelligence report stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we are believers in the long-term potential of banking as a service (BaaS), current market conditions could impede the growth prospects of numerous startups in this highly saturated segment.\u201d\n\nWhile investors tend to think about SoFi\u2019s student, personal and home loan lending platform, the company also has a tech business, Galileo Technologies, which helps financial services companies create new products more quickly and effectively.\u00a0Seth McGuire, Chief Revenue Officer at Galileo, said:\n\n\u201cAs a leading enabler of BaaS and embedded finance, Galileo, and companies like Central Payments, are transforming the way financial services are delivered. Our API-forward approach and scalable, extensible platform enables innovative brands to build the next generation of financial products to meet customers at their point of need.\u201d\n\nSoFi\u2019s tech platform generated 151 million accounts in Q1 2024, 20% higher than a year earlier. That translated into $94.4 million in revenue, 21% higher than a year earlier, while its contribution profit was $30.7 million, 107% higher than Q1.\n\nIt will become a more important part of SoFi\u2019s overall business in the quarters ahead, bolstering SoFi\u2019s presence as one of the fintech stocks to buy.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), its largest rival, have stock returns attached at the hip. In 2024, MA stock is up over 5%, 72 basis points higher. Over the past year, it\u2019s up nearly 20%, 53 basis points higher. Lastly, over the past five years, it\u2019s up over 66%, 889 basis points higher than Visa.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that both payment processors have underperformed the S&P 500.\n\nOf the 10 trends from the report, Mastercard is using generative AI to detect fraudulent use of bank cards. Mastercard\u2019s May 22 press release stated:\n\n\u201cThe new technology works by scanning transaction data across billions of cards and millions of merchants at faster rates than previously imaginable. In doing so it alerts Mastercard to new, complex fraud patterns. Using generative AI-based predictive technology built by Mastercard it is able to protect future transactions against emerging threats.\u201d\n\nThanks to the new technology, it can detect comprised cards twice as fast as in the past. That\u2019s great news if you have a Mastercard-branded bank card.\n\nMastercard\u2019s operating margin in Q1 2024 was 56.8%, 220 basis points higher than a year earlier. It\u2019s got plenty of free cash flow to pay for new technology development \u2014 $10.62 billion in the trailing 12 months \u2014 to keep shareholders confident about their long-term investments.\n\nCannae (CNNE) SPY ETF: The S&P 500 Will Go Higher but Investor Patience is Necessary. fintech stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCannae (NYSE:CNNE) is the least fintech-related of the three stocks. However, because the company has underperformed over the past five years, it makes a good under-the-radar, sum-of-the-parts play.\n\nThe company is led by William Foley II \u2014 amongst his many jobs, he is the Chairman of the Foley Entertainment Group, which owns the NHL\u2019s Vegas Golden Knights \u2014 who stepped back into the role of CEO in February to try to reverse the losses the holding company generated in 2023. The former CEO, Richard Massie, is now Vice Chairman. He will help Foley look for new investment opportunities.\n\nCannae was spun off in 2017 from Fidelity National Financial Ventures, a tracking stock of Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF), another Foley-founded company, where he is Non-Executive Chairman and owns 3.4% of the stock.\n\nOne of the companies owned by Cannae is Computer Services, a business that delivers fintech, regtech and cybersecurity solutions to financial institutions and corporate customers, both foreign and domestic. As S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s 8th trend states, \u201cRegtech will have its moment\u201d in 2024. Cannae\u2019s 6.4% interest in CSI was worth $88 million as of March 31.\n\nIts biggest investment is a 15.6% stake in Dun & Bradstreet Holdings (NYSE:DUNB), valued at $705 million at the end of March, down from $828 million at the end of December. D&B is working with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to drive other organizations\u2019 adoption of generative AI.\n\nAs of May 31, its net asset value (NAV) per share of $32.83. It trades at a 45% discount to its NAV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #77, which places it in the top 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\r\n\r\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector & S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Integrated Systems industry has underperformed the broader Computer and Technology sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the past year.\r\n\r\nThe industry has returned 17.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500 and the broader Computer and Technology sector\u2019s respective returns of 23.3% and 32.4%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the trailing 12-month P/S, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer-integrated systems stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 1.82X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 4.04X.

The combination of each company's portfolio and talent will deliver clients extensive application, infrastructure and security lifecycle management capabilities. The Qiskit Runtime Service simplifies the execution of quantum circuits, while the Qiskit Code Assistant, powered by watsonx-based generative AI models, automates the development of quantum code.\r\n\r\nIncreased watsonx adoption by clients is a tailwind.\u00a0 The watsonx Code Assistant enables developers and IT operators to code more quickly and precisely with the assistance of generative AI. The usage of natural language ensures developers from various skill sets have access to automation across business operations\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings has moved south by a penny to $9.91 per share in the past 30 days. IBM\u2019s shares have gained 2% year to date.\n\nPrice & Consensus: IBM\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise: The company is benefiting from strong executions in clearing backlogs and increased customer acceptance. HPE\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investment plan to expand networking capabilities will help diversify its business from server and hardware storage markets and boost margins over the long run. Also, easing supply-chain challenges will help it clear backlogs rapidly.\r\n\r\nHewlett Packard views AI, the Industrial Internet of Things and distributed computing as the next major markets. The company\u2019s latest agreement to acquire Juniper Networks is not just a financial move but a strategic leap to elevate its competitive stance by expanding its networking domain, particularly in the realms of AI, cloud and hybrid solutions.\r\n\r\nHPE has been expanding its AIOps network management capabilities by integrating multiple generative AI Large Language Models within HPE Aruba Networking Central, HPE\u2019s cloud-native network management solution, hosted on the HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform.\r\n\r\nThe company has been benefiting from continued growth in the sales of its accelerator processing unit, primarily driven by rising demand of HPE Cray EX, Cray XT and HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI-optimized servers.

        "title": "International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.32 indicates a change of +4.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.04 billion and $66.08 billion estimates indicate +1.9% and +4.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM.

        "title": "The 3 Best AI System Integrator Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "System integrators combine multiple technology products, usually made by a variety of companies, on behalf of clients. Among the world\u2019s best-known system integrators are Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and India\u2019s Wipro (NYSE:WIT). Many companies around the world are looking to utilize AI. Indeed, according to a recent survey by Gartner, 46% of chief information officers globally are seeking to implement AI systems, but only 4% have experience with launching AI. As a result, many if not most of the companies which decide to utilize AI on a wide scale for the first time are likely to hire system integrators. For investors who want to exploit this trend, here are the three best AI systems integrator stocks to buy now.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is known for creating and marketing its own software which enables companies to easily implement AI. However, C3.ai also helps its clients utilize systems from other vendors, including third party data, sensor networks and applications from the major cloud infrastructure firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). As a result, I view C3.ai as a system integrator.\n\nThe firm has accumulated an impressive list of customers, including Shell (NYSE:SHEL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the U.S. Air Force, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Raytheon Technologies. And C3.ai has become very ubiquitous in federal agencies, as it closed 65 deals with Washington last year alone. What\u2019s more, the company\u2019s revenue from the federal government jumped over 100% last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn May 29, C3.ai reported very impressive Q4 results as its revenue jumped 20% versus the same period a year earlier to $86.6 million. Moreover, its net cash used in operating activities dropped to $62.36 million from $115.69 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) specializes in carrying out system integration on behalf of federal agencies. AI is becoming a major revenue generator for the company. Indeed, it estimates about 5.6% of its revenue, or about $600 million, during fiscal year 2023 was related to AI. The firm is looking to nearly double that number to $1 billion in the next couple of years.\n\nSince the Biden Administration recently ordered federal agencies to step up their use of AI, I believe that Booz Allen can meet its goal, greatly boosting its financial results and BAH stock in the process.\n\nThe company reported strong overall Q4 2023 results as its top line climbed 14% year-over-year to $2.77 billion. Meanwhile, its operating income nearly doubled to $254 million versus $138.8 million YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooz Allen\u2019s high leverage to the federal government which is poised to rapidly implement AI make Booz one of the best AI system integrator stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIn recent weeks, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made several key deals that should enable it to meaningfully expand its AI integration business.\n\nOn May 8, the company disclosed that it would partner with European software giant SAP (NYSE:SAP) to create new generative AI and cloud solutions. Specifically, IBM will add AI functionality to SAP\u2019s offerings. The agreement should lead to IBM getting many new deals to help SAP\u2019s many customers learn how to effectively integrate and utilize these new capabilities. Indeed, the companies noted that IBM\u2019s consultants will \u201ctransform the way they deliver SAP solutions to boost productivity and mitigate risk by leveraging generative AI.\u201d\n\nOn May 15, IBM announced that its consultants would begin integrating Palo Alto\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) AI-powered security products to customers. Given the high popularity of Palo Alto\u2019s IT security tools, the deal should be a positive needle mover for IBM.\n\nFinally, IBM recently said that it would buy software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). According to Bank of America, the deal will make IBM\u2019s software for private clouds more appealing. As a result, IBM will likely get more cloud migration deals, many of which c0uld also include AI integration opportunities, going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw IBM (IBM) ending at $165.63, denoting a -0.85% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.6%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.86%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.08%.\n\nThe technology and consulting company's stock has climbed by 1.59% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.76% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of IBM in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 24, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.17, reflecting a 0.46% decrease from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.58 billion, up 0.67% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $9.91 per share and a revenue of $63.04 billion, indicating changes of +3.01% and +1.91%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for IBM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.11% decrease. IBM presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, IBM currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.85. This valuation marks no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.85.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM's PEG ratio is currently 4.12. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Integrated Systems industry stood at 2.51 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 77, putting it in the top 31% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Top Analyst Reports for JPMorgan Chase, Chevron &amp; Cisco",
        "content": "Thursday, May 30, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), as well as two micro-cap stocks Atrion Corporation (ATRI) and The Eastern Company (EML).\n\nThe Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+51.0% vs. +45.1%). High rates for longer time period, strategic buyouts and partnerships, opening new branches and solid loan balance will aid net interest income (NII), though higher funding costs will weigh on it.\r\n\r\nWhile there has been a resurgence in global deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time. Thus, the performance of the investment banking (IB) business is not expected to improve much anytime soon. The volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will likely hamper fee income.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nChevron shares have gained +9.4% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry\u2019s gain of +16.4%. The company is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin.\r\n\r\nFurther, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana. However, the company is grappling with high sensitivity to oil price fluctuations and relatively expensive valuation.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Cisco have declined -3.7% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Networking industry\u2019s decline of -5.6%. The company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2024 results suffered from weak networking revenues. However, security and observability revenues grew year over year.\r\n\r\nIt witnessed product order growth in two of its largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as in security and collaboration. Cisco\u2019s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. The addition of Splunk further enhances recurring revenue base of the company.\r\n\r\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in annualized recurring revenue and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\r\n\r\nAtrion shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the year-to-date period (+23.2% vs. -1.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $810.28 million has a strong cash position and a $25 million credit facility support financial stability and future growth.\r\n\r\nThe growing global medical devices market presents significant opportunities for Atrion, leveraging trends like chronic diseases and an aging population. Geographic diversification, with robust U.S. revenues and international contributions, mitigates regional risks.\r\n\r\nHowever, COGS increased by 40.4%, resulting in declining gross margins due to higher manufacturing costs and a $2.3 million inventory write-off. High inventory levels, regulatory risks, and competitive pressures from major players could strain profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Atrion here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eastern Company have outperformed the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry over the year-to-date period (+29.2% vs. +11.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $179.46 million have successful customer relationships and a stable order flow, providing a solid foundation for sustained growth.\r\n\r\nOperational efficiencies are evident with a $3.5 million inventory reduction and improved gross margin of 24% from 21% in Q1 2023, driven by cost-saving initiatives. Eastern's financial health is strengthened by reducing long-term debt. A robust 83-year history of 334 consecutive quarterly dividends underscores financial stability and shareholder value.\r\n\r\nVertical integration and strategic M&A opportunities aim to boost profitability. However, a 6% sales decline in Q1 2024, supply chain disruptions, cost inflation, competitive pressures, dependence on key customers, and regulatory risks pose challenges.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eastern Company here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuit Inc. (INTU), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Protect Against the Collapse of the American Family",
        "content": "We\u2019re in the middle of a Baby Bust. Births have been trending sharply lower since 2007. The number of babies born in America is now at its lowest level since 1979.\n\nAccording to the research platform Microtrends, the current birth rate for the U.S. is 1.787 live births per woman. That\u2019s less than the 2.1 births per woman a nation needs to simply replace itself from one generation to the next (excluding immigration).\n\nIn 1979, the birth rate was 1.81 live births per woman. That doesn\u2019t seem very much bigger than today until you put it in perspective: Our population today \u2013 at 333.3 million \u2013 is 48% bigger than it was \u2013 at 225.1 million \u2013 in 1979.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means the number of babies born now is far lower than 1979 levels. In short, our birth rate has plummeted, as is clearly visible in the chart below.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nAnd what effect is it having?\n\nLet\u2019s address one question at a time.\n\nWhy Are Americans Today Having so Few Children?\n\nThe simple answer is that they\u2019re broke and can\u2019t afford them.\n\nMost would-be parents are not financially prepared enough to start families when they kick off their professional lives buried in tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in student-loan debt.\n\nEven if they were ready for that white picket fence in the suburbs, they\u2019d have a hard time finding an affordable house. According to Redfin, home affordability is the worst it\u2019s been in nearly 40 years\u2026 and that assumes two working parents. Having a new mom take time off to be with her baby is pure fantasy for most young couples.\n\nTo add insult to injury, white-collar hiring across much of the U.S. \u2013 in industries such as finance, technology, media, law, and accounting \u2013 has stalled. So starting your career and growing in it is as hard as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nThis is borne out by an increasing number of reports in mainstream media decrying the shortage of college-level jobs available for new graduates. And white-collar jobs in the entertainment and technology sectors are increasingly hard to come by as some of the biggest employers \u2013 such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) subsidiary Optum \u2013 continue layoffs.\n\nThis is increasingly leading to a troubling trend of underemployment amongst college graduates. According to New York Times\u2019 columnist Peter Coy, 52% of college grads are underemployed a year after graduation, working in jobs that don\u2019t require the degrees they earned. A decade after graduation, 45% of graduates are underemployed.\n\nStory continues\n\nNever mind that these young adults are trying to start a career and family saddled with student loan debt. The average federal student loan debt in 2023 was $37,088. The total average (including private loan debt) is $39,981.\n\nAll of this is to say that young adults are increasingly delaying starting a family and having children because they simply cannot afford to do so. They can barely afford to move out of their parents\u2019 house, let alone feed and raise little humans that not only cost a fortune to feed and educate, but also require daycare \u2013 itself an exorbitant expense \u2013 for both parents to work.\n\nPointing the Finger\n\nWe can thank the Federal Reserve and governmental financial incompetence for this mess.\n\nWhen the Fed injected $5 trillion into the monetary system during the pandemic, it inflated the prices of virtually all assets, including homes. The resulting inflation forced the central bank to then aggressively raise interest rates, which made affordability even worse.\n\nAnd a deficit rising by $1 trillion every 100 days is exacerbating the inflation problem.\n\nI don\u2019t see any of this getting better any time soon.\n\nThe forces pushing Americans into having smaller families or not having families at all don\u2019t turn on a dime. If anything, they\u2019ll likely get worse before they get better.\n\nAll we can do is protect ourselves from the potential fallout.\n\nThis requires smart \u2013 and agile \u2013 investing.\n\nHave inflation hedges in your investment portfolio.\n\nInvest in companies with good track records in essential industries. And add short-term investing \u2013 even trading \u2013 to your wealth-creation arsenal.\n\nHere are three stocks to buy now to achieve all three goals\u2026 and ultimately protect you against the ravages a declining population (a topic for another day) will have on the U.S. economy.\n\nProtection Stock No. 1: National Retail Properties (NNN) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nTens of millions of Americans depend on Social Security to meet their basic income needs in retirement. But a pay-as-you-go system like this isn\u2019t fundamentally different from a Ponzi scheme. It works so long as there are a lot of young workers paying into the system and relatively few retirees drawing benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s not the situation today\u2026 and the lower the birth rate goes or the longer it stays depressed, the worse the math gets.\n\nNo politician wants to touch this \u2013 they call Social Security the \u201cthird rail of American politics\u201d for a reason \u2013 but math is math.\n\nIf you still have a few years until you draw Social Security, you should just assume that substantially all of it will be taxed and that your benefits will likely shrink, at least relative to inflation.\n\nThis means you need income. One nice source of reliable and growing income is in high-traffic, mission-critical real estate.\n\nTake a look at National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN). This real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a diverse portfolio of convenience stores, car washes, and other properties that tend to be both recession proof and future proof.\n\nThe stock sports a dividend yield of 5.4%, in line with T-bills.\n\nBut unlike bond interest \u2013 which is fixed \u2013 NNN\u2019s dividend has historically risen over time. It\u2019s raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years and counting.\n\nA stock like this can help to supplement shortfalls in your Social Security check.\n\nProtection Stock No. 2: SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM) A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDemographic pressures are going to put enormous strain on the dollar in the decades ahead. I can\u2019t tell you exactly how this plays out, but I expect it to look something like this\u2026\n\nThe national debt is already closing in on $35 trillion. We\u2019re adding an extra trillion every 100 days. That\u2019s not sustainable. At some point, our lenders \u2013 the bond market \u2013 will balk, requiring a much higher interest rate to compensate for the higher risk of a borrower this deeply in debt.\n\nAt that point, selling bonds becomes prohibitively expensive\u2026 so the Federal Reserve steps in and effectively directly finances the government.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have at least a couple dollar hedges in your portfolio, you\u2019re risking your financial future.\n\nOne of the best and most reliable dollar hedges is gold. You could buy coins and keep them somewhere safe, of course. But for your IRA or other financial accounts, it\u2019s generally going to be easier to buy an ETF like the SPDR Gold MiniShares (NYSEARCA:GLDM).\n\nProtection Stock No. 3: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnd finally, throughout war, peace, inflation, deflation, and every manner of financial calamity, America\u2019s biggest and best-run blue-chip companies have a way of surviving and thriving. This is why, at The Freeport Society, we call them the \u201crich man\u2019s super currency.\u201d\n\nAs a long-term wealth protector and grower, you need quality growth companies. One such company is the AI chip darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThis is a company that has redefined itself twice in the past decade alone, evolving from a maker of video game graphics chips to a maker of Bitcoin mining chips. Now it\u2019s becoming the leading maker of the chips needed to power the AI boom.\n\nThe stock looks a bit rich at today\u2019s prices, so you might want to wait for a pullback before jumping in. But regardless, always make sure that your portfolio has a core of quality growth stocks.\n\nWith these three stocks, and others along the same lines, you can prepare yourself from the fall out of the collapsing American family.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Sizemore held a LONG position in NNN and BTC-USD.

        "content": "Bank of America raised its price target for Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) from $130 to $180, driven by strong AI momentum and new product launches unveiled at Dell Technologies World 2024.\n\nThe target increase and comments from BofA helped lift Dell's shares by more than 2% on Wednesday.\n\nThe bank's analysts reiterated their \"Buy\" rating on Dell, citing a positive outlook for the company heading into the fiscal second quarter of 2025.\n\nKey factors include robust demand for AI servers, storage driven by an IBM (NYSE:IBM) mainframe refresh, and an expected PC refresh. During the recent Dell Technologies World event, the company introduced Dell AI Factory and expanded its AI portfolio with five new AI-enabled PCs, all-flash file storage, network architecture, and AI services offerings.\n\nThe bank sees these innovations supporting Dell's growth in the coming year.\n\nIn the first quarter, Dell reported shipping $800 million worth of AI servers, with backlog doubling quarter-over-quarter to $2.9 billion and order growth of 40%. BofA expects AI server revenue to reach $1.4 billion this quarter, with backlog potentially growing to $4-5 billion.\n\nBofA adjusted its fiscal 2025 revenue and EPS estimates to $92.9 billion and $7.84, respectively, reflecting confidence in the upside of AI demand.\n\nThe firm also noted that Dell, which it feels \"remains under-owned and underweighted,\" could benefit from AI-related growth and potential inclusion in the S&P 500.\n\nThis bullish outlook underscores Dell's strategic positioning to capitalize on the expanding AI market, reinforcing its long-term growth prospects.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDell stock target lifted at BofA on AI momentum; shares rally\n\nEV switch to hit auto suppliers hard, Stellantis CEO says\n\nUS tells owners to stop driving older Nissan vehicles over air bag concerns\n\nView comments",

        "content": "More than half of Canadian CEOs say they are hiring for positions that did not exist last year due to generative AI, but struggle to fill key technology roles. 72% of Canadian CEOs reveal they will take on more risk than their competition to outcompete. 62% of Canadian CEOs say the productivity gains from automation are so great they are willing to accept more risk.\n\nMARKHAM, ON, May 29, 2024 /CNW/ -- A study by the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Institute for Business Value found that AI is fueling new job creation and risk-taking among surveyed Canadian CEOs as they prioritize generative AI to maintain and enhance their competitive edge in the global market while simultaneously transforming their workforce to meet new demands. Canadian CEOs are prioritizing generative AI to maintain and enhance their competitive edge, according to a new study from IBM. At the annual THINK conference last week, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna announced updates to the IBM watsonx AI and data platform one year after its introduction, as well as upcoming data and automation capabilities designed to make AI more open, cost effective, and flexible for businesses.\n\nCanada was one of 30 countries included in this annual global IBM study of 3,000 CEOs. Key themes dominating the Canadian findings include the willingness of CEOs to accept more risk in an increasingly competitive landscape driven by generative AI. In fact, 64% of Canadian CEOs believe that competitive advantage depends on having the most advanced generative AI capabilities, higher than the global average of 59%. Additionally, 62% of Canadian CEOs say the productivity gains from automation are so great they must accept more risk\u00a0to stay competitive, and 72% say they will take more risk than the competition\u00a0to maintain their competitive edge.\n\n\"We are at a tipping point with generative AI as Canadian business leaders are transitioning from experimentation to integration that delivers real business impact,\" said Craig Eaket, Managing Partner, IBM Consulting Canada. \"As with any transformational change, there are challenges but there is also widespread recognition of a tremendous opportunity with AI for increased productivity. The potential business value is extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Process automation is not about replacing an individual. It's about enhancing the value of individuals\u2014making human work more human,\" said Javier Tamargo, CEO, 407 ETR. \"AI has a role in helping us advance to provide better service to our customers.\"\n\nThe findings also show that generative AI continues to fuel significant workforce changes. While more than half of Canadian CEOs reveal they have not yet assessed the impact of generative AI on their employees, they do believe the workforce will grow by nearly 6% over the next three years. In fact, while 59% of surveyed Canadians CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, 52% reveal they are hiring for roles that did not exist last year due to generative AI. Despite this push, however, 58% of Canadian CEOs say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles, highlighting the ongoing challenge of finding qualified talent.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe IBM study also reveals that CEOs recognize good governance is essential to effective generative AI, an area for which Canadian CEOs give themselves top marks. Of all the countries surveyed, Canadian CEOs are most satisfied with their AI governance plans, with 48% saying they have good governance in place today, significantly higher than the global average of 39%. Brazil reported in at second place with 43% and the United States' self-assessment ranked them last with 32%.\n\nOther key study findings include:\n\nJust 22% of Canadian CEOs see customer experience as important for enterprise transformation, lower than the global average of 30%. More Canadian CEOs (35%) categorize efficiency and cost savings as the key objective in their AI deployment than the global average of 26%. 43% of Canadian CEOs are prioritizing technology modernization over the next three years (9% more than the global average), and 34% are prioritizing their ecosystem and partnerships, higher than the global average of 24%.\n\nTo view the full study, including actionable strategies to help organizations navigate the complexity of generative AI adoption, visit: https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/QJ2BYLZG\r\nFor more information about IBM Canada, visit www.ibm.com/ca-en\n\nStudy Methodology: The IBM Institute for Business Value, in cooperation with Oxford Economics, conducted interviews with 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 26 industries from December 2023 through April 2024 as part of the 29th edition of the IBM C-Suite Study series. These conversations focused on business priorities, leadership, technology, talent, partnering, regulation, industry disruption and enterprise transformation.\n\nMedia Contact Lorraine Baldwin\r\nIBM Canada Communications\r\nlorraine@ca.ibm.com IBM Corporation logo.

        "title": "The Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Dividend stocks can be boring, especially when AI-fueled stock gains are proliferating. Still, for long-term investors, buying sustainable dividend stocks with solid growth potential is a timeless strategy.\n\nTwo dividend stocks worth buying right now are telecom giant AT&T(NYSE: T) and tech heavyweight International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM).\n\nWireless and fiber growth\n\nWhile rival Verizon has been shedding wireless subscribers, AT&T has been consistently growing its wireless customer base. Growth has slowed in recent quarters, the result of a pandemic-era boom fading away, but the company is still producing solid results.\n\nAT&T added nearly 350,000 net postpaid phone subscribers in the first quarter, a solid result in the current environment. Postpaid phone churn dipped down to just 0.72%, its lowest level in at least two years. A combination of consistent customer growth and minimal customer losses has been driving wireless service revenue higher.\n\nAT&T's fiber business is also performing well. AT&T had 8.6 million fiber subscribers at the end of the first quarter after adding 252,000. Average revenue per fiber subscriber has been consistently moving higher, and the company sees a path to grow its fiber network to pass as many as 50% more locations than its original plan. Fiber should be a solid growth driver for many years to come.\n\nAT&T expects to generate free cash flow between $17 billion and $18 billion this year even as it continues to invest heavily in its wireless and fiber networks. The stock is dirt cheap, trading for just 7 times the midpoint of that free-cash-flow outlook, and the dividend is hard to resist.\n\nAT&T hasn't raised its quarterly dividend since slashing it in the wake of the spinoff of WarnerMedia two years ago. Even so, the $0.2775 per-share quarterly payout works out to a dividend yield of about 6.4%. The company plans to reach its debt reduction targets by mid-2025, after which dividend increases or even share buybacks could be on the table.\n\nA return to dividend growth or a share buyback program next year could be the push the market needs to knock AT&T stock out of its rock-bottom valuation. As investors wait for the stock to recover, they can collect a sustainable high-yield dividend that will only eat up about 45% of free cash flow this year.\n\nAn enterprise AI leader\n\nIBM has a few things going for it as the tech giant aims to become the go-to enterprise AI platform. First, the company has embraced strategic partnerships with leading cloud providers and other technology companies. These partnerships generate billions of dollars in business annually for IBM, and the company's Watsonx AI platform is being integrated by IBM's partners.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, IBM's consulting business can provide a complete solution to customers who not only want AI software but also guidance and implementation services. IBM's consulting arm can craft solutions combining IBM's products and services as well as the products and services of its strategic partners. The majority of AI-related business for IBM so far has been on the consulting side, a testament to the importance of consulting to IBM's business model.\n\nWhile AI is still a small contributor to IBM's revenue, it has the potential to accelerate growth in the years ahead. As it stands today, IBM has returned to consistent, albeit modest, revenue and free-cash-flow growth. The company expects revenue to expand by a mid-single-digit percentage, excluding currency, this year, with free cash flow of about $12 billion.\n\nLike AT&T, IBM's dividend growth has been slow in recent years. The company recently boosted its quarterly dividend by less than 1% to $1.67, which works out to a forward dividend yield of 3.9%. The dividend will consume about half of IBM's free cash flow this year, so quicker dividend growth will likely require quicker free-cash-flow growth.\n\nAI could be the key to accelerating IBM's free-vash-flow growth in the years ahead as the company wins over enterprise AI clients. Until then, investors can collect a nice dividend every quarter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AT&T wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "IBM (IBM) Up 1% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for IBM (IBM). Shares have added about 1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IBM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nIBM's Q1 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss Despite Solid Demand\r\n\r\nIBM started 2024 on a positive note with relatively modest first-quarter results. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but the top line missed the same despite solid demand. The company witnessed healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and AI solutions with a client-focused portfolio and broad-based growth and remains firmly on track to reach its targets for 2024.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $1,575 million or $1.69 per share compared with $934 million or $1.02 per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line growth and income tax benefits.\r\n\r\nExcluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $1.68 per share compared with $1.36 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents.\n\nQuarter Details\n\nQuarterly total revenues increased to $14,462 million from $14,252 million on strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% year over year. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $14,572 million.\r\n\r\nGross profit improved to $7,742 million from $7,509 million in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 53.5% and 52.7% owing to a strong portfolio mix. Total expenses increased to $6,669 million from $6,451 million, driven by higher interest expense and R&D costs.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nSoftware: Revenues improved to $5,899 million from $5,591 million, driven by growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, Red Hat, Automation, Data & AI and Transaction Processing. The reported segment revenues missed our estimate of $5,998 million despite solid hybrid cloud traction. Segment pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1,500 million compared with $1,379 million in the year-ago quarter for margins of 25.4% and 24.7%, respectively. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation and Data & AI.\r\n\r\nConsulting: Revenues were $5,186 million compared with $5,197 million a year ago, led by pervasive growth driven by demand for digital transformation, increasing revenues across most business lines and regions. The segment\u2019s revenues missed our estimate of $5,340 million. Segment pre-tax income was relatively flat at $424 million for a margin of 8.2%.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure: Revenues were $3,076 million compared with $3,098 million, as lower demand for support services was partially offset by higher demand for hybrid and distributed infrastructure. Segment pre-tax income was $311 million compared with $307 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 10.1% and 9.9%.\r\n\r\nFinancing: Revenues remained almost flat at $193 million. Segment pre-tax income was $92 million compared with $100 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 47.7% and 51.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nDuring the first quarter, IBM generated $4,168 million in cash from operations compared with $3,774 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was $1,910 million in the quarter, up from $1,340 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher profit and working capital efficiencies. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company had $14,603 million in cash and cash equivalents with $54,033 million of long-term debt.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor full-year 2024, the company reiterated its revenue growth expectations in the mid-single digit on a constant currency basis. Free cash flow is expected to be in the vicinity of $12 billion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -5.19% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, IBM has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should Salesforce (CRM) be in Your Portfolio Before Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "Salesforce CRM is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 29.\n\nSalesforce, a leader in customer relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d) software, has demonstrated strong financial performance and innovative advancements. The company\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.1%.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, the company projects total revenues between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion (midpoint $9.145 billion). Non-GAAP earnings are expected between $2.37 and $2.39 per share.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.14 billion, which indicates an increase of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.38 per share, which implies a year-over-year rise of 40.8%.\n\nSalesforce's year-to-date (YTD) share price performance has been marked by significant volatility, reflecting broader market fluctuations. YTD, CRM stock has risen 5.8%, underperforming the Zacks Computer \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 11.2%.\n\nAs Salesforce approaches its first-quarter earnings announcement, let\u2019s examine whether now is the right time to buy shares.\n\nSalesforce Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSalesforce Inc. price-eps-surprise | Salesforce Inc. Quote\n\nFinancial Performance & Growth Prospects\n\nSalesforce has consistently delivered robust financial results, reflecting its strong market position and innovative product offerings. In the last reported quarter, Salesforce\u2019s revenues increased 11% year over year to $9.26 billion, while non-GAAP earnings soared 36% to $2.29 per share. This growth was driven by strong demand for its cloud-based CRM solutions and strategic acquisitions that have broadened its service offerings.\n\nThe company's guidance for fiscal 2025 has been optimistic, projecting revenues between $37.7 billion and $38 billion. This outlook suggests continued confidence in the business's ability to capture market share and expand its customer base. Salesforce's focus on innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence and automation, positions it well to meet evolving customer needs.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues and non-GAAP earnings is pegged at $37.93 billion and $9.71 per share, respectively. This indicates a year-over-year improvement of 8.8% in the top line and 18.1% in the bottom line. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings growth rate currently stands at 15.2%, which is significantly higher than the industry\u2019s average growth of 12.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrengthening Market Position\n\nSalesforce holds a dominant position in the CRM market, competing with other tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Its comprehensive suite of CRM applications, combined with its extensive partner ecosystem, provides a significant advantage. Gartner has consistently ranked Salesforce as a leader in the CRM space, underscoring its strong market presence.\n\nSalesforce's strategy includes targeted acquisitions that enhance its technology stack and market reach. The acquisition of Slack in 2021 for $27.7 billion exemplifies this approach, integrating communication and collaboration tools into its CRM platform. This buyout has driven cross-sell opportunities and deepened customer engagement for Salesforce. Additionally, the acquisitions of Spiff and Arikit.ai startups in 2023 have further strengthened its capabilities and market position.\n\nSalesforce is continuously expanding its generative AI offerings to tap the growing opportunities in the space. The company forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. In June 2023, it further elevated the set of its generative AI tools with the launch of the AI Cloud service. With this, the company claims to offer one-stop AI-powered solutions for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.\n\nStrong Partner Base Aids Prospects\n\nSalesforce's growth is significantly bolstered by strategic partnerships with other tech giants, enhancing its market position and expanding its technological capabilities. Collaborations with companies like International Business Machines IBM, Amazon\u2019s AMZN Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google Cloud have been pivotal.\n\nSalesforce's recent partnership with IBM to integrate IBM\u2019s watsonx AI and Data Platform with the Salesforce Einstein 1 Platform signifies its commitment to leveraging AI to deliver more personalized and efficient customer experiences. These innovations are likely to enhance Salesforce's competitive edge and attract more enterprise clients.\n\nWith Amazon\u2019s AWS, Salesforce has deepened its cloud capabilities, offering more robust, scalable solutions for enterprise customers. This partnership facilitates seamless data integration and management, crucial for businesses undergoing digital transformation. By leveraging AWS' infrastructure, Salesforce can deliver faster, more reliable services, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nThe alliance with Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud integrates Google's data analytics and AI tools with Salesforce\u2019s CRM, providing customers with powerful insights and more efficient business processes. This collaboration enhances Salesforce\u2019s ability to offer data-driven solutions, helping clients make informed decisions and optimize their operations.\n\nOverall, these strategic partnerships enable Salesforce to innovate rapidly, expand its service offerings and strengthen its competitive edge, driving sustained growth and market leadership.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSalesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nA strong portfolio, along with its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs, reflects solid top-line growth potential over the long run. Despite its strengths, Salesforce faces several risks that can undermine its near-term prospects. The global economic environment remains uncertain, with potential headwinds from protracted inflationary conditions, still-high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. These factors could impact enterprise spending on software and IT services.\n\nMoreover, Salesforce\u2019s valuation looks stretched at the current level, as reflected by the Value Score of D. We note that Salesforce currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 45.1. This level compares unfavorably to the industry average of 38.4. Hence, it would be prudent for investors to wait for a better entry time.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.25% lower. Right now, IBM possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that IBM has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.52 right now. This valuation marks no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.52.\n\nAlso, we should mention that IBM has a PEG ratio of 4.28. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. Computer - Integrated Systems stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.51 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, placing it within the top 36% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking to take a new position in your portfolio in tech stocks, there\u2019s no time like the present. In fact, perhaps you\u2019re a little late to the game. But late is better than never when it comes to finding the top tech stocks to buy.\n\nTech stocks are driving the stock market and have done so for the last year. The growth of generative AI launched a revolution in tech stocks, as many companies are looking for new ways to incorporate AI in their platforms.\n\nFor tech stocks, there\u2019s a lot more to consider than just AI. Tech stocks also represent companies that are involved in hardware, software, cybersecurity, renewable energy technology and communications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are companies that must be consistently innovating and growing to stay ahead of the curve. And that could lead to significant returns for investors.\n\nTech stocks are appealing because the companies they represent are deft at adapting and pivoting in response to market demands and technological advancements. While they can sometimes be volatile, top tech stocks trend higher over the long term, so it makes sense to take a new position in some top-rated names.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader is our guide in finding the best tech stocks to buy, based on their earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum. If you don\u2019t already have a stake in these names, this could be an ideal time to make an initial investment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe\u2019re closing in on the sixth month of the year, but nothing\u2019s really changed with my enthusiasm for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe maker of highly advanced graphics processing units is perhaps the most gripping tech stock of the decade, with a market cap that\u2019s now north of $2 trillion.\n\nAnd even though NVDA stock pulled back a little bit in recent weeks, I see that as people taking their profits rather than doubting Nvidia\u2019s potential. If anything NVDA stock will be gathering momentum for another move higher.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 came out after the closing bell on May 22 and once again blew away expectations. Revenue was $26 billion, up 18% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and up 262% from a year ago. Data center revenue was $22.6 billion, up 427% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia also declared a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7, that will make the stock even more enticing to retail investors.\n\nNVDA stock is up 89% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn many ways, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) works hand-in-hand with Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia makes the powerful GPUs that are so popular these days, Supermicro handles the server architecture and custom bundling that is so essential to allow GPUs to work with each other to perform rapid calculations.\n\nThat\u2019s why SMCI stock has been on such an impressive run, up more than 200% so far this year.\n\nBut SMCI is also on sale \u2014 incredibly, the stock is down 20% from its April highs as investors speculated SMCI has gone up too fast, too quickly.\n\nThat\u2019s just shortsighted thinking. Supermicro earnings have tripled from a year ago and its earnings per share are up fourfold. And as Nvidia continues to roll out upgraded GPUs, Supermicro\u2019s server architecture will continue to be in demand.\n\nSCMI stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is looking a lot better today than it was in late 2022. That\u2019s when META stock hit a low as engagement and monthly active viewers were on the decline.\n\nMeta seemed to be more interested in the internet of the future \u2014 the metaverse \u2014 than the here and now.\n\nGranted, being a forward-thinking company is important in the tech realm. But Meta was dumping billions into building out the metaverse and hemorrhaging stock price.\n\nFortunately, CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that 2023 would be a year where Meta would focus on profits and what makes the company successful.\n\nAnd it worked. META stock is up 91% in the last 12 months, and the company is capitalizing on AI to make advertising more effective.\n\nIt\u2019s also creating some interested generative AI products that improve the user experience for its Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\n\nNow Meta Platforms counts roughly half the global population \u2014 nearly 4 billion people \u2014 as active monthly users. And META stock is once again one of the best tech stocks to buy. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI understand the skepticism that you may feel with this pick. But let\u2019s make a couple of things clear. First, investing in Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) isn\u2019t an endorsement of Donald Trump\u2019s policies or actions, nor is it a bet that he will win the November election.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s important to know that Trump Media is a highly speculative stock that is highly susceptible to the headlines of the day. It\u2019s not a trade for everyone.\n\nBut if you ignore the drama that surrounds Trump Media, you\u2019ll see that this is a trade about possibilities, not politics. X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and now held privately by Elon Musk, is not the powerhouse that it used to be.\n\nThere is a real opportunity for an alternative to step forward \u2014 which is what Meta Platforms did with its Threads platform.\n\nRight now, Trump Media isn\u2019t even close to making money. It will take a long time for it to scale and generate a profit.\n\nBut it may be worth a small, speculative investment today. The stock continues to have a lot of momentum behind it, which is why it still gets an \u201cA\u201d in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is pretty much the polar opposite of\u00a0 Trump Media, which goes to prove that top-rated tech stocks to buy come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nWhile Trump Media is a startup, Dell is a legacy hardware company that makes desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nBut Dell isn\u2019t acting like a legacy computer company. It\u2019s one of the hottest tech stocks in the market today, with gains of 91% so far in 2024. Investors are jumping all over DELL stock because of the company\u2019s large server business and the potential for companies to upgrade their servers to run AI applications.\n\nDell recorded fourth-quarter revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11% from a year ago. But net income of $1.15 billion was an increase of 91% from last year, and earnings per share of $1.59 was a big improvement from EPS of 84 cents in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nDELL stock is worth taking a position. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother legacy computing company that\u2019s acting more like a young pup than a grizzled hound is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)\n\nLike Dell, IBM is leaning heavily into AI to help power its profits. The company operates its watsonx generative AI platform and has booked more than $1 billion in business related to generative AI. Its software revenue was up 6% in the first quarter of 2024, and overall revenue was up 3%.\n\nIBM is also working on some new AI assistants that are scheduled to be available later this year, and it has partnerships with some of the biggest companies in the world to make watsonx widely accessible.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re an income investor, you have to appreciate IBM\u2019s dividend yield of nearly 4%.\n\nIBM stock is up 5% in 2024 and is recovering nicely from a pullback in April. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf the technology stocks on this list, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is the only that can be classified as a fintech stock.\n\nCoinbase operates a cryptocurrency trading platform that makes nearly 250 different types of assets available for buying, selling or trading.\n\nAnd even if you aren\u2019t interested in investing in cryptocurrency yourself, buying COIN stock allows you to monetize the growth of digital currency and the evolution of blockchain technology.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $1.58 billion, up from $736 million a year ago. The company also turned a profit of $1.17 billion after losing $79 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company managed to top expectations by boasting $511 million in subscription and services revenue, after forecasting a range between $410 million and $480 million.\n\nCOIN stock is up 31% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article both had long positions in NVDA and SCMI. They did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "$1,000 Goes a Long Way: 3 Stocks That Could Deliver Hefty Returns",
        "content": "Although it no longer takes money to make money on Wall Street, the more you have, the faster you can get to where you\u2019re going.\n\nYou can buy stocks with as little as $20 these days and not worry about getting skinned from transaction fees. But if you save up a little more cash you can buy more high-potential stocks, accelerating your ability to generate hefty returns from your investments.\n\nWith $1,000 to buy into a company, you can jump-start the journey of setting yourself up for a comfortable retirement. Below are three high-potential stocks to buy today, particularly if you have a cool grand available that you don\u2019t need for bills or emergencies. These are stellar companies with a fantastic track record and a long road of growth to look forward to.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDomino\u2019s (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nPizza shop Domino\u2019s (NYSE:DPZ) is the first company to buy with $1,000 to your name. Although it used to be known primarily for getting your cardboard-tasting pie delivered to you fast, a commitment to quality and getting it right rather than quick made it the premier pizza stock. What is still not realized by many is just how tasty Domino\u2019s dividend is. It might just be better than its stuffed cheesy bread.\n\nDomino\u2019s has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years. It has also increased the payout at a mind-bending 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over that time frame. That\u2019s nearly unheard of from dividend stalwarts let alone a pizza chain. Yet having found the secret of growth, Domino\u2019s shares its wealth with investors.\n\nBy now the pizzeria is well-known for its \u201cfortressing\u201d strategy of flooding a market with stores to create a critical mass of mindshare amongst consumers. Each store might not make as much, but Domino\u2019s sales overall increase. Revenue jumped 7.3% in the first quarter compared to a 5.9% increase a year ago. The stock has responded as well.\n\nDPZ shares are up 25% this year and are 65% higher over the last 12 months. For the past decade Domino\u2019s delivered a total return of 705%, nearly three times greater than the 241% return of the S&P 500. The power of capital appreciation and a rising dividend make Domino\u2019s an excellent high-potential stock to buy for the next decade of growth.\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome improvement expert Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) is another dividend powerhouse. It has increased its payout for over 50 years, making it a dividend king. Yet equally impressive is that in just the past five years it has doubled the dividend for investors. The payment went from from $2.06 per share in 2018 to $4.40 last year, a better than 16% CAGR.\n\nStory continues\n\nLowe\u2019s just reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, even though results were down year-over-year. The Federal Reserve\u2019s high-interest rate policies, coupled with elevated government-induced inflation rates, are pressuring retailers everywhere. Consumers are cutting back on big purchases as they must spend more on necessities.\n\nSales fell 4% in the quarter to $21.4 billion on a similar decline in comparable sales. Its professional business, however, saw positive comps for the period as it pushed harder to bring in more contractors. Compared to Home Depot (NYSE:HD), though, Lowe\u2019s has a higher concentration of do-it-yourself customers.\n\nStill, the DIY center reiterated it sees full-year sales guidance of $84 billion to $85 billion, in line with analyst estimates of $84.4 billion. Profits are forecast at $12.15 per share at the midpoint of its range, below Wall Street\u2019s $12.19 per share.\n\nLowe\u2019s has weathered such storms before and with the stock trading at 16 times earnings estimates and 20x free cash flow, it\u2019s a high-potential stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) also just reported earnings that are showing the ill effects of government and Fed policies. Although fiscal fourth-quarter results were mostly inline with expectations, bookings showed customers were stretching out their payments to cope with rising costs instead of paying upfront.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is consolidating its business under a single security platform intended to drive growth amongst enterprise-class customers. However, its results didn\u2019t suggest there was much meaningful movement in that direction as macroeconomic concerns impact their performance as well. The cybersecurity stock, though, deemed the response \u201centhusiastic\u201d and sees significant growth coming down the road.\n\nNew products designed for its AI-powered Cortex platform has potential to deliver greater performance. It also just signed a partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to deliver new AI enhanced security offerings. IBM will prefer Palo Alto as its cybersecurity partner across its network, cloud and security operations center (SOC).\n\nBecause these macro concerns will be relatively transitory, its results merely indicate a lag, not an abandonment of profitable growth and Palo Alto Networks is still a high-potential stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in LOW stock.

        "content": "Don\u2019t miss out on this exceptional chance to invest in quantum computing stocks to buy that could be millionaire makers while their valuations remain low. These innovative tech companies are developing cutting-edge quantum computing systems with the potential to generate massive returns for investors who get in early.\n\nThe quantum computing stocks featured below are poised to commercialize their technology across multiple industries. Quantum computing promises to transform various sectors of our world, from financial services to medical research. Also, it may enable groundbreaking advances and discoveries that aren\u2019t possible with traditional classical computing.\n\nThe three quantum computing stocks to buy outlined in this article represent the best opportunities investors have to compound their wealth to seven figures. We\u2019ve only just started to see the potential of this industry and understand the implications of this new tech.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, here are three quantum computing stocks for investors who want to earn a potential seven-figure sum.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) focuses on IT and quantum computing through its Intelligent Edge segment. The company has demonstrated significant achievements in quantum computing research.\r\n\r\nHPE\u2019s Intelligent Edge segment provides solutions that bring computation closer to the data source. Integrating quantum computing capabilities with Intelligent Edge technologies can offer unique advantages, such as real-time data processing and enhanced decision-making capabilities at the network\u2019s edge.\n\nMost recently, the Intelligent Edge segment reported revenue of $902 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year. This segment continues to grow, driven by strong demand for edge computing solutions. The company also achieved an EPS of $0.48, which surpassed the consensus estimate of $0.45. This compares to an EPS of $0.63 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nHPE is a well-known brand akin to a more modern version of IBM (NYSE:IBM). It could be a good pick for those who like to stay with the blue-chip options while also having the potential to mint new millionaires.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is a leader in developing trapped-ion quantum computers and making significant strides in the field. The company collaborates with major cloud platforms.\r\n\r\nIonQ\u2019s primary technology involves trapped-ion quantum computers, which utilize ions trapped in electromagnetic fields as qubits. This technology is known for its high-fidelity operations and stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, IonQ achieved a milestone of 35 algorithmic qubits with its IonQ Forte system, a year ahead of schedule. This achievement allows the system to handle more sophisticated and more extensive quantum circuits\u200b. IonQ\u2019s growth and technological advancements have been recognized in various industry lists, such as Fast Company\u2019s 2023 Next Big Things in Tech List and Deloitte\u2019s 2023 Technology Fast 500 List.\r\n\r\nWith a market cap of just 1.79 billion, it remains a small-cap quantum computing stock that could hold significant upside potential for investors. Its developments so far have been promising, and it could prove to be a company that will make early investors rich.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) RGTI penny stocks\n\nPure-play quantum computing company Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is known for its vertically integrated approach. This includes designing and manufacturing quantum processors.\n\nRigetti has achieved a significant milestone with its 128-qubit chip, which promises to advance quantum computing capabilities and enable new applications. This development is a key part of Rigetti\u2019s roadmap to scale up quantum systems and improve performance metrics.\r\n\r\nAlso,\u00a0 in Q1 2024, Rigetti reported a 99.3% median 2-qubit gate fidelity on its 9-qubit Ankaa-class processor. This high level of fidelity is crucial for reliable quantum computations and positions Rigetti well against competitors.\r\n\r\nThe market cap of RGTI is a fraction of IONQ\u2019s at just under 200 million at the time of writing. Its progress is similarly impressive, so it could hold significant upside and potentially mint a new generation of millionaires with a large enough investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We\u2019re still sitting ducks when it comes to cyberattacks, which creates an opportunity for some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nThe\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) just warned that attacks against water utilities are becoming more frequent and severe. They\u2019re also urging water systems to take immediate action to protect the nation\u2019s drinking water.\n\nIn Michigan,\u00a0pharmacies struggled to fill prescriptions because of a ransomware attacks on Ascension Rx retail pharmacies. Other attacks this year included a denial of service (DDoS) attacks on French state services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChange Healthcare is still reeling from an attack that\u2019s been called the \u201cbiggest ever cybersecurity attacks on the American healthcare system,\u201d\u00a0as noted by CBS News.\n\nIn 2022, the\u00a0global\u00a0cost of cybercrimes came in at $8.44 trillion,\u00a0according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the International Monetary Fund. By 2027, it could balloon to $23.84 trillion. Unfortunately, until governments, businesses, schools and your average person take these threats far more seriously, they\u2019ll continue to get worse.\n\nUntil the cybersecurity threat diminishes \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen any time soon \u2013 you may want to invest in some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy, such as:\n\nRadware (RDWR) internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecurity\n\nSource: Song_about_summer / Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned\u00a0Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR), it traded at $16.85 on April 29.\n\nAt the time, I noted it had\u00a0just launched a new artificial intelligence-powered Domain Name Service (DNS) Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack protection solution. Since that mention, the stock exploded to a high of $20.42.\n\nNow overbought at double-top resistance, I\u2019d wait for it to pull back first before buying more.\n\nHelping, the company just posted first quarter earnings per share of 16 cents, which beat by three cents. Revenue of $65.1 million \u2013 down 5.7% year over year \u2013 also beat by $1.53 million.\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we saw a recovery in customer spending, driven by a slight improvement in the business environment and a surge in cyber-attacks. Looking ahead to 2024, we intend to capitalize on the strong growth across our cloud security business and partner channels and the market need for best-in-class critical security. We believe we are well-positioned to return to revenue growth and improved profitability,\u201d\u00a0said Roy Zisapel, Radware\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nOversold shares of\u00a0Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) are pushing aggressively higher, too.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $260 in February, it\u2019s now up to $323.77. From here, I\u2019d like to see it initially refill its bearish gap at around $370. Earnings haven\u2019t been too shabby either. In its third quarter, EPS of $1.23 beat by seven cents. Revenue of $1.98 billion \u2013 up 15.1% year over year \u2013 beat by $10 million.\n\nMoving forward, the company expects fourth-quarter billings to range from $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, which is a year-over-year growth range of 9% to 10%. It also expects to see total revenue of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, as compared to estimates of $2.16 billion.\n\nJPMorgan just raised its price target on PANW to $340, with an overweight rating. KeyBanc also raised its price target to $384 with an overweight rating.\n\nEven better, Palo Alto and\u00a0IBM (NYSE:IBM) just partnered to develop and sell artificial intelligence-powered security solutions for the digital world.\n\nCyberArk (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter bottoming out at around $225,\u00a0CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is starting to pivot higher. It\u2019s also another one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy today.\n\nLast trading at $249.70, if it can break above its 50-day moving average, it could rally to $265 next. Helping, it just acquired\u00a0Venafi\u00a0from\u00a0Thoma Bravo\u00a0for $1.54 billion in cash.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition marks a pivotal milestone for CyberArk, enabling us to further our vision to secure every identity \u2013 human and machine \u2013 with the right level of privilege controls,\u201d\u00a0said Matt Cohen, Chief Executive Officer, CyberArk.\n\nCYBR earnings have also been impressive. In its first quarter, the company posted EPS of 75 cents, which beat by 48 cents. Revenue of $221.6 million \u2013 up 37% year over year \u2013 beat by $8.38 million. The subscription portion of its annual recurring revenue (ARR) jumped 54% to $621 million year over year. Even total ARR jumped 69% to $156.2 million.\n\nIt also raised its outlook on total revenue for the second quarter. It now expects total revenue to range from $215 million to $221 million, which is 22% to 26% growth. For the full-year, it expects for total revenue to range from $928 million to $938 million, or 23% to 25% growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "For forward-looking speculators, quantum computing stocks to buy should represent a priority. Why? It comes down to the industry\u2019s robust potential.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global quantum computing market reached a valuation of $885.4 million last year. By 2032, this sector could expand to $12.62 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.8%. That\u2019s not all.\n\nMcKinsey & Company noted that \u201c[q]uantum technology could create value worth trillions of dollars within the next decade.\u201d Enhancing everything from academic research to technology startups, the underlying qubits can completely change the game. With that in mind, below are three quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nOne of the biggest names in innovation, IBM (NYSE:IBM) technically falls under the information technology (IT) services arena. Per its public profile, the company known as \u201cBig Blue\u201d provides integrated solutions and services worldwide. Through its multiple segments, it offers a range of relevancies, from hybrid cloud to platforms focused on artificial intelligence. IBM\u2019s website states that it\u2019s attempting to deliver quantum-based utility to the world.\n\nFinancially, one of the benefits of targeting IBM as one of the quantum computing stocks to buy is consistency. In the past four quarters since the period ending March 31, 2024, the average positive earnings surprise has landed at 4.83%. That\u2019s not exciting but it demonstrates reliability.\n\nOver the trailing-12-month (TTM) period, IBM\u2019s net income stood at $8.15 billion. Revenue during this time hit $62.07 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts project earnings per share of $9.12 on revenue of $57.86 billion. While that\u2019s a bit disappointing, fiscal 2025 figures could see EPS rise to $9.58 on revenue of $60.52 billion.\n\nIn the meantime, don\u2019t forget the forward dividend yield of 3.93%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Mountain View, California, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is no stranger to innovation. Falling under the internet content and information space, that description doesn\u2019t do the company justice. With its subsidiaries, the company covers a range of tech-related sectors. As for quantum computing, its Google unit is busy developing hardware and software tools to push processes past classical computing limitations.\n\nWhile GOOGL isn\u2019t the most exciting idea for quantum computing stocks to buy, it\u2019s one of the most reliable enterprises. Since the first quarter going back to Q2 2023, the tech giant\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 10.68%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a TTM basis, the company posted net income of $82.41 billion on revenue of $318.15 billion. Its profit margin stands at a stout 25.9%. Looking out to the end of fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS will rise to $7.56 on revenue of $346.64 billion.\n\nLast year, Alphabet posted earnings of $5.80 per share on sales of $307.39 billion. With fiscal 2025\u2019s top line projected to hit $384.55 billion, GOOGL seems a solid bet for quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nArqit Quantum (ARQQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in London, U.K., Arqit Quantum (NASDAQ:ARQQ) is incredibly risky. Trading at a little over 40 cents a pop, ARQQ is liable for extreme volatility. At the same time, the idea represents one of the more tempting plays for quantum computing stocks to buy. Arqit provides advanced cybersecurity services, which may become exceptionally relevant. After all, quantum computers can create unbreakable software encryption keys.\n\nTo be sure, Arqit requires tremendous patience. Since the start of the year, shares lost more than 16% of equity value and that\u2019s not the worst of it. In the past 52 weeks, ARQQ suffered a decline of over 62%. You\u2019ve got to be aware of the risks.\n\nOn a TTM basis, Arqit posted a net loss of $73.91 million on modest revenue of $640,000. However, for fiscal 2024, analysts believe that the top line could skyrocket to $20.04 million. If so, that would represent a growth rate of nearly 2,792. For fiscal 2025, revenue could rise to $35.4 million. It\u2019s worth looking into if you wish to gamble.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Palo Alto's Conservative Approach Fails To Impress\n\nOn Monday, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) shares plunged upon its fiscal third quarter report that failed to impress due to a conservative guidance. Last week, Palo Alto Networks revealed it is buying cloud security software assets from International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) via a joint press release, also suggesting Palo Alto is in need of a power boost.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 30th, Palo Alto reported that revenue grew 15% YoY\u00a0to $1.98 billion.\u00a0Net income\u00a0amounted to\u00a0$278.8 million, or 79 cents a share, while adjusted earnings amounted to\u00a0$1.32\u00a0per share, surpassing\u00a0FactSet consensus\u00a0of\u00a0$1.25 a share.\n\nFiscal fourth quarter guidance that failed to impress.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto guided for revenue in the range from\u00a0$2.15 billion to $2.17 billion\u00a0with billings ranging from\u00a0$3.43 billion to $3.48 billion,\u00a0accounting for\u00a0deferred revenue.\n\nA Narrowed Down Full Year Guidance\n\nPalo Alto did not lift the outlook it provided in February, just narrowed it down. For the\u00a0full-year, Palo Alto guided for bookings between\u00a0$10.13 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$10.18 billion\u00a0while it previously expected them to come in between\u00a0$10.1 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$10.2 billion. Palo Alto guided for revenue in the range between\u00a0$7.99 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$8.01 billion, narrowing down its prior range between\u00a0$7.95 billion to $8.00 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Enlists Help From IBM\n\nAs part of a broader partnership, IBM will provide the cybersecurity company access to more consultants and a bigger customer base.\u00a0Palo Alto is acquiring\u00a0the\u00a0QRadar cloud software\u00a0from IBM\u00a0for an undisclosed sum, as well as\u00a0migrating existing customers to its security platform, Cortex Xsiam. In addition,\u00a0IBM will train more than 1,000 of its consulting employees on Palo Alto\u2019s products.\u00a0This strategic alliance between IBM and Palo Alto Networks reflects the current consolidation trend in the\u00a0security software industry as companies join forces to get ready for the future attacks that will be empowered by AI.\u00a0Palo Alto is growing much faster than IBM\u00a0so IBM is also getting a needed boost through this alliance.\u00a0IBM CEO\u00a0Arvind Krishna\n\nExpects that IBM is\u00a0going to\u00a0generate\u00a0significant consulting business\u00a0growth\u00a0on Palo Alto\u2019s products,\u00a0much like with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)\u00a0Azure and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:\u00a0AWS) as IBM\u00a0helps organizations run their software on the\u00a0public clouds from both\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsolidations are in the security software industry\u2019s air.\n\nFor example, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) snapped up the leading provider of\u00a0security information and event management\u00a0(SIEM) software. Cisco wrapped up its biggest ever $28 billion acquisition earlier in March. Although the SIEM category has been around for more than two decades, Palo Alto just introduced Cortex Xsiam two years ago.\u00a0Cortex Xsiam\u2019s adoption has been rapid and\u00a0Nikesh Arora, CEO\u00a0of Palo Alto Networks also added it has been taking market share from \u201ceverone\u201d.\n\nPalo Alto former CEO acknowledges the company does not use the most sophisticated AI.\n\nIn a climate where \u2018best of breed\u2019 solutions are demanded,\u00a0prioritizing quality, former CEO, Lane\u00a0Bess emphasized Palo Alto\u2019s ability to effectively defend against cyberattacks while acknowledging it does not use the most sophisticated AI. This is why the security alliance with IBM to jointly provide AI-powered offerings comes at a good time for the company to deliver on its promise of unleashing the power of AI to take cybersecurity to the next level.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $2.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 points to a change of +3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.32 indicates a change of +4.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.04 billion and $66.08 billion estimates indicate +1.9% and +4.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I hope everybody enjoyed our new marketing campaign teaser featuring Keanu Reeves that goes live on national media.\r\nLet's start at the beginning. I'll update you on what we have experienced in Q3. First and foremost, cyberattacks continue unabated. We're seeing a consistent stream of nation-state activity that is systematically looking for software supply chain and hardware zero day vulnerabilities and attempting to exploit them at scale. Additionally, there continues to be a robust stream of attack activity targeted at large enterprises and pieces of critical infrastructure.\r\nWe continue to see high-profile breaches, some of which were widely reported in the press again this quarter. Most organizations faced the challenge of an ever shrinking time window for a bad actor to enter their environments, find valuable data and exfiltrate it. The window is now measured in hours. In comparison, the time it takes for an organization to discover a breach and stop the malicious activity continues to be measured in days and weeks. While not a new phenomena, with new disclosure mandates, this challenge is now clearly out in the open. With AI, we expect the attacks to come at an even faster pace.\r\nI don't need to elaborate on the current enthusiasm around AI. Almost every one of our customers is either experimenting with AI or plans to deploy some use cases in the near future. As usual, their employees are way ahead. Almost 50% of employees of most companies are using some sort of AI application, LLM or copilot to explore, learn and make themselves more productive.\r\nWhilst this is great for the evolution and adoption of AI, this is introducing a whole new set of threats. As some of you are aware, we have recently announced a suite of products, which are aimed to secure this AI usage by design. More about this later, but I expect this to continue to provide a tailwind to the cybersecurity industry.\r\nOn spending for cybersecurity, we see no changes, pace or trajectory. Most customers have a series of projects they want to get done, and the only limiting factor seems to be their execution capability. Customers continue to focus on Zero Trust transformations, coupled with the need for new network architectures to adapt to a more hybrid infrastructure.\r\nThe insurgence of cloud migrations is being driven by the need to get their data in the cloud to be AI ready causing discussions around the cloud security platform. And as you may all have noticed with all the M&A activity, the security operations space is getting rejuvenated, is something we've been preparing for with XSIAM.\r\nThe accelerated pace of change in cyber, even with healthy increase in cybersecurity funding, many organizations aim to simply keep pace with the volume of threat activity they see. Most cannot do this and are increasingly receptive to a better way of tracking their security challenges -- tackling their security challenges, [windless sprawl] and architectural complexity. We firmly believe that answer is platformization of cybersecurity over time.\r\nI'm delighted to report, despite the concerns around our platformization approach after our last quarter, the customer feedback has been nothing but encouraging. We have initiated way more conversations in our platformization than we expected. If meetings were a measure of outcome, they have gone up 30%, and a majority of them have been centered on platform opportunities. In short, demand is robust, and my expectation is that we will continue to see it be that way for the next many quarters. With this backdrop, we are pleased with our strong Q3 results. \r\nAs you can see, we delivered top line growth ahead of the market and continue to drive growth while improving profitability. Our performance was highlighted by 47% growth in our next-generation security ARR. As we continue to transform our business to a security software business, and we saw a 23% growth in RPO, an uptick from last quarter, this translated into 15% revenue growth and 3% growth in our billings.\r\nAs we have articulated earlier, we don't see the billing metric as a true indicator of business trend. It continues to be impacted by payment terms where more and more customers prefer annual billing plans. However, if you implied bookings, you will note that we saw an uptick over that in the last -- over the last 2 quarters. We actually ended up billing -- booking backlog -- billing backlog this quarter.\r\nWe continue to operate our business efficiently. Our operating margins expanded by 200 basis points year-over-year, driving 25% growth in operating income and 20% in our EPS to $1.32. Our cash generation was strong, and again, our GAAP net income grew substantially year-over-year.\r\nBefore I continue with highlights from Q3, I'm aware that our accelerated consolidation and platformization strategy created significant conversation last quarter. We also had questions from analysts and investors on this topic since we reported our Q2 results in February. I thought I'd share more background on how we got here to provide context and also offer a platformization framework for you to help understand why we are convinced that we can build a much larger business over the next several years and platformization is key to achieving that.\r\nWhen we embarked on our journey to transform our company, we were keen to create interest and convince our customers that if we solve their problems, not just with our next-generation firewalls and the associated subscriptions but also with a set of best-of-breed products across 20-plus categories organized across 3 platforms. That strategy was hugely successful and saw us achieving nearly $4 billion in NGS ARR. The majority of focus of our teams was landing multiple products across our [3] platforms and our customers. Whether we were able to land at a brand-new customer for Palo Alto Networks or we added products from new platforms to our existing customers, we were happy. Landing could range from a single product use in part of the organization to broader usage across the organization.\r\nFrom that lens, if you look at our top 5,000 customers, we have landed 2 or more of our platforms at about half these customers, and these customers contribute just over 80% of NGS ARR. If you look at it by -- this by platform, we have landed 97% of these top 5,000 network security, over 20% of them in Prisma Cloud and over 40% with Cortex. By all means, our land the platform strategy was extremely successful. \r\nIn landing with multiple platforms, many of our customers have leveraged our capabilities across key cybersecurity buying centers such as network security, cloud security and security ops. Most of this cross-platform adoption has happened more organically with customers adopting incremental products on Palo Alto Networks on their own pace. Governed by the complexity of their environment and the friction of dealing with contracts and multiple vendors, not many of our landed customers are fully platformized; and the ones that are fully platformized, we saw encouraging results.\r\nWe realized that for fully platformized customers, while they saw better security outcomes, our ARR profile was also very different. While our average next-generation security ARR for our landed customers ranges from $200,000 to $300,000 for our land strategy, we discovered that our ARR for fully platformized customers ranges from $2 million to $14 million, depending on how many platforms the customers are standardizing on. This drove us to accelerate the rollout of our platformization strategy at the end of the last quarter, following successful pilots earlier in the year. We've created interest in the market, started conversation with customers looking to begin their platformization journey and spurring existing sales cycles toward a more strategic outcome.\r\nHaving personally reviewed over 500 of our top customers in detail this past quarter, having had a few hundred conversations with CISOs, CIOs and CEOs, I continue to be convinced of our opportunity to deliver full platformization to our strong -- to our top customers. We're still early in the results from full platformization. Across these top 5,000 customers, we have completed about 900 through Q3 2024. Our Q3 efforts resulted in approximately 65 incremental platformization sales in Q3, just up 40% since Q2.\r\nIt was this framework that was a foundation for our goal of $15 billion in next-generation security ARR by fiscal year 2030 that we first discussed last quarter. With our incremental momentum in platformization, we see a runway to delivering approximately 2,500 plus platformization sales, up from the current 900 while continuing to land our multiple platforms in our customer base and adding new customers.\r\nI showed you the benefits we see in our ARR from our success driving platformization. Our customers also see significant benefits as they adopt our full platforms. We have talked to you in the past about reduction in median time to resolution with XSIAM, which takes less than 1/10 of the time it took before XSIAM was deployed as customers platformize on Cortex.\r\nIDC recently validated the benefits platform customers see in a study published earlier this year, independently proving much of what we have talked about. Customers saw productivity benefits as much as 30% to 40% efficiency improvements and significant improvements in security outcomes.\r\nI could talk further about the benefits, but what really brings us to the forefront is some examples of our significant transactions in Q3. A U.S. county agency signed a 7-figure transaction landing our firewall subscriptions as well as Cortex XDR and becoming a Palo Alto customer for the first time. We displaced a competitor that has sold both of these capabilities to the customer and competed against us on an appliance vendor that could not offer best-of-breed capabilities across these 2 categories.\r\nA large U.S. financial services company that was an existing platform customer faced significant challenges in their SOC. Despite a staff of 40 in the SOC, they were not achieving their goals and start a transformation plan. We signed an 8-figure deal, including XSIAM, our ITDR or identity threat detection and response offering, and our managed detection and response service.\r\nA global data services provider was unhappy with this incumbent SASE provider facing outages that created lost productivity. He was also never able to integrate his VPN and URL filtering capabilities fully. The customer selected our SASE capability for approximately 65,000 mobile and branch office users, including CASB, DLP, enterprise browser and ADEM capabilities for many of them. This was a highly competitive situation, but our ability to deliver consolidated capabilities through a platform across a half a dozen areas as well as our superior security versus incumbent won us a business.\r\nFinally, a large health care company experienced a breach and engaged our Unit 42 incident response services. After we helped the customer remediate and get back online, we were able to educate the customer on the benefits of platformization. The customer fully platformized with us, standardizing our network security, Prisma Cloud and Cortex. This transaction was the largest in the history of Palo Alto Networks at nearly $150 million of TCV. Beyond these showcase deals, our overall large deal activity was healthy in Q3, as shown by significant increase in our accounts and transactions over $1 million, $5 million and $10 million in the quarter. \r\nWe also recently announced our partnership with IBM. IBM and Palo Alto Networks have done what in my mind is a one-of-a-kind partnership. This partnership involves migrating the QRadar customers of IBM to XSIAM, where IBM will be able to deliver industry-specific capabilities on XSIAM using watsonx. Given their leadership position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, now we can collectively deliver an even better solution to both their existing and new customers.\r\nEnabling over 1,000 IBM security consultants on the entire Palo Alto Networks portfolio will allow us to drive platformization in an accelerated fashion. We will be IBM's preferred cybersecurity partner across network, cloud and SOC while driving a significant book of business for IBM. Additionally, IBM will platformize on Palo Alto products. We will extensively leverage watsonx across both our operations and products. And lastly, but not the least, we will work on co-developing solutions for cloud security.\r\nLast quarter, when we rolled out our accelerated consolidation and platformization strategy, we also activated our AI leadership strategy. Leading up to this over the last year, we've oriented an increasing portion of our R&D investments towards AI. We have seen growth in customer interest and adopting AI to drive business value and bad actors using AI as I discussed earlier.\r\nIn early May, we announced our comprehensive suite of AI security offerings and believe we will be first to market with capabilities to protect the range of our customers' AI security needs. We rolled out 3 products to safely enable the use of AI from employees using AI to enterprises building into their applications. AI Access Security, AI-SPM and AI Runtime Security put us at the forefront of securing AI adoption.\r\nWe also believe our co-pilots across our 3 platforms, which are context-aware, can perform and automate user action, surface alerts and best practices, and provide in-product support, all with near perfect accuracy. Furthermore, we announced our Precision AI security bundle to leverage in-line AI to counter AI attacks with AI defense. We have had strong early customer engagement with these offerings, which we expect to be made generally available beginning of July. As you heard from our teaser trailer with Keanu, this isn't Sci-Fi. This is Precision AI.\r\nMore broadly than AI, it has been a busy last 3 months from an innovation perspective. Our SASE 3.0 launch, which we rolled out early this month, debuted with several unique industry defining capabilities. We announced industry's only secure enterprise browser integrated into SASE; and as end user engagement with AI applications grow, the browser becomes an important defense layer against the AI threats. Additionally, it is becoming clear that the browser offers a better way to secure contractors, mobile devices and managed devices with SASE integration providing a simpler and more secure approach to adoption.\r\nWe launched AI powered data security integrated into SASE, leveraging industry's first LLM powered data classification. This new classification engine combines the strength of context-aware machine learning model, the power of LLMs, understanding how to increase classification accuracy. Lastly, as part of our SASE 3.0, we launched application acceleration, which understands each user's journey within enterprise SaaS and cloud applications and optimize its performance for these applications. Customers see performance up to 5x faster than the user experience in general Internet. \r\nThis rapid cadence of innovation in SASE has enabled us to maintain SASE ARR growth above 50% for the sixth quarter in a row. In Prisma Cloud, we have completed the first phase of rollout of data security posture management, which came from the Dig Security acquisition. We also added support for more than 100 new APIs across the major hyperscalers to stay ahead of our customers by securing the cloud services [iota]. Based on our Cortex Xpanse technology, we did launch cloud discovery and exposure management, leveraging our Xpanse data natively in Prisma Cloud. Over 100 customers now use this capability to evaluate Internet exposure risks and discover unknown Internet-exposed cloud assets.\r\nAlso during Q3, we launched CDR, cloud detection and response, which extends our XDR capability into the cloud and give customers unified view of their entire environment from cloud to end point to network. CDEM and CDR show the power of having both Cortex and Prisma Cloud platforms as we can leverage these sophisticated capabilities to benefit cloud customers.\r\nLast but not least, on Cortex, we launched XSIAM about 18 months ago, and this offering has already elevated the profile of Cortex in the market. We see steady demand for XDR as a foundation of Cortex, where we are landing many new customers, and now we have north of 5,800 customers on XDR. With $400 million in cumulative XSIAM bookings coming out of Q3, this offering is really going mainstream with customers understanding the value proposition versus the traditional SIEM. XSIAM has accelerated our Cortex ARR growth, and we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities.\r\nWe are converting our innovation recognized leadership, adding 2 new positions this quarter: one was in managed detection and response; the other in data security posture management, leveraging our Dig acquisition and demonstrating our ability to acquire technology and rapidly integrate into our platforms.\r\nAs many of you have undoubtedly seen, our rollout of platformization has stoked a long-standing debate within the cybersecurity industry about whether customers desire a platform or best-of-breed cybersecurity. From the Palo Alto Networks perspective, we've proven it is possible to deliver best of platform. This is why we have invested in building leading products, and we have now recognition for product leadership in 23 categories while also delivering on the benefits of integration across our 3 platforms.\r\nTo summarize, before I pass off to Dipak, please take away a few conclusions from my prepared remarks. One, we put our strong Q3 results in a positive spending environment where cybersecurity priorities are well funded. Beyond the continuation of a challenging threat environment, new threat vectors from AI are starting to surface as the usage of AI grows. We've been pleased with the initial traction of our accelerated consolidation platform strategy. This drove an increase in bookings with deferred payments and impacted our billings, something we expect will continue. We had a big quarter of innovation, especially as it relates to AI, where we strive to lead the industry in securing this powerful productivity medium while also doing so comprehensively.\r\nAs we look forward, we have significant pipeline heading into our largest quarter of the year. We're just beginning to see the benefits of platformization accrue to our business. We will continue to make further investments here while balancing delivering profitable growth and have chartered a path with conviction towards being a $15 billion NGS ARR company.\r\nWith that, let me pass you on to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide highlights and you can review results available in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website. Within our revenue of $1.98 billion, product revenue grew 1%, while total service revenue grew 20%. Within services revenue, subscription revenue grew 25% and support revenue grew 11%.\r\nMoving on to geographies. We saw revenue growth across all theaters with the Americas growing 15%, EMEA up 20% and JAPAC growing 8%. This quarter, our lower JAPAC revenue growth was driven by lower product bookings in the region, offset by higher subscription bookings, which benefit revenue over time.\r\nWe reported Q3 billings within the range we guided, although as Nikesh and I have noted several times in the past few quarters, we continue to focus less on this metric. We saw an increase quarter-over-quarter in business transacted with deferred billings, which was also higher than we forecasted. The impact on our financials from platformization this quarter was in line with what we expected 90 days ago, and our expectations around the impact in Q4 and beyond is unchanged from what we talked about in February.\r\nFirst, we saw a greater volume of large deals with some of these customers opting for deferred payments over the term of their purchase instead of paying upfront as they grapple with the higher cost of money. This drove the quarter-to-quarter increase in periodic billing plans that I noted. Also, this level of periodic billings was higher than we forecasted 90 days ago. We also saw an uptick in the array of our platformization programs we launched early in the quarter. These programs continue to ramp up as we roll them out broadly.\r\nWithin our RPO of $11.3 billion, our current RPO was $5.4 billion. Our average duration of new contracts increased slightly year-over-year but remained at approximately 3 years. On our balance sheet, you will see that our debt balance came down by $659 million. The driver for this was early conversion, which occurred at the option of the debt holders and were settled by us in cash. Our remaining debt matures in June 2025 although we may continue to see early conversions. \r\nDuring Q3, we spent $500 million to repurchase 1.7 million shares of our common stock. Our buyback strategy remains opportunistic.\r\nI know that billings has been a significant focus for investors. As you're all aware, remaining performance obligation or RPO captures the full value of our contracts independent of customer billing terms. As we have explained to you over the last year, with an increase in factors impacting payment terms on a quarterly basis, there's been significant volatility in our billings. With this volatility in mind, we've been increasingly focused on driving high-quality bookings, which add to RPO and maximize our NGS ARR in contracts. Focuses on these metrics provides a more relevant view of the business.\r\nIf we look at the history of these metrics for our company, you see that NGS ARR has consistently grown ahead of our other metrics and as it continues to contribute a higher proportion of our revenue. You also see the correlation between RPO and total services revenue growth is high. Our RPO is mainly comprised of contracts for offerings that carry ratable revenue, which are recognized through our total services revenue. Billings, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the invoicing terms on contract signed, which adds significant volatility. In Q3, we saw RPO growth tick up along with strength in NGS ARR, including us raising our guidance here. This is in contrast to billing trends, which went the other direction, thereby showing the divergent trends and actions -- in action, our Q3 results.\r\nNikesh talked briefly about our first-of-a-kind IBM partnership that has multiple facets that touch each of our platforms and include significant devotion of resources from both companies. I'd like to provide more details on the financial impact we expect to see. As part of the partnership, we have agreed to acquire IBM's QRadar SaaS assets, certain QRadar intellectual property and IBM's on-premise QRadar customer list. The total consideration is $500 million plus earn-out consideration based on successfully migrating QRadar on-premise customers to our XSIAM offering over the next several years. We anticipate closing the transaction by the end of September 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The calendar year 2023 QRadar SaaS revenue was on the order of $100 million. However, as we work through details of the customer contracts we are acquiring and the deferred revenue associated with this business, we expect our recognized revenue could be much lower than this in our fiscal year 2025. \r\nWe will provide more information on the financial impact closer to the close of the transaction. We will invest to fuel this partnership and ensure a seamless experience to curate our customers purchasing and migrating to XSIAM. As part of the partnership, we have entered into an agreement with IBM, whereby they will operate parts of the business on our behalf on a medium-term basis. We expect we can make these investments within the profitability framework we spoke of previously. Specifically, we continue to expect 28% to 29% non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year 2026 and 37% or greater free cash flow margin through fiscal year 2026.\r\nBefore I provide Q4 guidance, I wanted to remind you of what we talked last quarter when we introduced platformization and discussed the top line headwinds we expected it would have. We continue to expect platformization-related drivers, both larger deals with associated cost of money impacts and acceleration in platformization programs will impact our billings over a total of a 12- to 18-month period.\r\nConsistent with what we noted in February, we expect that this will persist through fiscal year '25 as we anniversary the rollout of these programs and resulting in lower billings and to a lesser degree, revenue. Beyond this period, we expect to grow faster than we discussed in August and sustain this growth for longer.\r\nNow moving on to our guidance for Q4 and the year. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, an increase of 9% to 10%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.42 a share, a decrease of 1% to 3%.\r\nFor the fiscal year '24, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.13 billion to $1.18 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $4.05 billion to $4.10 billion, an increase of 37% to 39%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.99 billion to $8.01 billion, an increase of 16%. For fiscal '24, we expect operating margins to be in the range of 26.8% to 27.0%, an increase of 270 to 290 basis points year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.58 per share, an increase of 25% to 26%. And we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 38.5% to 39%. \r\nIn the interest of time and to get as many of your questions as possible, we've included the modeling points in the appendix of our earnings presentation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\n(Operator Instructions) The first question will be from Brian Essex at JPMorgan, followed by Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Brian. Brian, looks like you're on mute.\n\nBrian Lee Essex\n\nThere we go. Yes, it wasn't letting me unmute myself. Yes, I guess for Dipak, as we look at your efforts of incentivizing platform consolidation or platformization, I mean, obviously, you've talked about the pressure on the last 2 quarters of this year, can you maybe help me understand the duration that you anticipate pursuing these efforts? Is this going to be a more temporary type of effort where it kind of just lasts through this fiscal year? Or do you expect it to stretch into next year?\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nYes. So thanks for the question, Brian. Look, I think we will -- I mean platformization is something that is now our strategy, so I think in that sense, it will continue for a while. But at some point, it just becomes a normal motion, and then we're lapping a period where we've been doing platformization already. So really, what you're seeing in the financial metrics is the difference when it wasn't the normal motion and then it becomes the motion, and then in the future, it will just become lapping what is a consistent motion.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI think in that context, we said last quarter that this should persist still the end of Q2 next year. We kind of started Q2 this year.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question is from Brad Zelnick, followed by Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead Brad.\n\nBrad Alan Zelnick\n\nNikesh, I was hoping you can give us an update on the state of the channel. There's a lot of noise from the traditional VAR channel. Wanted to get your sense on how they're acclimating to platformization. But you're also doubling down with the GSIs. You announced this super special deal with IBM. You also signed a deal with Accenture, too. Would just love to hear your latest thinking, in particular, more on the GSI strategy. I mean how many more can you add that are up at that level of an Accenture and an IBM?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nWell, first of all, thanks for the question. Look, I don't think there is contention between the 2 channels. We still do IBM deals with a traditional VAR involved. Very often, the VAR has -- represents the customer, helps to clear the deals, helps them work through all the financing, et cetera. So there is a role for both. What we are discovering is, in platformization deals, customers require consulting effort to re-architect the entire security stack. And typically, they engage with the SI community or GSI community first to try and do that transformation. And partnering with them hand in glove allows us to be part of that story.\r\nAnd I gave the example when we did the most recent, let's just say, re-architecture, which we had to do in a hurry in the case of the recent hack, we were working with SI partners as well as other incident response teams to make sure that we build an architecture that's consistent with what the end state needs to be. And that's where partnerships like Accenture and IBM become really worthy and important because the customer is relying on them to do the heavy lift in doing the onetime transformation.\r\nSo I think both these strategies will coexist. As you know, we still have a substantive hardware business, which we also work through the traditional channel. We also have -- actually, to be fair, many of the VARs have transferred or translated their businesses into a part consulting model, where they also work with customers on transformations. So I don't think they're intentional. I think it becomes harder for the analyst community to be able to track what the channel status of a company is because the SIs are not as sharing as the traditional VAR channel is.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext, we'll go to Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley, followed by Matt Hedberg from RBC.\n\nHamza Fodderwala\n\nNikesh, in the earnings presentation, you mentioned you see significant pipeline heading into your fiscal Q4. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color into that pipeline because the Q4 billings guide does suggest a big sequential uptick as is usual, but I think this year, a little bit higher than normal. But any color you can give would be helpful.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes. Hamza, look, first, thanks for the question. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have been reviewing all of our customers. We have been through 500 of them with the accountant teams. And every customer, there is an opportunity. There's an opportunity to deliver a platform. There's an opportunity to consolidate. And just that gives us hope and sort of some degree of conviction that there's a lot of business to be converted out there. It's really limited by the customer speed and desire to execute or their resources to execute. So we have a robust pipeline across most of our platforms to see questions, can we go out and convert as quickly as we need to, and that's what we're guiding to.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question is from Matt Hedberg followed by Tal Liani from Bank of America.\n\nMatthew George Hedberg\n\nI wanted to ask about the federal side. Last quarter, you mentioned Thunderdome. Any update on that transaction and just kind of how we're thinking about federal into 3Q -- or excuse me, your 4Q?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes, that's a good question. Look, the Thunderdome contract got activated last quarter because of the sort of the zero-day vulnerability we found in certain VPNs out in the market. So they wanted to quickly replace some of the VPNs because they're required to replace them in the classified agencies and nonclassified agencies. So we saw some activity around Thunderdome. That contract was activated where people use that contract that we have with DISA to be able to execute some transactions, but we still maintain these are going to get one at a time. Each of these missions are going to execute one at a time. So we haven't changed our expectations in terms of how Thunderdome will evolve vis-a-vis how we will see it in our financials.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question from Tal Liani at Bank of America followed by Saket Kalia at Barclays.\n\nTal Liani\n\nI know we don't focus on billings, but I have a question. Just first, to clarify -- just to clarify, you -- if you won -- you said in the prepared remarks, you won a $150 million deal. Does it include -- does it go through billing? And should we exclude it from billing on a normalized level, just to understand the impact on billings this quarter? And then billing is -- it's going to recover because I -- or I'm going to ask it, not say it. But how -- what's the path for recovery for billing? If investors are looking at it and you look out into the next year or 2 years, what's the path to recovery of billings growth?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nTal, I think if you listen carefully to what I said, we actually built backlog this quarter, which means we booked a lot more business than we build, which is a difference between contracts where we chose not to take their payment terms and just do annual billing. So we're signing big deals. We have a lot of business that we're signing, and the way it gets reflected is in RPO.\r\nIt depends on what we choose to either take as annual billings or to take through PANFS, right, which shows up in billings. What we choose not to take ends up in future or deferred payment plans or deferred billing. So I think if you look at the implied bookings, you'll see there's a double-digit number in there in the quarter.\r\nI just think billing is an artificial metric. I think -- I understand you guys like it because it's been around for a long time. I think the cost of money has changed the quality of that metric. To me, a quality metric is implied bookings or RPO. And in both those, as I mentioned, we saw an uptick this quarter. So we actually believe we saw a recovery faster than we expected this quarter. That's why we're surprised at the reaction of the market.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext up is Saket Kalia from Barclays followed by Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nNikesh, maybe the follow-up is on that point. So just to that point, it was great to see RPO bookings, I think, actually accelerated year-over-year in this quarter, right? So last quarter, I think we talked about more flexibility for customers with platformization, right, just consolidating and creating some of those ramp contracts. How much of that -- how much did that sort of play into the difference between bookings and billings.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nWell, remember, the acceleration -- the ramp contracts really impact us in the way that we have higher exit ARRs in many of our newer contracts, right? So the year 1 ARR may be lower than the year 3 ARR for a contract. But that is not visible to you yet in the numbers because there's no way to represent that, right? The only way you'll see it, you'll see it in a consolidated TCV deal, which is going to show up in RPO. So the ramp contracts show was a total whole sum in the RPO number and you'll see an uptick in the ARPU number, which tells you that business is stronger this quarter than we expected it to be.\r\nI think the only difference is we chose not to take -- remember, when a customer says I don't want to pay you up front, you have 2 choices. You can take annual billings or you can get them financing through PANFS, right, where it takes away from revenue and becomes interest income. And then we decided we didn't want to take so many of these deals, so our quantum of deferred billing went up compared to last quarter.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question, Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs, followed by Gray Powell from BTIG. Go ahead, Gabriela.\n\nGabriela Borges\n\nI want to ask on the $15 billion NGS target for fiscal year '30. Either for Nikesh and Dipak, a little bit of color on how you arrived at that number. There's an interesting footnote here on assuming 5% annual growth per customer. And then within that target, how do you think about cyclicality? Any comments on the cyclicality of firewall or the cyclicality of platformization impacting the linearity of getting to that target.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes, 2 things. One, the firewall is not in there. That's hardware. That's not next-generation security. The services that work on top of firewalls are obviously in there because they're all now AI enabled and next generation. Cyclicality is consistent with our cyclicality of our quarters, right? We see more business in Q4. You should expect more platformization deals in Q4, hopefully, higher growth in NGS ARR, which you are used to. I think the cyclicality of that slide is no different than the cyclicality you've seen in the growth of NGS ARR over the last 3 years. We have been sharing that number with you. \r\nYes. Sorry, was there another part to that?\n\nGabriela Borges\n\nYes. Just on the footnote here on the 5% within -- yes, benchmark that for us.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nWell, what we discovered is as platformization grows for a customer, as renewals come up, we're able to upsell them more capability. For example, in SASE, now we can sell them ADEM and AIOps. For example, on our firewalls, we can send them 10 subscriptions. For example, in Cortex now with XDR, ITDR, we can sell them CDR. In access, we will be able to sell the AI Access. So every time these deals will come up for renewals, we will have the opportunity to present more services and capability onto the platform with a customer driving NRR for us, so we've made a simplistic assumption that the combined effect of NRR is approximately a 5% increase in ARR over the course of those years.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question, Gray Powell from BTIG, followed by Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\n\nGray Wilson Powell\n\nIt was good to hear the 50% growth on Prisma SASE this quarter. So a question on secure service edge. If I look at industry analysts' estimates there, I think secure service edge is probably about 25% of the network security market today give or take. That's rough. I'm just kind of curious like where do you think that penetration goes in maybe 3 or 4 years. Or maybe said differently, how should we think about the growth profile of that market going forward and your ability to grow at or above that?\n\nLee Klarich\n\nYes. Look, I think it's important to start with a view on this, that the market will be hybrid for a very long time, meaning customers will need a combination of hardware form factors, software form factors and SASE. And the reason for that is campuses still exist and hardware is still the fastest approach to this. And public and private cloud, software-based approaches are the best. SASE comes in with all of the remote users and branch offices. And so the -- that hybrid nature, from our perspective, means that the customers will increasingly choose to go with a platform-based approach where they can shift traffic across those different form factors as is optimized for that form factor.\r\nAnd so some of the SASE growth that you've seen and you've seen it with us, we're 50% growth with SASE over the last several quarters, is showing that, that portion of the architecture is going to grow faster for some time and then ultimately, see this come into the total growth of the platform being what really matters. And then on top of that, we can deliver the security services, such as the newly announced AI Access Security across all of those form factors.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext up, Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho, followed by Fatima Boolani from Citi.\n\nGregg Steven Moskowitz\n\nNikesh, in order to reach your fiscal '30 goals, it looks like you'll need to sign an average, give or take, of around 75 new platformization deals per quarter, a little higher than what you did -- just did in Q3. But if we're in the early days of this strategy and if you're just now building your go-to-market muscle around this, why shouldn't new platformization customers be a lot higher than that on a multiyear basis?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nLook, we told you last quarter we're going to do platformization. I have to say, I have to commend our team. We spent a lot of time over the last 90 days working hard on analyzing all this data to make sure we could give you a framework, so you can look at it and measure us over the next few quarters as we show you the benefits of platformization. So that's one part.\r\nThe other part is, look, it's positively surprise, a good thing that we've got 60-plus deals done in this quarter. We'll see what happens in Q4. We've just started going down this journey, and of course, if prospects get better, we will be happy to update our targets in the future. But for now, that seems like a robust goal that will still make us the first company in the history of cybersecurity to ever get ever close to that kind of aspirational number.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext up, Fatima Boolani from Citi, followed by Shaul Eyal from Cowen.\n\nFatima Aslam Boolani\n\nNikesh, you talked a lot about the multiplicative impact and the monetization acceleration you can get from platformization. I'm curious if we can put a profitability lens on this because you are driving between $2 million and $14 million of ARR, you mentioned, from a platformized customer. But from a contribution margin perspective, can you share with us what that incremental profitability impact would be like? And why should we sitting here not think that structurally your business, as it moves towards being increasingly consolidated, can see 30%, 35%, maybe even 40% operating margins?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes. Look, Fatima, I -- in concept, principally, I have no argument against what you're saying because, remember, if you look at an average enterprise company's P&L, the largest cost is sales and marketing, right? Gross margins are, give or take, 75% to 80%. Take your favorite enterprise company. That leaves you most of your costs are -- majority of the costs are sales and marketing. If you can consolidate and concentrate your sales and marketing costs to very large deals and be able to generate large amounts of ARR or ACV/TCV from those customers, the cost of sales as a proportion of your revenue goes down. As you are constantly upselling it to the same customer base, it also makes it a little easier.\r\nSo I think we -- our opportunity is to, first, create enough breadth in our sort of coverage to make sure that we can actually go address all these landed customers. We've only done 900. We said we got to get north of 2,500, which means we have to go address a lot more customers on our existing landed base. We don't have to go make new friends. We just have to go work with our existing friends. But yes, in the long term, I have no argument against your thesis that this should allow us to continue to aspire to higher profitability, not counting the impact of AI, which should get us to be a much more productive organization over the medium term.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question Shaul Eyal from Cowen, followed by Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo.\n\nShaul Eyal\n\nQuestion for Dipak or Nikesh on finance receivables. So finance receivables, up 34% sequentially. I know you don't guide, cannot guide this metric. If we look into next quarter and take into account your commentary about the strong pipeline, will we be seeing the finance receivables still expanding? Or maybe asked differently, will there be a point where would you like to see like this metric actually decelerating to a degree? What's the thinking along these lines?\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nYes. So I think -- thanks for the question, Shaul. I think as the business grows, like having tools like PANFS can only help you. And if that's what the customer is looking for in terms of deferred payment plans, I think I don't have a problem if it goes up because it just ends up giving you even more like knowledge of what your cash flow will be in the future, like -- so all of that receivable, we collect it eventually.\r\nHonestly, I think more of it is related to the cost of money than anything else. So I think this becomes a larger issue in the current environment where interest rates are higher. I think if we're in an environment where the interest rates will go down, that's when I would expect this to potentially ratchet down.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext up is Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo, followed by Joe Gallo from Jefferies.\n\nAndrew James Nowinski\n\nSo I wanted to ask you about the IBM deal. What was the impetus for acquiring those assets? Because it looks like their SaaS revenue is pretty small at $100 million. And given how well XSIAM is doing, couldn't you just capture those on-prem customers for free over time?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI think, Andrew, there's more than that. Remember, we explained to you that part of platformization is going to be able to transition customers off their existing contracts. Now the good news is we can transition these customers irrespective of term when they expire. That's great option value, right? I don't have to wait for 3 years to migrate them. I don't have to wait for an RFP. I can just walk up to them saying, \"Listen, you're already my customer now because I've acquired the contract. Why don't you come? We work on transitioning you to XSIAM.\" Not only that, it also allows the opportunity not just to go after the SaaS customer base but also allows us to transition the on-prem customer base, which is a much larger prize, where IBM has economics from us where they're able to -- they will get earn-out based on how many of those customers transition to us.\r\nSo I mean, honestly, it's -- I think it's an amazing deal for us. I'm just delighted that IBM agreed to do this deal with us and partner with us and also gives me access to -- look, in the history of IBM, they have not sold anybody else's cybersecurity portfolio with the enthusiasm we hope we can generate together with 1,000 cybersecurity sellers. Until now, they would sell one portfolio that was IBM. And today, we -- this deal allows us to train all of them, all 1,000 of them, work with them on XSIAM and get it out to customers.\r\nJust I think it's -- hopefully cements our place in the SIEM/SOC category at a pace that nobody would have anticipated, right? Until yesterday, there were 3 players in the Magic Quadrant, which was not us. This allows us to participate with one of the biggest players in the space and migrate as many of these customers based on merit and based on great proposition as quickly as we can. That [$5] million, I didn't have to spend -- what's the number? Never mind, I won't quote a large number. I didn't have to sell many, many, many billions of dollars and transition the customers then.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext up, Joe Gallo from Jefferies, followed by Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research.\n\nJoseph Anthony Gallo\n\nI want to follow up on Fatima's question. I don't think many disagree with the strategic long-term potential of the platform or the ensuing financial strength. But when you look at fiscal '25 specifically and free cash flow being 37% plus margin there, how should we think about the visibility or durability of that free cash flow margin given what's impacting you now with deferred payment terms, discounting, fatigue, hardware digestion should in theory impact you for a couple of quarters next year?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nFirst of all, do not introduce the word fatigue in our conference call. Secondly, yes, as it relates to the free cash flow margins, I'll let Dipak jump in, in a minute. But look, it's the fine balance of making sure that we can let our annual billings continue to grow as a proportion because we think this interest rate environment is here to stay, and we can manage our free cash flow margins in the same time frame.\r\nBut the good news is because of a nicely increasing profitability, that allows us to have the capability to let our annual billings continue to get bigger and bigger because, eventually, that's what gets you. Take the extreme example on the other side. The other side extreme example is a SaaS company with annual billings, which can go back to the same degree of free cash flow margins that they have. So our opportunity is to see if we can migrate our customers to more to more, more annualized billings and continue to maintain the margins without creating a kink in there. That's what Dipak is very focused on. I don't know if you have something you want to add to that, Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nNo, the only thing that I would add is like, look, the more that you do deferred payments now, the more you actually understand your waterfall of what will come afterwards. So as long as the shift doesn't happen all at once and it's a gradual shift that you're managing, it actually gives you even more certainty than less certainty in your ability to deliver. So happy to talk offline about how we see that and why we believe that, but I think the data doesn't lie there.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext, Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research, followed by Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\n\nBenjamin James Bollin\n\nNikesh, one of the initial attributes around platform seems to be the potential for use periods and as companies displace other vendors. Could you talk about what you've seen from the use -- [potential] for use periods in those first 60-plus deals? And then maybe, Dipak, could you talk through a little bit about what it means for revenue, RPO, ARR billings and like how that waterfalls over time?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes. So in the first 50 or 60 deals, I think we've got a little sort of portfolio, all kinds of stuff that's happened. There are some customers we've had to basically wait for 6 months to be able to charge for our services because they have an existing contract, and we start implementation. So we wait that period out. Typically, those deals where we end up waiting out end up with longer duration because we don't want to give away that period over a shorter period of time, so you'll see that those deals are north of 3 years. In the case, we end up giving some sort of free use period. In smaller situations, sometimes we'll provide migration services, which allows them to get off an existing solution and move to Palo Alto as quickly as possible.\r\nAnd remember, because most of these implementations have some sort of ramp element, nobody goes and deploys 65,000 end points and turns them on in 1 day. Typically, it takes them 3 to 4 months internally to deploy those. So that actually doesn't impact us from a COGS perspective as much and allows them to have that execution flexibility, which we've always talked about as part of platformization.\r\nSo I think we've seen all variants, and I'll say, right now, the -- we're seeing more of an impact on our business from deferred payment than we are from the free periods, to be honest, right? In every case, we want to make sure the exit ARR is what we want from that customer. So our ARR, we expect it to ramp in some of these deals, which are 3- to 5-year duration where we provided free periods. But we're still -- as I said, more impact is from the billings, deferral in annual billings than it is from free periods right now. And we'll know better after Q4 because you'd expect the volume of Q4 business given the expectations and numbers should be substantially more than Q3.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question, Jonathan Ho from William Blair followed by Joel Fishbein from Truist.\n\nJonathan Frank Ho\n\nAs you add more AI capabilities to your platforms, what are customers looking to benefit from? And how do we think about the monetization opportunity here?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nSo I think if you look at some of our products, as we articulated, there are 3 specific products we announced at RSA and then we said all of our co-pilots will be available and already are available to customers for beta reasons. And then we have underlying capabilities in our products, which are AI-enabled.\r\nNow in most of our advanced services and firewalls, and I'm making a broad statement here, so -- we've increased prices from 20% of the cost of firewalls as a sub to 30%. So we have had an uptick in AI delivered services on the firewall. The customers see the value, and majority of customers have opted into that capability, which we've had for the last 2 or 3 years. And today, we've just launched the most recent one, which is Advanced DNS, which will also be uptick to a 30% instead of 20% subscription.\r\nAI Access will be sold as an incremental capability and incremental subscription for all of our VPN and for our SASE customers. So you will have monetization capability there. AI firewall would be, again, an uptick on our virtual firewalls where you have AI capability, so you'll pay a premium to protect AI installations over a traditional VM.\r\nWe're still debating whether we provide AI SPM to the market, which is effective security posture management capability as part of our firewall optionality or we charge for it separately. We will do that closer to when we launch the actual product towards July.\r\nOur co-pilots are, for the most part, available to our customers as a productivity tool, as an enhancement tool. In certain cases where we require them to ingest data to get advanced telemetry, they would have to buy the advanced telemetry modules to make the copilot even more useful for them. So that's roughly the lay of the land.\r\nBut one should expect that there should be 3 capabilities: one, better productivity for our customers, so they don't have to understand more complex UI; two, they will have to pay certain more -- somewhat more in certain use cases where they are getting incremental value and we're making incremental effort from them; then three, they might require to upgrade their underlying capabilities from base to advanced because we need the telemetry to make AI useful.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nWe'll take our last question from Joel Fishbein from Truist.\n\nJoel P. Fishbein\n\nI have an AI question, too, Nikesh, just to follow up on that. In terms of -- can you talk about the customer appetite for AI security and maybe a couple of comments about the competitive landscape around companies that are delivering products around AI security as well?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes. Look, so we had an amazing reception to our AI -- Precision AI sort of preview at RSA. We have north of a few hundred customers who signed up to have discussions with us and engage in the beta of these products. That's very good, a. B, as you'll appreciate, AI Access is an overlay product on all of our access customers. So it's a good thing because our customers say, \"I don't have to go somewhere else and get something add on and go make that happen because I expect Palo Alto will have it in 6 weeks' time. So I'm just going to wait for Palo Alto.\" And those who are keen to deploy sooner, we are able to discuss with them, show them the beta and continue to have design discussions with them.\r\nSo it sort of reduces any risk of competitive activity into our customer base where somebody else is providing AI Access Security in our own cases, one. Two, in the case of AI firewalls, I think what is unique is we are possibly the only security vendor, which has a native integration. I say native, not on top but native integration with AWS, Azure, GCP and Oracle in their public clouds, which means our firewall sits in their cloud. You can activate it from their UI, not just from our UI, and you can launch it natively in all those cloud providers. AI firewalls will be built into that capability so that you get a native capability in most large cloud service providers or a VM that you can deploy in your data center.\r\nSo again, for somebody to compete with us, they would have to have that native capability first than build it. So do we expect that Google will have it? Possibly. Microsoft? Possibly. AWS? Possibly. So the cloud providers might have that capability because they had native firewalls, but again, if you had a multi-cloud infrastructure with an LLM running in one cloud, another one running in the other cloud and some running in data center, we hopefully are the only option that allows that capability to happen. So we're trying to make sure that we do the early innovation in this space, so our customers don't have to or we don't create more fragmentation with other people having to deploy point products in that [outcome].\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nWith that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nWell, I just want to thank all of you for joining our earnings call. I appreciate your attention. I also want to thank all of our employees for all the hard work that goes into delivering great quarters and all the innovation that they've delivered. And last but not the least, thank you for all of our customers for their trust in us. See you guys next quarter.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For a company that got its started with investment money from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and other three-letter spy shops, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is dramatically transforming the way the private sector does business, and Palantir stock has benefitted.\n\nThe stock went public in 2020 at $10 a share and today trades at just under $22 a stub. It\u2019s a 130% gain during a time the S&P 500 only returned 67% for investors. That\u2019s a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, meaning it would take eight years to reach $100 per share if it kept growing at that rate. Is that reasonable? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nThe Real Opportunity for Growth\n\nFounded in 2003 as an analytics business for risk assessment for the government, Palantir eventually branched out into crunching numbers for businesses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe decision was twofold: businesses generate billions of data points that are unusable until they are deciphered and analyzed and the private sector is a much larger opportunity than the government.\n\nAlthough the public sector is still where most of Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from, it won\u2019t be long before the private sector is dominant. It is a natural outlet for Palantir\u2019s deep analysis capabilities.\n\nIn the first quarter, government sales represented 52% of the $634 million in total revenue. The government sector saw growth accelerate, sequentially rising from 11% growth in the fourth quarter to a 16% increase this quarter.\n\nCommercial revenue dropped from 70% to 40%, respectively. Still a significant increase, but Wall Street is worried private sector growth isn\u2019t unsustainable. That caused Palantir stock to tumble and made the run to $100 more challenging.\n\nA Platform to Build On\n\nBig Data companies have been around for years. More than a decade ago companies were trying to figure out how to capitalize on the quintillions of bytes of data businesses create every day.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Teradata (NYSE:TDC) were helping businesses organize and understand the information they generated long before artificial intelligence was around.\n\nIt was AI, however, that made it possible to clean, funnel and structure all of this data. Palantir Technologies went all in on AI and machine learning algorithms.\n\nIt is what enables the data analytics firm to turn the information into meaningful and actionable reports.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform in particular can integrate data from across organizations, analyze it and package the output into a visually useful product.\n\nStory continues\n\nAIP is the game-changing inflection point for the company because businesses don\u2019t have to cobble together various programs to try and achieve the same effect. Palantir can build a native solution for the company in an environment focused on security and privacy.\n\nNot a Smooth Runway for Expansion\n\nLast year Palantir began holding \u201cboot camps\u201d to introduce potential customers to what AIP offered. By the end of last year, more than 560 companies signed on, achieving for Palantir in one quarter what it thought would take at least a year to complete.\n\nThe boot camps jump-start a potential customer\u2019s introduction to generative AI. It shows Palantir is more interested in growing its customer base and not revenue. At least not at first.\n\nIt is bringing customers into the fold first, where it can cross-sell to them and build multiple streams of revenue. It\u2019s a smarter, more farsighted strategy for long-term growth.\n\nIt\u2019s also why I don\u2019t see Palantir stock hitting $100 a share in eight years. It enjoyed an early burst as generative AI captured the public\u2019s imagination. So despite the massive opportunity AI presents, the technology is still in its infancy. There will be speed bumps ahead.\n\nEurope, for example, is taking a much more adversarial role in AI adoption. Restrictive regulations on those who use it will make adoption harder. That leaves AI essentially a U.S.-dominated force.\n\nNot a small market, but also not the full-throated opportunity global expansion envisions.\n\nJust because Palantir Technologies won\u2019t immediately hit $100 doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad investment. Quite the contrary. PLTR stock would be an excellent company to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "IBM watsonx platform and IBM Granite series models will bring even more large language models to power generative AI use cases, pre-built actions, and prompts across the Salesforce Einstein 1 Platform\n\nIBM joins the Salesforce Zero Copy Partner Network to enable zero copy data integration between IBM watsonx and Salesforce Data Cloud, giving customers a secure and cost-effective way to connect all of their data and take action on it\n\nSalesforce joins the AI Alliance, bolstering its commitment to responsible AI and continuing to provide customers with trusted and reliable AI tools\n\nARMONK, N.Y. and SAN FRANCISCO, May 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) today announced an expanded strategic partnership which will bring together IBM watsonx AI and Data Platform capabilities with the Salesforce Einstein 1 Platform for greater customer choice and flexibility in AI and data deployment. This will empower teams to make data-driven decisions and take actions directly in their flow of work. IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\nThe expanded relationship spans bidirectional data integration, flexibility in large language models (LLMs), prebuilt actions and prompts for CRM solutions, and a further commitment to responsible AI development.\n\nLarge language model flexibility with IBM watsonx, Granite models, and Salesforce Organizations deploying generative AI for CRM use cases need access to LLMs that are suited to their specific business needs. Salesforce, which lets customers choose the LLMs that best suit their needs through its Bring Your Own Large Language Model strategy, plans to allow customers to integrate their LLMs with the watsonx.ai platform and Salesforce Einstein 1 Studio, a collection of low-code AI builders. This will enable access to key IBM Granite series AI models and a customer's own LLMs built on watsonx.\n\nIBM watsonx helps enterprises build, scale, and govern custom AI solutions with choice of AI models from different providers and the ability to tailor them with their own data. Granite is IBM's flagship model series trained on enterprise datasets that meet rigorous criteria for data governance, document quality, due diligence, and risk and compliance. IBM Granite models are highly performant and developer-friendly with intellectual property indemnification from IBM to its customers.\n\nIntegrating IBM Granite models with the Einstein 1 Platform will empower joint customers of IBM watsonx and Salesforce to utilize Granite models, whether hosted in the cloud or on premises, for diverse use cases including industry content generation, field summarization, and classification. These targeted models are transparent, optimized for trust and designed to scale across the enterprise. In order to help realize faster ROI of IBM Granite models for these use cases, pre-configured prompt templates and copilot actions powered by IBM data and services will be made available for Einstein 1 Studio and invocable in flow and apex.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Einstein 1 Platform integrates CRM applications, data from any external system with Data Cloud and AI models using a common metadata framework to power the next generation of AI solutions, including Einstein Copilot.\n\n\"Clients need enterprise-grade foundation models that are\u00a0trusted,\u00a0performant, and\u00a0cost-effective,\" said Ritika Gunnar, General Manager, Product Management, Data and AI, IBM. \"Choosing the right foundation models is essential to every organization's AI strategy and a key determinant of how quickly projects move from pilot to production. IBM and Salesforce are working together to make it easier to navigate the complex generative AI landscape by helping clients select the right LLM for their business needs.\"\n\nIndustry-specific IBM prompts and actions for Einstein Copilot and Copilot Studio Together with IBM Consultingand their strong industry expertise, IBM is creating powerful, industry-specific prompt templates and copilot actions which are expected to be made available in Einstein 1 Studio later this year. Using the AI builders in Einstein 1 Studio, Salesforce customers will be able to access these pre-built actions and prompts across Salesforce applications, including Einstein Copilot, Salesforce's conversational AI assistant for CRM.\n\nBeginning with public sector use cases such as government contact centers, eligibility determination, and licensing and permitting, these pre-configured prompt templates are being designed to be optimized for both foundation and Granite models to help automotive, energy and utilities, financial services and public sector users connect with their constituents on a new level.\n\nIBM Consulting is already helping joint customers establish sustainable, responsible AI frameworks to scale AI-driven Salesforce CRM initiatives across the enterprise, accelerating time to value while helping mitigate risk.\n\nIBM and Salesforce to enable bidirectional data integration between IBM watsonx and Salesforce Data Cloud IBM has joined the Salesforce Zero Copy Partner Network, a global ecosystem of technology and solution providers building secure, bidirectional zero copy integrations with Salesforce Data Cloud so data can be actioned across the Salesforce Einstein 1 Platform. Customers will be able to access their IBM data via watsonx.data\u00a0from within Salesforce Data Cloud in a zero copy pattern, simplifying security management and minimizing security risks when exposing data to the business.\n\nZero copy enables businesses to keep their data in its original location while accessing external data from Salesforce Data Cloud to create a comprehensive view of the customer. This reduces the need for companies to rely on custom integrations and complex data pipelines to integrate and move\u00a0data to Salesforce from external data warehouses and vice versa. This approach helps customers maximize their technology investments in IBM and access historical data, ensuring it remains integrated and accessible to power analytics and Generative AI. For example, a Data Cloud-triggered Flow updates an account manager in Slack when shipments are marked as delayed in an external lake, enabling them to immediately engage their client.\n\n\"Salesforce and IBM are well positioned to make it easier for customers to get the most value from their data \u2014 no matter where it resides \u2014 and establish a foundation for customer engagement and trusted AI,\" said Rahul Auradkar, EVP & GM, United Data Services & Einstein, Salesforce. \"With the addition of bidirectional data integration, companies can harmonize all of their data faster, fueling actionable insights that empower teams to make data-driven decisions and deliver amazing integrated experiences across all touchpoints and channels for\u00a0every customer interaction.\"\n\nSalesforce joins the AI Alliance, bolsters commitment to open and trusted AI development Salesforce has joined the AI Alliance and in doing so,\u00a0will support its mission to create a world where AI is developed collaboratively and transparently, with a focus on safety, ethics, and the greater good. The AI Alliance is an international community of more than 100 leading organizations across industry, startup, academia, research, and government collaborating together to advance open, safe, and responsible AI. By advocating for open innovation with leaders across industry and government, the AI Alliance seeks to foster an environment where AI can thrive and benefit people and society everywhere.\n\nIBM Granite is expected to be available in Salesforce early next year.

        "content": "Releases a family of IBM Granite models into open source, including its most capable and efficient Code LLMs that can out-perform larger code models on many industry benchmarks Jointly with Red Hat, launches InstructLab, a first-of-its-kind model alignment technique, to bring open-source community contributions directly into LLMs Unveils new vision and momentum for new data and automation capabilities; Accelerates generative AI infusion into IBM assistants, automation, infrastructure, resource management products and consulting services Strengthens collaborations with AWS, Adobe, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Palo Alto Networks, SAP, Salesforce, and\u00a0SDAIA to expand capabilities and offer model choice, flexibility and governance through watsonx\n\nARMONK, N.Y., May 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, at its annual THINK conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced several new updates to its watsonx platform one year after its introduction, as well as upcoming data and automation capabilities designed to make artificial intelligence (AI) more open, cost effective, and flexible for businesses. During his opening keynote, CEO Arvind Krishna will share the company's plans to invest in, build and contribute to the open-source AI community as a core part of IBM's strategy.\n\n\"We firmly believe in bringing open innovation to AI. We want to use the power of open source to do with AI what was successfully done with Linux and OpenShift,\" said Krishna. \"Open means choice. Open means more eyes on the code, more minds on the problems, and more hands on the solutions. For any technology to gain velocity and become ubiquitous, you've got to balance three things: competition, innovation, and safety. Open source is a great way to achieve all three.\"\n\nIBM released a family of Granite models into open source and launched InstructLab, a first-of-its-kind capability, in collaboration with Red Hat\n\nFurthering its commitment to the open-source AI ecosystem, IBM has now open sourced a family of its most advanced and\u00a0performant language and code Granite models. By open sourcing these models, IBM is inviting clients, developers and global experts to build on these strengths and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in enterprise environments.\n\nAvailable today under Apache 2.0 licenses on Hugging Face and GitHub, the open-source Granite models stand out for their development process, quality, transparency and efficiency. The Granite code models range from 3B to 34B parameters and come in both base and instruction-following model variants, which are suitable for tasks such as complex application modernization, code generation, fixing bugs, explaining and documenting code, maintaining repositories and more. The code models, trained on 116 programming languages, consistently reach state-of-the-art performance among open-source code LLMs across various code-related tasksi:\n\nStory continues\n\nTesting by IBM found that the Granite Code models overall show very strong performance across all model sizes and benchmarks, often outperforming other open-source code models that are twice as large compared to Granite.ii Testing by IBM on benchmarks including HumanEvalPack, HumanEvalPlus, and reasoning benchmark GSM8K showed Granite code models have strong performances on code synthesis, fixing, explanation, editing, and translation across most major programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, and Rust.iii The 20B parameter Granite base code model was used to train IBM watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) for specialized domains. It also powers\u00a0watsonx Code Assistant for Z \u2014 a product designed to help enterprises transform monolithic COBOL applications into services optimized for IBM Z. The 20B parameter Granite base code model was tuned to generate SQL from natural language questions for the purpose of transforming structured data and extracting insights from that data. IBM demonstrated leadership in natural language to SQL, an important industry use case, as benchmarked by BIRD's independent leaderboard, which ranks models according to Execution Accuracy (EX) and Valid Efficiency Score (VES).iv\n\nIBM and Red Hat also recently launched InstructLab \u2014 a revolutionary approach to advancing true open-source innovation around LLMs.\n\nThe InstructLab methodology allows for continuous development of base models through constant incremental contributions, much like software development has worked in open source for decades. With InstructLab, developers can build models specific to their business domains or industries with their own data, so that they can see the direct value of AI rather than just the model providers seeing the value. IBM plans to harness these open-source contributions to bring additional value to its clients through integrations with watsonx.ai and the new Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) solution.\n\nRHEL AI comprises an\u00a0enterprise-ready version of the InstructLab, IBM's open-source Granite models, and the world's leading enterprise Linux platform to simplify AI deployment across hybrid infrastructure environments. Read this blog to learn more about Instruct Lab and watsonx.ai.\n\nIBM Consulting is also launching a practice to help clients leverage InstructLab with their own proprietary data to train purpose-specific AI models that can be scaled to better fit the cost and performance requirements of an enterprise's business needs. Read this blog to learn more about how IBM Consulting is helping enterprises adopt AI.\n\nIBM unveils a new class of watsonx assistants\n\nThis new wave of AI innovation has the potential to unlock an estimated $4 trillion in annual economic benefits across industries.v However, IBM's annual Global AI Adoption Index recently found that while 42% of enterprise-scale companies (> 1,000 employees) surveyed have implemented AI in their business, another 40% of those companies that are exploring or experimenting with AI have yet to deploy their models. For the companies stuck in the sandbox, 2024 is the year of overcoming barriers to entry such as the skills gap, data complexity and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 trust.\n\nTo address these challenges, IBM is announcing several upcoming updates and enhancements to its family of watsonx assistants, along with an upcoming capability in watsonx Orchestrate to help clients build their own AI Assistants across domains.\n\nThe new AI Assistants include watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications (planned availability in October 2024), watsonx Assistant for Z to transform how users interact with the system to quickly transfer knowledge and expertise (planned availability in June 2024), and an expansion of watsonx Code Assistant for Z Service with code explanation to help clients understand and document applications through natural language (planned availability in June 2024). Read more on watsonx Code Assistant for Enterprise Java Applications, watsonx Assistant for Z, and Watsonx Code Assistant for Z.\n\nIBM is expanding its NVIDIA GPU offerings to now offer NVIDIA L40S and NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs, as well as support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) and OpenShift AI to help enterprises and developers address the needs of AI and other mission-critical workloads. Additionally, to help clients accelerate time to value for AI, IBM is using deployable architectures for watsonx to enable quick AI deployment while empowering enterprises with security and compliance capabilities to help them protect their data and manage compliance controls. Read this blog to learn more about IBM Cloud capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, IBM has announced several new and upcoming generative AI powered data products and capabilities to augment how organizations observe, govern, and optimize their increasingly robust and complex data for AI workloads. Learn more about the upcoming IBM Data Product Hub (planned availability in June 2024), Data Gate for watsonx (planned availability in June 2024), and a host of the latest and planned updates on watsonx.data. Read this blog to learn more about these data capabilities.\n\nIBM previews new vision and capabilities for AI-powered automation\n\nHybrid cloud and AI are transforming how companies do business. The average enterprise today manages multiple cloud environments \u2014 public and private \u2014 and around 1,000 apps,vi each with multiple dependencies. They also deal with petabytes of data. With generative AI expected to drive up to 1 billion apps by 2028,vii automation is no longer an option \u2013 it is how businesses will save time, solve problems, and make decisions faster.\n\nIBM is addressing these challenges by delivering a set of AI-powered automation capabilities that will allow CIOs to move from proactive management of their IT environments to AI-powered predictive automation. AI-powered automation will be an essential tool for driving the speed, performance, scalability, security, cost efficiency of an enterprise's infrastructure.\n\nToday, IBM's portfolio of automation, networking, data, application, and infrastructure management products help businesses manage their increasingly complex IT environments. For technology business management, Apptio enables organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions about their investments by driving clarity on technology spend and how it drives business value \u2014 enabling organizations to quickly respond to changing market conditions. Clients can also combine Apptio with the power of Instana for automated observability and Turbonomic for performance optimization to help clients efficiently allocate resources and control IT spend through enhanced visibility and real-time insights, allowing\u00a0them to focus more time on deploying and scaling AI to drive new innovative initiatives.\n\nTo complement these products, IBM recently announced its intent to acquire HashiCorp, which helps organizations automate multi-cloud and hybrid environments with Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management with products including Terraform, Vault and others. With HashiCorp, clients can easily move to and operate across multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nNow, at THINK, IBM is continuing to advance its state-of-the-art in automation portfolio by previewing a new generative AI-powered tool called\u00a0IBM Concert, which will be generally available in June 2024. IBM Concert will serve as the 'nerve center' of an enterprise's technology and operations.\n\nPowered by AI from watsonx, IBM Concert will provide generative AI-driven insights across clients' portfolios of applications to identify, predict, and suggest fixes for problems. The new tool integrates into clients' existing systems, using generative AI to connect with data from their cloud infrastructure, source repositories, CI/CD pipelines and other existing application management solutions to build out a detailed view of their connected applications.\n\nBy allowing clients to eliminate unnecessary tasks and accelerate others, Concert is designed to make teams more informed so they can be fast and responsive in addressing issues and solving problems before they happen. Concert will initially focus on helping application owners, SREs and IT leaders gain insights about, pre-empt and more quickly address issues around application risk and compliance management. Read this blog to learn more about IBM Concert.\n\nIBM expands ecosystem access to watsonx, adds third-party models\n\nIBM continues to foster a strong ecosystem of partners to offer clients choice and flexibility through bringing third-party models onto watsonx, enabling leading software companies to embed watsonx capabilities into their technologies, and offering IBM Consulting expertise for enterprise business transformation.

        "content": "Investors should have a wide range of companies in multiple sectors within their investment portfolio. But the backbone of any resilient portfolio that can withstand a bear market and soar during a bull market are\u00a0blue-chip stocks. Companies with a strong reputation and industry-leading giants are among the most important additions for investors regarding continued growth within their portfolios.\n\nI have chosen three blue-chip stocks to buy with common traits that allow them to experience continued growth in the near term.\n\nThese are income-generation stocks that supply investors with solid dividend yields. Trading at a fair valuation and having a growth catalyst, such as increased earnings or acquisitions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nComcast (CMCSA) Image of the Comcast (CMCSA) logo on the back of a white van in a rural area\n\nSource: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.com\n\nComcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a leading media and technology company that offers broadband and wireless services to residential and commercial customers. It operates multiple Universal theme park locations in California, Florida, Japan, and China and owns the streaming service Peacock.\n\nOver the past year, Comcast\u2019s share price has remained practically unchanged. However, with a strong valuation and dividend growth, CMCSA could be one of the solid blue-chip stocks to buy for investors looking to improve their portfolios.\n\nOn April 25, Comcast reported\u00a0earnings for the first quarter of 2024,\u00a0stating total revenue increased by 1% and adjusted net income rose by 8% year-over-year. Most notably, its free cash flow surged by 19% within the same period. Additionally, Peacock\u2019s paid subscribers increased 55% compared to the previous year. Recently, solid revenue-grossing movies such as Kung Fu Panda 4 and The Fall Guys were released.\n\nIn this first quarter, Comcast repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares, and its wireless customer lines increased 21% year over year. Comcast\u2019s annual dividend yield is 3.16%, which amounts to a quarterly dividend of 31 cents per share. Its most recent dividend was distributed to investors on April 1.\n\nComcast has recently experienced growth across the board with its customer base, especially surrounding Peacock and its wireless, having rapid growth. It provides a strong cash position, which is a great sign to investors. It also offers a fair valuation, with its forward P/E ratio being 9.33, while the sector average is 13.86.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a pharmaceutical manufacturer that distributes various medications and vaccines to treat cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Most notably, it provided the Covid-19 vaccine alongside BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX)\n\nStory continues\n\nOver this past year, its star price has fallen significantly by 22% following a large reduction in the need for its COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOn May 1, Pfizer reported\u00a0earnings for Q1 2024, stating that total revenue fell by 20% and its net income dropped by 44% to $3.1 billion. Pfizer also reaffirmed its guidance for the full year 2024. Pfizer offers a decent dividend yield of 5.87% on an annual basis. Its most recent dividend was sent out to investors for 42 cents per share on May 8.\n\nPfizer has begun to experience a rebound in its share price within the last month. The stock price has risen by 12% with the acquisition of Seagen, a biotech company focused on oncology research and treatments. It could be a growth catalyst for Pfizer.\n\nPFE has a decent valuation with a forward P/E ratio of 12.23, below the median sector forward P/E of 19.94.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) provides a range of technology services, including software and hardware, enabling generative AI and cloud-based services to operate. Notable vendors for IBM include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).\n\nOn April 24, IBM released its Q1 2024 earnings, stating total revenue increased by 1% while net income rose 73%. However, it fell short of analyst expectations, resulting in the stock price falling by 8%.\n\nIBM also mentioned in its\u00a0earnings release that it acquired HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP), a cloud infrastructure company, for $35 a share, which equates to approximately $6.4 billion in total enterprise value. The goal of this acquisition is to help improve IBM\u2019s cloud platform.\n\nIBM also offers a dividend yield of 3.95% on an annual basis. Its most recent distribution to investors was one dollar and 67 cents per share on May 8. IBM is trading at a great valuation. A forward P/E ratio of 16.91, while the sector average is 24.22, makes it a solid blue-chip buy for investors.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "Your Portfolio Is a Garden. Weed It",
        "content": "I don't believe in the old stock-market saying Sell in May and Go Away. In my opinion, you should never go away from the stock market altogether. But May is a good time to weed out your portfolio.\n\nUnless you have a strong reason to do otherwise, I would:\n\nSell any stock you've held for three years with no price appreciation. Sell any stock whose price is 60 times per-share earnings or more. Sell the stock of any company that has posted losses in the past year, unless you have a reasonable basis to believe it will be profitable soon. Take a hard look at any stock that has declined 20% or more from the purchase price. Ask yourself whether the original purchase rationale still holds.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MSTR.\n\nHere are a few large, widely held stocks that I would consider selling now.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nMicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), a Tysons Corner, Virginia company headed by Michael Saylor, sells software for enterprise analytics and mobility. But the stock doesn't trade based on that business.\n\nIt trades based on the company's holdings of bitcoin. MicroStrategy owns some 214,000 of the crypto tokens. That is more than 1% of the 19.7 million bitcoins that have been issued so far. It's about 1% of the 21 million coins that will ultimately be issued.\n\nAs of May 19, one bitcoin cost $66,934.60. So 214,000 of them would be valued at $14.3 billion. That is about half the market value of MicroStrategy stock.\n\nMicroStrategy has financed its cryptocurrency purchases in large part by issuing notes convertible to common stock. So the current stockholders are at risk of seeing the value of their holdings diluted.\n\nThe company has posted a loss in three of the past four years.\n\nCarlyle Group\n\nCarlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CG), with headquarters in Washington D.C., is one of the larger private equity firms in the U.S. Such firms invest in private companies or take public companies private. They often cut costs, try to enhance revenue and then take the companies public in a few years.\n\nThe acquisitions are usually done with borrowed money, and the cost of borrowing money has risen a lot in the past year.\n\nThe stock seems expensive to me at 12 times the company's revenue. Revenue has declined over the past year, five years and 10 years.\n\nCytokinetics\n\nMuscular diseases are the focus at Cytokinetics Inc. (NASDAQ:CYTK), a biotechnology firm based in South San Francisco, California. It is working on treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), heart failure and several other conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has posted losses in 13 of the past 15 years. Its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about $396 million. A clinical research breakthrough could prove me wrong, but I think the stock is overvalued at the current market capitalization of of $6.2 billion.\n\nBoeing\n\nIn the past few years, Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) planes have experienced two controversial crashes and one notorious door-panel blowout. The company will have to spend more on safety and redundant quality checks. This will slow down production and dampen sales, I believe.\n\nBoeing has liabilities of $151.5 billion and assets of $134.50 billion. Of the past 10 years, only five have been profitable.\n\nLyft\n\nLyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) plays second fiddle to Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the U.S. ride-hailing market, with $4.4 billion in revenue last year, compared to Uber's $37.3 billion. While Uber turned profitable in 2023, Lyft has yet to show an annual profit, although analysts expect to see one this year.\n\nTo me it is a cautionary sign that Lyft's debt is more than twice the company's equity.\n\nThe record\n\nI offer sell recommendations once a year in this column, usually in May. My sells from a year ago trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index by 10 percentage points, rising 18.40% while the index climbed 28.42%.\n\nClorox Co. (NYSE:CLX) declined 14%. Colgate-Palmolive Co. (NYSE:CL) and Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) rose, but less than the benchmark. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) beat the index, with gains of 38% and 36% respectively.\n\nLonger-term results are mixed. My sell recommendations have trailed behind the index 10 times out of 16 as they should. However, due to bad picks I made in 2005 and 2010, the average return on my sells has been 13%, while the S&P has averaged 12.20%.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nDisclosure: A hedge fun I manage owns put options on Boeing.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts, and a syndicated columnist. His firm or clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column. He can be reached at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Cheap Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "If you\u2019re searching for cheap quantum computing stocks to invest in for early next year, there are a few companies worth watching. I expect these companies to perform well throughout 2024 due to their continued development and the gradual roll-out of their development road maps.\n\nQuantum computing companies are set to disrupt numerous industries with their technologies, ranging from healthcare to economic research and everything in between. The enormous leap in processing power will allow us to model previously impossible processes in classical computing.\n\nAs a result, there has been heavy interest from institutional investors in the space, and an arms race between companies to release the first commercialized quantum system is underway.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s dive in and discover the most promising affordable quantum computing stocks for 2024 and beyond. I think that these companies are bargains at their current levels that shouldn\u2019t be ignored for too long by investors.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) specializes in quantum computing, providing systems across major cloud services. Despite being in a developmental stage with minimal revenue, it\u2019s a pioneer as the first pure-play quantum computing company to go public.\n\nIn the first quarter, IONQ achieved $7.58 million in revenue, marking a 77% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. Despite the revenue growth, the company recorded a net loss of $39.6 million, which widened by 45% from the previous year.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, IONQ has raised its bookings guidance to between $75 million and $95 million, signaling confidence in its sales pipeline and business expansion.\n\nDespite this, I still feel that IONQ is undervalued, as it trades for just $8.71 at the time of writing. It also has far lower valuation ratios than many of the FAANG, big tech stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), thus making it one of those firms to consider.\n\nQuantum Computing Inc. (QUBT)\n\nSource: Bartlomiej K. Wroblewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) focuses on both quantum software and hardware, with notable products like the Qatalyst software and quantum processing units. Its acquisition of QPhoton enhances its capabilities, aiming at practical applications across various sectors including finance and healthcare.\n\nThey\u2019ve been particularly active in expanding their offerings, such as the introduction of the Dirac-3 entropy quantum computer, which is designed for complex optimization tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the factors making QUBT\u2019s offerings potentially appealing in terms of cost is their focus on creating quantum solutions that are both accessible and affordable. Their products are designed to operate at room temperature and consume low power, which reduces operational costs. These characteristics are intended to make their technology more practical and feasible for broader applications.\n\nAs of the end of September 2023, the company reported total liabilities of approximately $8.1 million, a decrease from the previous year. This reduction was primarily driven by regular debt repayments and a significant decrease in expenses. This then makes it one of those cheap quantum computing stocks by book value.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) conceptual illustration representing quantum computing\n\nSource: ArtemisDiana / Shutterstock.com\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is known for its development and production of quantum integrated circuits and a dedicated cloud platform for quantum algorithms.\n\nTheir strategy includes expanding their technological capabilities and securing strategic partnerships with major organizations like NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy to advance quantum computing.\n\nFor 2024, Rigetti\u2019s financial performance shows they are navigating a challenging phase, with a reported revenue of $3.05 million for the first quarter and an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.14, missing the expected -$0.08 EPS by $0.06. This follows a pattern from the previous year, where their quarterly earnings consistently fell short of expectations.\n\nKey valuation ratios for Rigetti include a Price/Sales (PS) ratio of 15.37 and a Price/Book (PB) ratio of 1.71. The forward PS is projected at 11.11. This then prices it favorably compared to many of its peers, and signals that it could be undervalued and therefore cheap.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), traditionally known for its GPUs, is also involved in quantum computing, particularly through its simulation platforms that facilitate quantum computing research and development.\n\nNVDA has developed the CUDA-Q platform, an open-source, QPU-agnostic quantum-classical accelerated computing framework. This platform is instrumental in integrating quantum computing units (QPUs) with classical computing systems like GPUs.\n\nRecently, Nvidia announced the acceleration of quantum computing capabilities globally through their CUDA-Q platform, highlighting its deployment in Japan\u2019s ABCI-Q supercomputer. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to boost national quantum computing efforts.\n\nAlthough NVDA\u2019s valuation ratios are high, this could be seen as fairly priced or even undervalued when compared to its growth potential. It\u2019s also one of the few stocks that have numerous growth drivers that could spur share price appreciation: from quantum, to blockchain, to semiconductors and of course gaming.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0is a major player in quantum computing, offering cloud-based quantum computing services and continuous advancements in quantum hardware and software. IBM Q System One is notable for its integration into the quantum industry.\n\nIBM could be a pick for a cautious investor due to its historically low beta, dividend growth rate and yield, and stable history.\n\nA notable development in IBM\u2019s quantum development is their Qiskit platform, which is central to their strategy. Qiskit aids users in leveraging IBM\u2019s quantum systems more effectively by simplifying the programming of quantum circuits and integrating quantum computations with classical processes.\n\nIBM\u2019s efforts are also supported by its extensive quantum network, involving collaborations with universities, research labs, and industry leaders worldwide to advance quantum computing applications.\n\nIBM\u2019s stock price is not cheap at $168 per share at the time of writing, and it has less aggressive growth prospects than others. Still, it may be worth considering for investors who want a less-risky foray into the world of quantum computing.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft quantum efforts include developing topological qubits and offering quantum computing services through Azure Quantum. Its holistic approach includes both hardware and software advancements in quantum technologies.\n\nA major focus has been on achieving reliable logical qubits, a critical step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. In partnership with Quantinuum, Microsoft has made a breakthrough by demonstrating logical qubits with error rates significantly lower than physical qubits.\n\nAzure Quantum, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based quantum computing platform, is a central part of their strategy. It offers tools and services that enable users to write, run, and manage quantum code directly in the cloud. It is also developing its own toolkit exclusively for future quantum developers called Q#, which I think will give it a significant leg up over its competitors.\n\nMSFT\u2019s market cap at around 3 trillion makes it one of the most valuable in the world, so its valuation is not cheap on paper. However, I feel that it could be seen as undervalued when one takes its quantum progress into consideration and other growth headwinds such as AI through its partnership and investment into OpenAI.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet has made significant strides in quantum computing, claiming quantum supremacy in 2019. Its quantum computer, Sycamore, performed a calculation in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers much longer.\n\nAlphabet has made notable advancements in both hardware and software for quantum computing. It is working on scaling up its quantum computers, with ambitious plans to increase qubit numbers to 1 million by the end of the decade, aiming for an error-corrected, commercially viable quantum computer.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet has spun out its quantum technology efforts into an independent company called Sandbox AQ, which continues to work on applying quantum technology to enterprise use cases.\n\nJust with the other big FAANG stocks in the quantum space, Alphabet\u2019s valuation remains high. One thing to keep in mind though is that its EPS is set to soar over the next few years, increasing by double digit amounts.\n\nAlphabet maintains an incredibly strong competitive moat with its Google and YouTube platforms, and its Gemini AI has shown promise in incorporating it into the search results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Companies Already Working on the Next Phase of Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "The field of artificial intelligence is still in its early years, yet several businesses are already working on technology that can become the foundation for AI's future. These companies are developing quantum computing systems capable of processing mountains of data in seconds, which would take decades for a conventional computer.\n\nQuantum machines can execute multiple computations simultaneously, accelerating processing time, while typical computers must process data in a linear fashion. This means quantum systems can evolve AI beyond the abilities of the most powerful supercomputers, enabling AI to drive cars and help find cures to diseases.\n\nThree businesses developing quantum computing technology have achieved impressive results. They are Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), and IonQ(NYSE: IONQ). Here's a look at how they are creating tech that can drive the next phase of AI.\n\nMicrosoft's many strengths\n\nMicrosoft may be known for its ubiquitous Windows computer system, but it invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence, including in OpenAI, the firm that helped to kick off the current AI wave with ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft's work in quantum computing sets it up to power future AI systems. The company began building quantum machines in 2006 and is pioneering a new type of quantum bit, or qubit for short, which is akin to a bit in a conventional computer. Every quantum computer employs subatomic particles to perform computations measured in qubits.\n\nIn April, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in its quantum computers by improving error rates by 800 times. Because subatomic particles are highly unstable, errors in calculations are prone to happen.\n\nThe company's error rate achievement represents the most reliable qubit on record, according to Microsoft. This marks a key step in producing quantum computers capable of realizing the next generation of AI.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft's financial strength gives it an advantage in the space. The company has built one of the biggest cloud computing businesses in the world, enabling Microsoft to generate $61.9 billion in its fiscal third quarter that ended March 31, a 17% year-over-year revenue increase.\n\nThis helped the company produce strong fiscal Q3 free cash flow (FCF) of $21 billion, up 18% year over year. Microsoft can use its hefty FCF to fuel investments in quantum computing.\n\nIBM's quantum computing successes\n\nIBM's work in AI stretches back to the 1950s. Today, AI is a focus of the company. So, it makes sense that it would also invest in quantum systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, IBM is seen as one of the leaders in quantum computing. It was the first company to make a quantum computer available in the cloud in 2016. Since then, Big Blue deployed over 80 quantum systems.\n\nFor instance, IBM partnered with Cleveland Clinic to provide AI and implement a quantum computer that was touted as the first dedicated to healthcare research. And last December, IBM released the first quantum computer with a 1,000-qubit processor.\n\nBig Blue can finance quantum computing research because of its solid FCF generation. This not only funds business investments but also the company's hefty dividend, currently yielding around 4%.\n\nIn Q1, the company produced $1.9 billion in FCF, up 43% from the prior year. IBM expects 2024 FCF to come in around $12 billion, ensuring Big Blue can continue to fund its quantum computing work.\n\nAs an investment, IBM is more of an income stock than a fast-growing tech stock. Its Q1 revenue of $14.5 billion represented only 1% year-over-year growth due to softness in its consulting and infrastructure businesses.\n\nHowever, its software division, which includes sales from AI and quantum computing, is doing well. This segment produced Q1 revenue of $5.9 billion, a 5.5% increase over 2023.\n\nIonQ's rapid growth\n\nUpstart IonQ, founded in 2015, is a relative newcomer. It's also the only pure quantum computing company on this list, meaning its resources are entirely devoted to this technology.\n\nDespite its brief history, IonQ captured an impressive customer list. Clients include Hyundai, which is using IonQ's tech to build self-driving vehicles, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which will use IonQ's quantum systems to improve the U.S. power grid.\n\nThese kinds of successes enabled the company to hit $7.6 million in Q1 revenue, a 77% year-over-year increase. IonQ expects to achieve at least another $7.6 million in Q2, up from $5.5 million in 2023.\n\nThe firm achieved its latest quantum technical milestone a year earlier than planned, setting it up to reach a tipping point in 2025 where \"classical computers will no longer be able to fully simulate an IonQ system,\" according to the company.\n\nWith IonQ, IBM, and Microsoft building technology to deliver the next phase of AI, now is a good time to consider buying stock in these quantum computing giants.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "Alphabet's recent decision to issue a dividend reinforces a notable trend: the evolution of tech stocks as dividend payers. This is significant since many tech stocks tend to eschew dividends in favor of reinvesting for growth. It also confirms an impulse to offer payouts once they reach maturity.\n\nAdmittedly, Alphabet's dividend return of 0.5% is too small for it to attract the attention of income investors. Nonetheless, some tech stocks have begun to offer cash returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500's 1.3% average. With a continuous commitment to innovation, income investors should take notice of the potentially lucrative and growing payouts in these three stocks.\n\nInternational Business Machines\n\nAs one of the first tech companies to reach maturity, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) offered dividends to investors for decades. In April, it announced it would hike its payout to $6.68 per share annually. While that was an increase of just 0.6%, it marks the 29th consecutive year the dividend has increased.\n\nAlso, with a dividend yield of 4%, it has arguably become the dividend stock of the cloud. Arvind Krishna drove the 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, which placed IBM on the path to becoming a full-fledged cloud company.\n\nThat role in the cloud has also made it a player in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. This includes its team of consultants, IBM Research, and IBM watsonx. Watsonx is a business application that includes tools for model creation, storage, and AI governance.\n\nAdditionally, the company's stock has risen since Krishna became CEO in April 2020, a dramatic turnaround for a stock that lost value in most of the 2010s.\n\nWhile one cannot describe IBM as a \"growth stock,\" the revenue declines have largely reversed under Krishna's leadership, and profits have increased.\n\nMoreover, in the first quarter of 2024, the $12 billion in free cash flow for the trailing 12 months far exceeded the $6 billion in dividend cost during that time. This makes it likely that IBM will not only keep its payout, but also increase it on an annual basis.\n\nCrown Castle\n\nCrown Castle (NYSE: CCI) plays a largely unseen but critical role in the wireless industry. It specializes in \"vertical real estate,\" owning many of the towers that support the United States' wireless infrastructure.\n\nAs a real estate investment trust (REIT), it pays at least 90% of its net income in dividends in exchange for an income tax exemption on its operational profits.\n\nTo that end, shareholders earn $6.26 per share annually on the payout, a 6% cash return. Although Crown Castle has not increased the dividend since late 2022, the yearly payout has risen every year since it initiated the dividend in 2014.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdmittedly, Crown Castle faces some uncertainty, including a recent CEO change. Steven Moskowitz took over as CEO after former CEO Jay Brown retired in January. Still, even his 25 years of industry experience does not guarantee his success as a leader.\n\nMoreover, revenue declines occurred as some Sprint contracts continue to get canceled due to its takeover by T-Mobile US.\n\nDespite challenges, funding the dividend has not been an issue. Over the trailing 12 months, the dividend cost the company about $2.7 billion. This is significantly below the $3.2 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) income that funds the payout. That increases the likelihood that it will hike the payout this year and maintain its streak of annual dividend increases.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is credited with building the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, and its hardware and software solutions continue to support the world's technology infrastructure.\n\nWhile it has become a slower-growth stock in recent years, it evolved into a notable dividend play. Its $1.60 per share in annual dividends yields about 3.2%. Even though the payout increased by less than 3% last year, it has risen every year since Cisco initiated the dividend in 2011.\n\nDespite its dividend, the stock never recovered from the dot-com bust of the early 2000s as its switching and router business fell victim to falling demand and competition. More recently, it has become more of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock and recently acquired Splunk to increase its presence in cybersecurity. Still, it remains a mature, slower-growth business.\n\nDespite its slowdown, Cisco generated nearly $14 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This covered about $6.3 billion in dividend costs, increasing the likelihood that the payout hikes will continue. Although investors should not expect Cisco to become a high-flying tech stock again, it should remain an attractive option for investors seeking income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Small-Cap Growth Opportunities in the AI Era",
        "content": "It\u2019s certainly a very good time to be in the AI business. After all, the technology has been getting huge amounts of positive publicity since December 2022, and it\u2019s being viewed as a powerful, helpful tool for humans. As a result, many AI stocks, such as Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), SoundhoundAI (NASDAQ:SOUN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), have skyrocketed. But there are still a multitude of small-cap AI stocks that are laboring in obscurity. These firms have all the advantages of being involved in AI, but their stocks do not yet come close to reflecting their tremendous potential. Here are three small-cap growth stocks to buy.\n\nInnodata (INOD) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nInnodata (NASDAQ:INOD) uses data sets to train AI models for other firms. Innodata also helps businesses direct their AI models to perform certain tasks. Additionally, the firm digitalizes medical records and provides a marketing platform.\n\nMany large companies, including IBM (NYSE:IBM), Palantir and Accenture (NYSE:ACN), are helping firms implement AI. But my sense is that Innodata is more technical and enables more detailed capabilities than many of these firms. Moreover, Innodata, which was founded back in 1988, is largely dedicated to AI and likely has much more experience with the technology than many if not most of its competitors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast quarter, the firm\u2019s top line jumped 41% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.5 million. Its EBITDA, excluding certain items, came in at $3.8 million, up from $800,000 in Q1 of 2023.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gives INOD stock an Accumulation/Distribution grade of B. That\u2019s a high grade for a small-cap stock and indicates that many institutional investors are starting to buy INOD stock.\n\nGiven the firm\u2019s strong outlook and powerful growth, along with the Street\u2019s interest in the name, INOD stock is one of the top small-cap growth stocks to buy.\n\nMitek Systems (MITK) A concept image of a person touching a hologram fingerprint\n\nSource: Alexander Supertramp/Shutterstock.com\n\nMitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) provides identity software that utilizes AI. Currently, its technology is used to enable consumers to deposit checks with their smartphones and to detect check fraud. However, given increases in online fraud and continuous advances in AI, along with increased interest in the technology, I expect Mitek to use its technology to introduce new, highly successful products over the longer term. Indeed, the firm has developed voice authentication technology that it says \u201copens up several new avenues for growth.\u00a0\u201c\n\nDuring Mitek\u2019s FY that ended in September 2023, its revenue came in at $172.6 million, up from $144.8 million during the previous fiscal year. Additionally, it generated operating income of $21.1 million. up from $15.7 million during the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMitek has a low forward price-earnings ratio of 14.4 times.\n\niCAD (ICAD) an image of a microscope, NEXI stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\niCAD\u2019s (NASDAQ:ICAD) products utilize AI to more accurately detect breast cancer. Last quarter, the company\u2019s sales team began systematically using lead generation programs for the first time and added four new sales representatives to its team which had previously utilized six sales representatives. Additionally, in December, the firm added a new head of North American sales in December. Finally, iCAD worked harder to obtain more revenue from its existing customers.\n\nThe changes enabled iCAD to grow very rapid as its revenue climbed 14% last quarter versus the same period earlier to $4.95 million. Making the gain even more impressive, iCAD had divested its cancer therapy business, Xoft, at the end of last year.\n\nAlso impressively, the firm made significant, new deals last quarter with entities in Turkey, Israel, Serbia and France in Q1. These contracts indicate that the company can generate meaningful revenue going forward from countries outside of North America.\n\nI believe that iCAD\u2019s current market capitalization of $43 million is many times below its long-term potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in ICAD. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Quantum Computing Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "Quantum computing has the potential to usher in a new era of computing power. While the market is still digesting the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they have yet to focus in on the next big discovery.\n\nRemarkably, quantum computers have the ability to perform optimization and predictive tasks faster than conventional computers. They do require a load of capital to build and maintain. So only a select few public companies in the market specialize in this field.\n\nAs U.S. equities remain rather volatile, it\u2019s probably best to stay away from small-cap pure-play quantum computing stock. Why? Their ability to generate profits for shareholders is still up in the air. So, let\u2019s examine larger tech companies that have made significant strides in developing quantum computers. And the icing on the cake is, Wall Street is optimistic about all of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for software giant and household name, Google. Having already written about Alphabet stock in the past, I\u2019m still bullish on the company\u2019s share price. It trades at a 21.9x forward earnings, which is lower than competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the tech giant has many tailwinds guiding its rise, including advanced computing technologies.\n\nIn fact, Google has been developing quantum computing technology for well over a decade now. Sycamore is the name of Google\u2019s quantum computer gem. This quantum system has 70 qubits, which is higher than a prior version of the computer. Similar to normal bytes, qubits can be in a state of 0 or 1. However, they can be in these states simultaneously, endowing them with more processing power than a normal computer.\n\nAccording to Koyfin, Google has 59 Wall Street analysts covering its shares, and 48 of them have given the stock a strong buy or buy rating.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nImpressively, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have soared well over 200% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe reason? The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The chipmaker is the key provider of advanced chips that power large-language models for training AI chatbots. Nvidia\u2019s state-of-the-art Blackwell chips will develop improved AI models for both businesses and consumers. In addition to its lead in AI processing power, Nvidia is paving the way for quantum computers.\n\nFurther, Nvidia has developed an open-source platform dubbed CUDA-Q. It allows quantum computing scientists to program and integrate quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical computing systems like GPUs and CPUs. The influence of Nvidia\u2019s quantum computing platform goes beyond quantum computing systems in the U.S. In fact, national research centers in Germany, Japan and Poland are relying upon Nvidia\u2019s open-source programming system to create their own quantum computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, as AI takes the forefront of the NVDA stock discussion, investors should also consider the chipmaker\u2019s foray into quantum computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another legacy tech business that has dipped more than one toe in the quantum computing space.\n\nIBM has been pursuing quantum computing research since the early 2000s. And the company\u2019s desire to stay at the forefront of research in the field has not abated. Last year, IBM seemed to have extended its lead in quantum computing processors. The release of the Condor system took the market by storm. This quantum processor has 1,121 superconducting qubits, rendering it the largest quantum computing chip that has been developed.\n\nHowever, not all the news is positive. IBM has suffered with sluggish growth over the past few years. The uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment certainly has not helped. Nevertheless, quantum computing could prove to be an important growth lever for the business. IBM trades at 17.0x forward earnings and has received a couple of strong buy ratings from Wall Street firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Cybersecurity remains an important and fast-growing industry. The global market for cybersecurity is forecast to grow by about 10% per year and, by 2028, reach nearly $275 billion. The market is being driven by all facets of society: individuals, businesses and governments, all of which are vulnerable to cyberattacks. And cyber incidents are becoming more and more costly every year.\n\nAccording to the FBI, cybercrime cost individual Americans more than $12 billion in 2023, and that cost is rising as both domestic and foreign criminals illegally access computers and networks, stealing money, data and other valuable information and assets. In all, cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy $8 trillion, equal to about $250,000 per second. No wonder cybersecurity companies are thriving.\n\nHere are the three most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy in May 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) will be looking to get out of the dog house with investors when it reports its next financial results on May 20. PANW stock fell 19% after the company\u2019s last print in which it lowered its full-year guidance for both revenue and billings. The lowered guidance stole the show and analysts and investors seemed not to notice that Palo Alto beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe company forecast full-year 2024 billings of $10.10 billion to $10.20 billion. This is down from previous guidance of $10.70 billion to $10.80 billion. Full-year revenues were also lowered to between $7.95 billion and $8 billion, which was lower than the previous guide for $8.15 billion to $8.20 billion. Management said during their earnings call that the lowered guidance was due to a shift in strategy and wanting to accelerate growth in AI products. Mentioning AI, however, did little to help the stock.\n\nYear-to-date, PANW stock is up only 5%. Investors may want to take a position before the next print leads to a rebound in share price.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm SentinelOne (NYSE:S) are down 16% this year despite the fact that the company delivered financial results that topped the consensus forecasts of Wall Street analysts. For the fourth quarter of 2023, SentinelOne reported an earnings per share (EPS) loss of 2 cents, which was much better than the loss of 4 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue for the quarter came in at $174.2 million, up 38% from a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street estimates of $169 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Palo Alto, SentinelOne was undone by guidance that underwhelmed investors, sending its stock down 11% immediately after the print, where it has languished ever since. For all of this year, SentinelOne sees revenue of $812 million to $818 million. Management cited cost pressures from recent acquisitions as the reason for guidance that left Wall Street wanting more from the company. With a market capitalization of less than $7 billion, SentinelOne is one of the smaller cybersecurity firms.\n\nInvestors should treat the drop in S stock as a buying opportunity.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA less obvious choice in the cybersecurity space is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). However, the company does protect businesses with advanced enterprise cybersecurity solutions that increasingly employ AI. And IBM stock looks certainly affordable, if not undervalued, trading at 19 times future earnings estimates and offering a quarterly dividend payment that yields 4%. IBM stock has also recently sold off following the company\u2019s latest earnings print, creating an opportunity for investors.\n\nIBM stock has also been affected by news that the technology giant is acquiring cloud software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion. Analysts and investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the deal. For its part, IBM says the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings in the first full year after it closes. The company hopes to finalize the acquisition by year\u2019s end. IBM also continues to roll out AI products, noting that it has armed its 160,000 consultants with AI assistants to boost productivity. IBM stock is up 4% on the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Pharma Stocks Harnessing AI Brainpower for Big Breakthroughs",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform every industry and sector,\u00a0pharma included. But how do those companies plan to leverage AI, and what will it do for their stocks? The answers, of course, are as varied as the companies leveraging AI.\n\nMany will leverage AI for the process of drug discovery. AI is much more efficient at identifying compounds with potential efficacy for a given disease or disorder. Others are utilizing AI to improve the development process for validation assays, the tests used to identify compounds. The use cases go on and on.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of how AI will affect individual pharma stocks. The answer there, too, will be varied. AI will serve to raise the prices of some stocks while others will not be so fortunate. Let\u2019s take a look at seven pharma stocks to buy that leverage AI and what investors can expect.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSchrodinger (SDGR) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nSchrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR) continues to develop its physics-based computational platform, which heavily leverages artificial intelligence. That platform is especially useful for the purpose of drug discovery, making Schrodinger one of the more prominent AI pharma stocks.\n\nThe company leverages that platform for the internal purpose of identifying potentially valid pharmaceutical candidates. In other words, Schrodinger operates its own pharma discovery arm. Meanwhile, the company also licenses that platform as a software to other firms.\n\nInvestors who\u2019ve placed their capital behind Schrodinger have gone on something of a roller coaster ride. During the most recent period, the company reported $36.6 million in revenues, $33.4 million of which came from software licensing activities. Software licensing segments improved by 3.7% during the quarter. The big decline in revenues was due to a large collaboration payment during the first quarter of 2023. Schrodinger anticipates making as much in drug discovery revenue in 2024 as it did during the first quarter of 2023.\n\nInvestors should expect its fundamentals to grow in the high single digits into the double digits. The company also has a pipeline of in-house therapeutics in development, which gives it the potential to explode in value moving forward. For those reasons, Schrodinger at least remains interesting and should be a reasonable consideration for investors.\n\nAbsci (ABSI) pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factory\n\nSource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbsci (NASDAQ:ABSI) is another firm proving that data is king across all industries in the era of artificial intelligence. The potential of ABSI stock lies in the application of generative AI to drug creation. That opportunity is really predicated on the strengths of AI in sifting through scads of data at speeds never before possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis stock itself is interesting because it represents a mix of positive catalysts and potential flags. The company has entered into a collaboration with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) for an AI-designed oncology target. That program could be worth up to $247 million in funding and milestone payments with additional royalties possible.\n\nYet, Absci continues to lose money and consistently produces a million dollars or less in revenues on a quarterly basis. The company also offered up more than 19 million shares of its stock in a public offering a few months ago. Those shares were priced at $4.50. Although such actions introduce the potential for dilution, share prices have consistently stayed above that offering price since.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), as a large pharma firm\u00a0and stock, is leveraging AI in multiple ways.\n\nIn short, Bristol-Myers Squibb is working with multiple smaller teams outside of its firm while also developing in-house capabilities. The company is working withExscientia (NASDAQ:EXAI) to accelerate the discovery of small molecule candidates. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers Squibb is concurrently collaborating with Insitro to develop disease models on which to test potential therapeutics. Then, the company is also working with Owkin to enhance clinical trial success strategies. Each of those three companies extensively leverages AI in its respective operations.\n\nEarlier this year Bristol-Myers Squibb enlisted the help of VantAI in leveraging generative AI. The firms are working together to better understand the application of molecular glues to proteins. If the project is successful, VantAI stands to reap as much as $674 million in milestone payments. Molecular glues work to bind together two or more proteins that would not normally bind. Thus, Bristol-Myers Squibb may, in time, develop totally novel treatments for diseases and disorders.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock is on many investors\u2019 radars due to the success of its weight loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nSales of those drugs continue to thrive despite supply chain issues that continue to plague the company. In short, Eli Lilly is well positioned to thrive currently on the success of its weight loss champions. The sky continues to be the limit, as the company chose to hike its sales forecast beyond Wall Street\u2019s expectations even with nagging supply chain issues.\n\nWhile that\u2019s arguably the top reason to consider investing in Eli Lilly, its AI efforts are very intriguing. Scientists at the company were particularly surprised at the ability of AI to produce potentially viable and novel therapeutics humans could not have envisioned. That was the opinion of Chief Information and Digital Officer Diogo Rau. He noted that much of the application of AI in drug discovery centers around iteratively teaching the AI how to correctly produce viable candidates.\n\nRau noted that while the structures of many of the molecules AI is producing at the firm were \u201cweird\u201d, they are also viable. That leads Rau to believe AI is set to revolutionize the types of therapeutics beyond that which humans could have envisioned in the past.\n\nNovartis (NVS) nvs stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNovartis (NYSE:NVS) is an interesting pharma stock to consider if for no other reason than it exemplifies the applicability of AI across all fields.\n\nThat truth is exemplified in the career path of the firm\u2019s current head of AI and computational sciences, Dr. Bulent Kiziltan. He started out studying black holes and ultimately found his way to Novartis. If nothing else, his decision to join Novartis is a clear indication of the potential of AI in the pharmaceutical realm.\n\nFurthermore, Novartis currently has more than 150 ongoing AI projects. The company has partnered with leading AI firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), to scale AI firm-wide.\n\nThe results from those projects will take time to materialize, and the current status of the company is strong. Novartis recently released earnings results showing 11% top-line growth and operating income that increased by 22%.\n\nThe stock represents a potent mix of strong fundamentals and strong AI-driven upside worth considering for investors.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is an interesting stock at the moment for a number of reasons. Most of those reasons can be traced back to its pandemic success and the current hangover therefrom.\n\nThe company\u2019s pandemic success is also attributable to AI.\n\nInvestors are well aware that Pfizer\u2019s shares have fallen dramatically of late. The pandemic is over, and Paxlovid sales have essentially cratered. Shares continue to trade below $30. The company is no longer capable of reaching $100 billion in annual sales. However, many investors, myself included, see great potential in the firm at this price. It certainly represents a nice income opportunity through its current high-yield dividend.\n\nDid you know that Paxlovid was developed using AI? Pfizer leveraged IBM\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) supercomputing might to successfully develop the drug. Pfizer noted that in doing so, it was able to reduce development timelines considerably. Who knows, perhaps Pfizer will successfully develop the next blockbuster drug by utilizing AI again.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the other weight loss stock dominating the pharma sector currently. It\u2019s also a company dedicating substantial resources to AI.\n\nIn March, the Novo Nordisk Foundation announced that one of the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers will be built in Denmark, the company\u2019s home base. The project is a collaboration between multiple funding organizations in the European nation and Nvidia.\n\nThe collaboration will establish a national center housing one of Nvidia\u2019s supercomputers. It will be accessible to both public and private researchers within Denmark. The project is intended to accelerate solutions to societal problems.\n\nCEO of the foundation Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen noted, \u201cDrug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment, as well as complicated life science challenges, are examples of areas where extreme AI computing power can enable the positive transformation of our society.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk will continue to be a firm to watch for its early success in commercializing weight loss drugs. That success is leading to investment that it may use to jump ahead further in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 20 Years: May 2024",
        "content": "They say the best time to invest was 20 years ago. And indeed, that\u2019s not too long after the early 2000s recession bottomed out. You\u2019d be sitting on 377% in gains if you invested in the overall market exactly 20 years back. But the second best time? Many would say the COVID trough, but I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s right now, if you know where to look.\n\nThe investing landscape right now may be better than many think, for those looking for buy-and-hold opportunities in the market. Things are surely more fast-paced these days, but 20 years gives you the chance to make the most out of what is likely to come in the future. You\u2019d have known 20 years back that the internet was going to be very big. Accordingly, we have a lot of promising tech that can be big in the next two decades\u2014but we\u2019ll be investing in them indirectly through big \u2018no-brainer\u2019 stocks to buy and hold, instead of startups that could fizzle away.\n\nThus, without further ado, here are the seven stocks I\u2019d put my money into if I were handed a crisp $10,000 bill (they actually exist \u2013 look it up)!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust when it seemed like\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) influence in the cloud sector couldn\u2019t expand any further, the company surpassed expectations once again. Azure revenue soared 23% this past quarter to eclipse $35.1 billion. And it\u2019s worth noting that arguably the entire AI revolution up until now has been indirectly orchestrated by Microsoft. OpenAI would not be where it is right now without the billions it got from Microsoft. From foundational infrastructure to cutting-edge large language models, Microsoft is\u00a0clearly\u00a0leading the way.\n\nThe data boom doesn\u2019t seem to be cooling down either. Azure\u2019s deals valued at more than $100 million increased by over 80%, while commitments over $10 million more than doubled year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 65% of Fortune 500 companies are now using Azure and/or OpenAI. Yes, MSFT stock trades at 35-times forward earnings and a tech selloff means this stock would likely decline as well. But this is a solid pick if you are holding for 20 years. I have full trust in CEO Satya Nadella, so this is definitely one of the best long-term stocks to buy and hold, in my opinion. MSFT price. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the backbone of the semiconductor industry. Most semiconductor companies supply directly from Taiwan Semi. Many analysts think the stock deserves to trade lower than its fabless peers due to the \u201cChina threat\u201d and on-shoring trends. However, this argument does not make sense to me since any impact on Taiwan Semi would surely hit fabless semiconductor companies much harder. Plus, Taiwan Semi is investing $40 billion in U.S. chip manufacturing. Its facility is expected to be operational in 2027 or 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s financial metrics remain robust.\u00a0Gross margins exceeded 53% while operating margins topped 42%. Revenue rose 16.5% year-over-year, beating estimates on both earnings and revenue. I see more upside ahead, since the premium you\u2019re paying now is historically not that high. TSM PE. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile seasonal effects dampened smartphone demand slightly in the first quarter, TSMC has done well across all areas of its business. Advanced technological nodes remain in high demand, with 3nm and 5nm processors already accounting for a sizable 46% of wafer sales. Barring unexpected disruptions, this chip giant appears well-situated to sustain its major role in the industry. Notably, TSM stock also provides a 1.7% dividend yield. So, if you like income and you want semiconductor exposure, this is one of the top stocks to buy and hold.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nIt\u2019s hard to ever be bearish on\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). This company has historically outperformed the S&P 500, and I think it is well-positioned to continue doing so. CEO Warren Buffett might be old right now and not have a right-hand man anymore. But even then, this company\u2019s portfolio is very solid.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway partially acts like an ETF, but with massive flexibility. The company can pile cash or other assets into big private companies like\u00a0BNSF Railway, taking on such investment over the years. Its biggest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has not performed well compared to other Big Tech companies, but it hasn\u2019t delivered terrible results either.\n\nI think once Apple gets its AI game on point, we should see even more bullishness spill over into Berkshire stock.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) An image showing the front of the Google Headquarters in California.\n\nSource: turtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) most recent quarterly results were very encouraging. Revenue increased 15.4% year-over-year, totaling over $80.5 billion. This continues to show the company\u2019s leading position in internet search as well as video sharing through YouTube. Revenue is also up significantly in the company\u2019s cloud computing business. GOOG revenue. stocks to buy and hold\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI really can\u2019t see Google ever being dethroned. AI has not made a dent in Google\u2019s search segment, and YouTube seems even stronger to me. You can make an alternative to Google, but you can\u2019t replace the massive amount of content on YouTube.\n\nYouTube and cloud computing revenue combined are on track to exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the year, if current growth continues. Each of the company\u2019s major business lines showed robust expansion. YouTube has restrictions on adblockers now which is helping power revenue higher. The company also beat both top and bottom-line estimates, a trend I expect to continue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) 2 Billionaires who Could Push Jeff Bezos Out of Top Spot\n\nSource: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently reported another stellar quarterly performance. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, comfortably surpassing Wall Street projections. But an even bigger highlight was its operating income, which rebounded 221% to $15.3 billion. It seems all of Amazon\u2019s ongoing efforts to streamline operations and cut costs are paying off. I believe the stock can continue climbing if the stock\u2019s premium holds up. AMZN EPS. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nInvestments in new fulfillment centers in more local regions are proving valuable, with nearly 60% of Prime orders in major U.S. metropolitan areas now arriving either the same day or the next day. Plus, with $48.8 billion in free cash flow over the last twelve months, I see a lot more room for expansion. Amazon is much more than an e-commerce business after the cloud boom, so I have solid conviction in this diversified business for the next two decades.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive.

While their revenue came in just a smidge below estimates, I\u2019d say the company\u2019s performance was rock solid across some key areas that matter a lot more. The current pullback is likely due to investors taking profits instead of concerns about\u00a0IBM\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) core business.\n\nIBM has been turning the corner, and is now quickly shifting from a mature tech cash cow to a cloud + quantum computing and software play. IBM segments. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFew on Wall Street might now associate IBM with cutting-edge tech yet, but I think that dynamic may change.\u00a0The HashiCorp acquisition is going to accelerate the process.\n\nIBM is doubling down on its hybrid multi-approach. And since Hashi\u2019s Terraform is the number one tool buildings use for their infrastructure codes, IBM\u2019s getting a great way to help more businesses get started. I think the company\u2019s recent move to link up with Red Hat makes a lot of sense too. Indeed, this deal makes IBM\u2019s entire IT assistance collection stronger.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CRSP) logo within a DNA sequence\n\nSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.com\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is by far the riskiest play on this list. If you\u2019ve been reading my articles for a long time, you\u2019d know I stay away from most biotech companies.\n\nHowever, CRISPR has been one of the rare exceptions. I\u2019ve been bullish on the stock since 2022. CRSP stock hasn\u2019t made big moves either way since, but if this\u00a0gene-editing tech does become successful, you\u2019ll be laughing your way to the bank in 20 years.\n\nThe company currently has seven trials underway studying new treatments for cancer, autoimmune conditions, heart health issues, and diabetes.

        "title": "IBM Expands Qiskit, World's Most Performant Quantum Software",
        "content": "Qiskit now refined as a comprehensive quantum software stack, focused on performance and stability to fully harness the power of utility-scale quantum hardware, and enable users to run increasingly more complex quantum circuits in the search for quantum advantage.\n\nYORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y., May 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0IBM (NYSE: IBM)\u00a0today announced the evolution and expansion of Qiskit, its globally adopted quantum software. Launched in 2017, Qiskit, as a software development kit (SDK) is an open-source tool that has allowed over 550,000 users to build and run quantum circuits on IBM's quantum hardware systems, resulting in the execution of over 3 trillion quantum circuits to date.\n\nThe latest version of Qiskit has been expanded to a comprehensive software stack to deliver even more performance. It has evolved from its beginnings as a popular quantum software development kit used to explore and run quantum computing experiments and into a stable SDK and portfolio of services, built to enable users to extract improved performance while running complex quantum circuits on 100+ qubit IBM quantum computers.\n\nThis expansion will equip members of the IBM Quantum Network with the most performant Qiskit capabilities available to discover the next generation of quantum algorithms in their respective domains: which will play an important role in their discovery of quantum advantage.\n\nTo reach quantum advantage, users need a toolset which can map their problems in a way which leverages both advanced classical and quantum computation; optimizes the problem for efficient execution with quantum; and then effectively executes the quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. IBM has spent the last seven years developing these tools, which are now coming together to comprise the Qiskit software stack.\n\nThis expansion of Qiskit includes over 100 releases from its origins as a pioneering research tool built to study the inner workings of quantum computers. Today, Qiskit has matured as a software stack on which enterprises, government organizations, research institutions, and universities are running large-scale quantum experiments.\n\nThe expanded software stack of Qiskit includes:\n\nThe stable release of Qiskit SDK v1.x for building, optimizing, and visualizing quantum circuits. AI-powered optimization of quantum circuits for quantum hardware, embedded in the Qiskit Transpiler Service.  Simplified execution modes for the Qiskit Runtime Service which can be tailored for performant execution of quantum circuits on quantum hardware. The Qiskit Code Assistant, powered by watsonx-based generative AI models, to automate the development of quantum code The Qiskit Serverless open-source tool to run quantum-centric supercomputing workloads across quantum hardware and classical clusters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe deployment of new capabilities and improvements within Qiskit SDK are enabling users to optimize circuits for quantum hardware at a rate 39 times faster than Qiskit 0.331. Qiskit also is engineered to reduce the overhead and shrink the footprint of circuits, demonstrating an average of 3 times reduction in memory usage compared to Qiskit 0.43.2\n\nAnd using the Qiskit Transpiler Service, users can reduce circuit depth by combining AI and heuristic passes, compared to using the Qiskit SDK without AI optimization.\n\n\"The global adoption of quantum computing \u2014 and the discovery of quantum advantage \u2014 will require a combination of leading quantum hardware alongside a robust and performant software stack to run workloads,\" said Jay Gambetta, IBM Fellow and Vice President, IBM Quantum. \"These two pillars are fundamental to the algorithm discovery that has begun on utility-scale quantum hardware. As a growing quantum ecosystem maps their most difficult problems to quantum circuits, the Qiskit stack will be the cornerstone to exploring the computational spaces in which quantum computing excels.\"\n\nIBM first demonstrated the utility-scale capabilities of its quantum hardware in 2023. This signaled the start of an era in which quantum hardware can run quantum circuits faster and more accurately than a classical computer simulating a quantum computer can. Now built to maximize the performance of advanced quantum hardware, the Qiskit software stack aims to help a global ecosystem of users discover new quantum algorithms that explore where quantum computers could be the best way to solve challenges over any classical method.\n\n\"Qiskit provides an important collection of tools for E.ON as we explore how quantum computing could help us navigate the financial and operational complexities of the energy industry,\" said Giorgio Cortiana, Head of Data and AI - Energy Intelligence, E.ON. \"As a performant foundation to build and discover quantum algorithms that can be applied to business use cases, Qiskit enables our team to advance utility-scale prototypes, with the goal of finding new solutions to challenges in the European energy sector.\"\n\n\"We started using Qiskit for our quantum computing efforts several years ago as part of an effort to help develop a quantum-ready workforce,\" said Stephan Eidenbenz, senior scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. \"Laboratory researchers use Qiskit daily to interact with IBM's quantum hardware backends and to test new algorithmic ideas. The open nature of Qiskit also offers our team the ability to add compiler optimization passes and allows pulse-level access.\"\n\n\"At Brookhaven, we have used Qiskit to execute circuits on IBM's quantum hardware, which has resulted in almost 20 published papers to date, including exploring the frontiers of physics, dynamic systems, condensed matter systems, and more.

        "title": "AI Battle Ahead: Why Palantir Stock Faces a Tough Road in 2025",
        "content": "PalantirTechnologies (NYSE:PLTR) first-quarter results show that the company\u2019s revenue and customer base are growing rapidly. Still, PLTR\u2019s profits remain quite low considering the company\u2019s high-flying stock. And the company continues to face multiple, strong, worrisome threats. Moreover, the Street appears to have lost its love for Palantir stock. In light of these points, I continue to urge investors to unload the company\u2019s shares.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth Paired With Continued, Relatively Low Profits\n\nIn the first quarter, the company\u2019s revenue climbed 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its customer count jumped an impressive 42% year-over-year (YOY). And the increase of both of those metrics also accelerated compared to Q4, when its top line and customer base rose by 19.6% YOY and 32% YOY, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Palantir\u2019s sales from U.S. companies increased 40% YOY, down from the 70% YOY increase in that area in Q4. I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a minute.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the profit side, the company\u2019s Q1 operating income (OI) came in at $81 million. That represents a large increase, in percentage terms, compared with the $4.1 million of OI that the firm generated in Q1 of 2023.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that the $81 million of OI equates to $324 million on an annualized basis. And since the market capitalization of Palantir stock is $46.5 billion, the name is changing hands at a huge, annualized OI-to-price ratio of 143.5 times.\n\nPalantir Is Facing Multiple Tough Threats\n\nPalantir\u2019s claim to fame and biggest growth engine is the company\u2019s software that helps firms and government agencies easily deploy and manage AI tools. But as I\u2019ve pointed out in past columns, numerous companies, including IBM (NYSE:IBM), C3.ai (NYSE:AI), and Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) have developed similar software. And three powerhouses \u2014 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) \u2014 are working together to help firms deploy AI systems.\n\nSo Palantir has a huge amount of competition with which to contend on the AI front. That increasing competition is probably one major factor that caused the YOY increase in its overall revenue from the U.S. private sector to fall to 40% last quarter from 70% in Q4 of 2023.\n\nAnother threat facing Palantir is cost-cutting by the U.S. federal government. Whether President Trump or President Biden wins a second term, Washington is going to have to get serious about cutting costs starting next year. That\u2019s because interest on the federal debt alone now equals 40% of personal income taxes collected. And with interest rates high and debt rising, that situation will only become more catastrophic as the years go by.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, either Trump and Biden will be lame ducks who cannot run for another term. That makes this a good opportunity for the political parties to finally reduce federal spending. I expect Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement that will rely primarily on reducing Social Security and Medicare spending for future beneficiaries to cut the deficit. I think they will have to make some cuts in other areas to say groups besides future middle-class retirees are sacrificing. As a result, Congress could meaningfully cut federal agencies\u2019 IT budgets. S uch a decision could significantly hurt Palantir, which gets a large chunk of its revenue from Washington.\n\nThe Street Is Becoming Less Enamored With Palantir Stock\n\nBarron\u2019s noted that, although the Street analysts were \u201cgenerally positive\u201d about Q1 results, most think that the valuation of Palantir stock is \u201cdemanding.\u201d Also, two major banks \u2014 Citi and Japan\u2019s Mizuho \u2014 kept \u201cneutral\u201d ratings on the shares, while investment bank William Blair maintained an \u201cunderperform\u201d rating on the name.\n\nIn another indication that the Street is less thrilled with Palantir than it once was, the name sank 21% between May 6, the day that it reported its Q1 results, and the market close on May 13.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer\u2019s wife held a long position in NOW. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Cisco, International Business Machines, HashiCorp, Hewlett Packard and Juniper Networks",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, HashiCorp Inc. HCP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE and Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 Tech Acquisitions YTD Likely to Reshape Sector Dynamics\n\nIn a concerted effort to thwart the growing menace of cyberattacks and strengthen cyber resiliency, technology companies are increasingly investing in a comprehensive suite of modernized cloud security and compliance solutions. These solutions are specifically designed to assist enterprises in mitigating risk and safeguarding their data across hybrid, multi-cloud environments and workloads.\n\nLeveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation techniques, these solutions bring together human expertise and advanced technologies for faster response, efficiency and transparency through a holistic approach to secure hybrid cloud environments. Moreover, a higher demand for data computing at the edge, triggered by the rapid deployment of 5G and the proliferation of IoT devices, has forced tech firms to ensure their resiliency, performance, security and compliance standards.\n\nIn addition to organic growth, technology firms are gradually leaning toward the inorganic route to bolster their cybersecurity domain. The merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy heralds a new era of innovation in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. As the companies join forces, their complementary strengths are poised to reshape the industry landscape, delivering enhanced value to customers and stakeholders alike.\n\nLet us delve a little deep for a brief analysis of three such notable transactions in 2024 to get an essence of the sector developments.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. acquired Splunk Inc. in March in a transaction valued at $28 billion. Splunk's expertise in advanced AI-powered solutions stands to greatly enhance Cisco's AI-driven service offerings. By leveraging Splunk's capabilities, Cisco aims to accelerate the development of next-generation solutions, optimizing data value and reinforcing security analytics.\n\nThis strategic alignment reflects industry trends, where the convergence of cybersecurity and AI is increasingly paramount. As organizations navigate complex digital ecosystems, the demand for AI-driven security solutions continues to surge. By integrating Splunk's cutting-edge technologies, Cisco strengthens its position as a formidable player in this evolving landscape, poised to deliver innovative solutions tailored to meet evolving customer needs.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom Splunk's perspective, the merger represents a significant win-win scenario. It provides access to Cisco's robust resources and global reach, facilitating accelerated research and development initiatives. Moreover, the collaboration positions Splunk at the forefront of AI innovation, enabling the creation of synergistic solutions that address the evolving cybersecurity challenges faced by enterprises worldwide.\n\nIn April, International Business Machines Corp. inked an agreement to acquire HashiCorp Inc. Based in California, HashiCorp is a software company that enables organizations to efficiently automate multi-cloud and hybrid environments with its Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management solutions.\n\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and highly interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. IBM\u2019s acquisition of HCP is a probable ploy to address these issues.\n\nRepresenting an enterprise value of $6.4 billion, the deal will significantly augment IBM\u2019s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. Moreover, HashiCorp\u2019s tool sets will likely complement IBM RedHat\u2019s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management. The integration of HCP\u2019s cloud software capabilities will bolster IBM\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud approach.\n\nEarlier, in January, Hewlett Packard Enterprise inked a definitive agreement to acquire Juniper Networks, Inc. in an all-cash transaction for $40.00 per share, representing an equity value of approximately $14 billion.\n\nJuniper offers an extensive array of routing, switching and network security solutions. The company specializes in developing products that facilitate building network infrastructure used for services and applications based on a single Internet protocol network worldwide. Juniper also boasts a solid AI portfolio. Juniper AIOps (AI for IT Operations) leverages machine learning capabilities in conjunction with data science to streamline enterprise operations across wireless access, wired access and security domains.\n\nHPE stands as a key player in the server and hardware storage sectors and a prominent cloud service provider. The company is actively seeking to diversify its revenue sources and views AI as the next major market. Hewlett Packard is strategically focusing on expanding its generative AI offerings to tap the growing opportunities in this domain. The acquisition of Juniper is a significant stride in that direction.\n\nIntegration of Juniper\u2019s AI and cloud portfolio will serve as a valuable enhancement to HPE\u2019s portfolio. The acquisition is likely to double HPE\u2019s networking business with a comprehensive product bouquet. The combined entity will amplify HPE\u2019s edge-to-cloud strategy with an ability to lead in an AI-native environment based on a foundational cloud-native architecture. Leveraging industry-leading AI, the combined company will offer the networking architecture necessary to manage and simplify the increasingly complex connectivity needs for superior user experiences.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Warren Buffet\u2019s Blunders: 3 Investments Even the Oracle Regrets",
        "content": "Warren Buffett might be the greatest investor of all time, but he\u2019s not immune from making mistakes. This was on full display at the recent Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) annual meeting, where Buffett disclosed that he had sold the company\u2019s entire stake in Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) at a substantial loss.\n\nAlthough the exact loss wasn\u2019t disclosed, Buffett said: \u201cI was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision. It was 100% my decision, and we\u2019ve sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money.\u201d The Paramount blunder is the latest bad investment that Buffett has made in the course of a career that spans more than 50 years. What\u2019s nice about Buffett is that he is quick to admit a mistake, correct it, and share what he has learned.\n\nDespite his overall track record of success, Buffett is human like the rest of us and prone to bad decisions when it comes to stocks. Here is Warren Buffet\u2019s blunders: three investments even the Oracle regrets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nThroughout much of his career, Buffett has been criticized for not investing in high-growth technology stocks. He has admitted that his avoidance of the tech sector has cost Berkshire Hathaway and its shareholders some big gains. Buffett still chastises himself for not investing in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The Oracle of Omaha has made up some ground in this area by going all in on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThough he recently trimmed his position in AAPL stock, it remains Berkshire\u2019s biggest position, accounting for 40% of the equity portfolio. However, before he started buying Apple shares in earnest during 2018, Buffett made a costly bet on legacy tech firm IBM (NYSE:IBM). In November 2011, Buffett bought 64 million shares of IBM at an average price of $170, giving Berkshire a $10.7 billion stake in the tech giant.\n\nSeven years later, Buffett sold the entire IBM holding after enduring six years of mounting sales declines and watching as the stock\u2019s price fell to $140 a share. This led to Berkshire incurring a nearly 20% loss on its IBM investment. Fortunately for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett quickly pivoted from IBM to Apple, and the rest is history.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Statue of Disney's (DIS) Mickey Mouse in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com\n\nParamount Global isn\u2019t the first entertainment stock that Buffett counts as an investment blunder. Early in his career, Buffett made a huge mistake by selling his holding in Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS). Back in 1966, Buffett met with Walt Disney himself, who was then expanding the Disneyland theme park in California. At the time, Disney was known for its one theme park and a couple dozen animated movies. Sentiment towards DIS stock on Wall Street was indifferent.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett apparently liked Walt Disney and the company\u2019s pristine balance sheet. He took a 5% stake in the company, buying $4 million of DIS stock. A year later, Buffett sold his entire stake in Disney for $6 million, netting a 50% ($2 million) profit. The Disney investment may have been profitable, but Buffett earned peanuts compared to what he would have made had he held on. Today, Buffett\u2019s 5% stake in Disney would be worth $10 billion based on the current share price.\n\nBuffett also would have earned more than $1 billion worth of dividend payments over the years had he let DIS stock ride. Maybe this is why Buffett now says his \u201cfavorite holding period is forever.\u201d\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) Oil Stocks ConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nThe price someone pays for a stock matters. Buying at the top of the market is never a good idea. Yet that is the mistake Buffett made in 2008 when he bought a big stake in oil and natural gas producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Buffett bought 79.9 million shares of ConocoPhillips when crude oil prices were trading near $100 a barrel. It turned out to be the peak for energy prices.\n\nCrude oil fell amid the 2008/09 financial crisis and COP stock fell alongside it. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway ended up reporting a $1.5-billion loss for the first-quarter of 2009 as it wrote down its ConocoPhillips investment. At the time, it was the biggest quarterly loss in Berkshire\u2019s history. Buffett called the investment a major mistake and swiftly sold 40% of the ConocoPhillips holding. By 2013, Buffett had completely exited COP stock.\n\nIn this case, Buffett appears to have gotten caught up in an energy rally that took place in 2007 and 2008. Buffett has had a love/hate relationship with oil stocks throughout his career, praising their valuations while complaining about the volatility in energy markets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks to sell might seem odd, especially in a year with rising corporate earnings, a U.S. presidential election and possibly three rate cuts. However, stock investors must stay watchful, especially with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average up 10% and 4.7%, respectively, far from a bull run.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts expect poor global growth, inflation and geopolitical concerns to hurt the stock market this year. Analysts think a worldwide recession is possible, but high interest rates and geopolitical upheavals make them skeptical of riskier ventures.\n\nElections in 2024 make things even less assured. This year started better than most election years, which could imply better things throughout the year, but you will never know which way the stock markets will react to the election, which is why looking for blue-chip stocks to sell is important.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is up against tough competition in the tech industry, especially when it comes to cloud services and AI systems. Sales went up just 1.47% in Q1 2024, less than the average 10% growth managed by competitors.\n\nEven though the company is trying to change its business plan, its legacy IT services segment is still hurting its overall performance, leading to sluggish capital appreciation of around 30%. For context, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed Friday at around $898, a 210% one-year gain.\n\nTo streamline its business operations, IBM laid off many people in its marketing and communications departments earlier this year, saving the company $3 billion a year by the end of 2024.\n\nArvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, is now focusing on upskilling workers with the latest AI-focused skills. IBM will replace over 8,000 roles as it starts to scale operations through automation and digital intelligence.\n\nKrishna is notable for acknowledging the fact that IBM, though entering the AI race early lost its way a bit. In an interview with CNBC, he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a fair criticism, that we were slow to monetize and slow to make really consumable the learnings from Watson winning Jeopardy.\u201d\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) xom insider buying\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil\u2018s (NYSE:XOM) earnings fell across all of its business groups in the first quarter of 2024 due to lower industry refining margins and unfavorable timing effects, especially from derivative mark-to-market impacts, which contributed to this decline.\n\nAnother recent issue is Exxon\u2019s dropping its lawsuit against Santa Barbara County for not obtaining permission to carry oil from offshore installations. According to environmental groups, moving crude oil through sensitive areas could cause oil spills and traffic accidents. Apart from the ecological damage, substantial legal losses can also occur.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother concern is that ExxonMobil intends to search for oil and gas in Guyana and Venezuela\u2019s claimed South American shoreline. Because both countries claim the land, the proposal has raised geopolitical and natural concerns.\n\nFinally, ExxonMobil and other oil firms are also criticized for global carbon emissions. Countries like Guyana, where ExxonMobil is active, use their forests to balance out their emissions while still making oil. As the younger generation becomes more ESG-conscious, such issues can lead to issues for XOM stock in the future.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock. Blue-chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is down over 35% this year, thanks to narrowing its fiscal year 2024 and slashing its dividend 48%, amid a tough retail environment.\n\nWBA reported a net loss of $67 million in the first quarter, less than the $3.7 billion loss in the same quarter the previous year, but this gain was due to the fact that there wasn\u2019t a big pre-tax charge for opioid-related lawsuits and claims that had changed the numbers from the previous year.\n\nBoots\u2019 retail sales in the UK did really well. Compared to the same quarter last year, pharmacy sales went up 0.8% and retail sales went up 9.8%. Boots.com\u2019s sales went up by 17.5%, which made it stand out. These sales now make up more than 19% of all sales at Boots.\n\nBut in the U.S., the healthcare segment made $1.9 billion in sales, with the VillageMD purchase of Summit Health being the driving factor. In the end, the segment reported an operating loss, which is bad news for Walgreens in a key segment.\n\nThe results come shortly after S&P Global Ratings downgraded Walgreens, saying that recent changes in management, such as the CEO and CFO, put the company\u2019s healthcare business at risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "3 Tech Acquisitions YTD Likely to Reshape Sector Dynamics",
        "content": "In a concerted effort to thwart the growing menace of cyberattacks and strengthen cyber resiliency, technology companies are increasingly investing in a comprehensive suite of modernized cloud security and compliance solutions. These solutions are specifically designed to assist enterprises in mitigating risk and safeguarding their data across hybrid, multi-cloud environments and workloads.\r\n\r\nLeveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation techniques, these solutions bring together human expertise and advanced technologies for faster response, efficiency and transparency through a holistic approach to secure hybrid cloud environments. Moreover, a higher demand for data computing at the edge, triggered by the rapid deployment of 5G and the proliferation of IoT devices, has forced tech firms to ensure their resiliency, performance, security and compliance standards.\r\n\r\nIn addition to organic growth, technology firms are gradually leaning toward the inorganic route to bolster their cybersecurity domain. The merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy heralds a new era of innovation in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. As the companies join forces, their complementary strengths are poised to reshape the industry landscape, delivering enhanced value to customers and stakeholders alike.\r\n\r\nLet us delve a little deep for a brief analysis of three such notable transactions in 2024 to get an essence of the sector developments.\r\n\r\nCisco Systems Inc. CSCO acquired Splunk Inc. in March in a transaction valued at $28 billion. Splunk's expertise in advanced AI-powered solutions stands to greatly enhance Cisco's AI-driven service offerings. By leveraging Splunk's capabilities, Cisco aims to accelerate the development of next-generation solutions, optimizing data value and reinforcing security analytics.\r\n\r\nThis strategic alignment reflects industry trends, where the convergence of cybersecurity and AI is increasingly paramount. As organizations navigate complex digital ecosystems, the demand for AI-driven security solutions continues to surge. By integrating Splunk's cutting-edge technologies, Cisco strengthens its position as a formidable player in this evolving landscape, poised to deliver innovative solutions tailored to meet evolving customer needs.\r\n\r\nFrom Splunk's perspective, the merger represents a significant win-win scenario. It provides access to Cisco's robust resources and global reach, facilitating accelerated research and development initiatives. Moreover, the collaboration positions Splunk at the forefront of AI innovation, enabling the creation of synergistic solutions that address the evolving cybersecurity challenges faced by enterprises worldwide.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn April, International Business Machines Corporation IBM inked an agreement to acquire HashiCorp Inc. HCP. Based in California, HashiCorp is a software company that enables organizations to efficiently automate multi-cloud and hybrid environments with its Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management solutions.\r\n\r\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and highly interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. IBM\u2019s acquisition of HCP is a probable ploy to address these issues.\r\n\r\nRepresenting an enterprise value of $6.4 billion, the deal will significantly augment IBM\u2019s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. Moreover, HashiCorp\u2019s tool sets will likely complement IBM RedHat\u2019s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management. The integration of HCP\u2019s cloud software capabilities will bolster IBM\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud approach. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarlier, in January, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE inked a definitive agreement to acquire Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR in an all-cash transaction for $40.00 per share, representing an equity value of approximately $14 billion.\r\n\r\nJuniper offers an extensive array of routing, switching and network security solutions. The company specializes in developing products that facilitate building network infrastructure used for services and applications based on a single Internet protocol network worldwide. Juniper also boasts a solid AI portfolio. Juniper AIOps (AI for IT Operations) leverages machine learning capabilities in conjunction with data science to streamline enterprise operations across wireless access, wired access and security domains.\r\n\r\nHPE stands as a key player in the server and hardware storage sectors and a prominent cloud service provider. The company is actively seeking to diversify its revenue sources and views AI as the next major market. Hewlett Packard is strategically focusing on expanding its generative AI offerings to tap the growing opportunities in this domain. The acquisition of Juniper is a significant stride in that direction.\r\n\r\nIntegration of Juniper\u2019s AI and cloud portfolio will serve as a valuable enhancement to HPE\u2019s portfolio. The acquisition is likely to double HPE\u2019s networking business with a comprehensive product bouquet. The combined entity will amplify HPE\u2019s edge-to-cloud strategy with an ability to lead in an AI-native environment based on a foundational cloud-native architecture. Leveraging industry-leading AI, the combined company will offer the networking architecture necessary to manage and simplify the increasingly complex connectivity needs for superior user experiences.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 high-paying entry-level jobs in the US. We have also talked about the struggles of finding entry-levels jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 High-Paying Entry-Level Jobs in the US.\n\nEntry-level jobs, traditionally seen as roles that require minimal prior experience or skills, now appear to demand a laundry list of qualifications. From requiring years of experience to demanding mastery of various skills like graphic design, SEO, and copywriting, the expectations can feel overwhelming. Even advanced degrees are listed as preferred qualifications for entry-level positions which adds to the frustration.\n\nThis frustration is not unfounded. Studies have shown that 42% of job seekers feel excluded from opportunities due to a lack of formal qualifications or experience. In fact, nearly half of employees report feeling this way, according to a 2023 report. Another barrier cited is the lack of relevant skills or credentials, as highlighted by a 2022 report. The emphasis on skills-based hiring has become more pronounced as employers prioritize experience and abilities over degrees.\n\nHowever, there's a shift in hiring trends as fewer human resources leaders are focusing on entry-level positions compared to previous years. This trend suggests a growing preference for experienced candidates over those just starting their careers. One explanation for this could be the gap in skills and training, with employers increasingly seeking external hires rather than investing in internal talent development.\n\nSpeaking of the skill-gap, it is concerning to note that the manufacturing industry in the United States is observing a skills gap that could result in 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030, according to a study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The projected cost of these vacancies would amount to $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nMoreover, despite the industry's efforts to rebound from the pandemic-induced setbacks, the shortage of skilled labor persists. Although 63% of the jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, approximately 570,000 positions remained unfulfilled as of the end of 2020. Manufacturers are struggling with a 36% increase in the difficulty of finding a suitable workforce.\n\nBeyond the manufacturing industry, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is stepping up to address the increasing skills gap in artificial intelligence (AI) by committing to training 2 million individuals over the next three years. With projections from the World Economic Forum indicating that 1.1 billion jobs will face the wrath of automation due to AI in the next decade, and over 82% of business leaders recognizing the need for new skills, the urgency to bridge this gap is palpable.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s platform, SkillsBuild, offers over 1,000 courses that cover both hard and soft skills and are accessible to learners of all ages and backgrounds. What sets SkillsBuild apart is its customization and translation across multiple languages.\n\nMoreover, by partnering with historically Black colleges and universities to establish cybersecurity leadership centers and expanding training opportunities for teachers globally, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) aims to ensure inclusivity and diversity in AI education. Additionally, by eliminating four-year degree requirements for half of its US jobs, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) exemplifies a \"skills-first agenda\u201d.\n\nApart from hard skills, companies like Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) tend to equally focus on softer skills as well. For example, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u2019s\u00a0 training program for store managers has a focus on compassionate leadership and effective communication. Each year, approximately 2,000 managers participate in the Manager Academy at Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. These managers oversee multimillion-dollar operations, with a direct impact on Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u2019s annual revenue, which reached $648.1 billion globally last year. The training sessions focus on instilling Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u2019s core values and expectations of leadership while stressing the importance of prioritizing employees and the communities they serve. 20 High-Paying Entry-Level Jobs in the US\n\nCopyright: andresr / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the high-paying entry-level jobs in the US, we targeted jobs with low experience requirements and jobs with limited responsibilities.

If you wish to skip our analysis of digital education and demand for TEFL courses, please proceed to The 5 Best Online TEFL Courses to Get You Teaching ASAP.\n\nDigital Education\n\nThere has been a significant boom in the digital education market over the past few years. As of 2023, Global Newswire reports that the digital education market stood at a valuation of $19.2 billion. However, the industry is expected to snowball towards a size of $95.7 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 25.8%. The reason the industry saw a significant boost in 2020 was due to lock-down restrictions all over the world. The UN revealed that nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries were adversely affected due to the coronavirus-related restrictions. As the pandemic continued to linger on, people turned to online courses in an effort to improve their skills, stay busy, or transition towards alternative incomes.\n\nSimilarly, business organizations began enrolling their employees in online courses as an alternative to conventional training seminars. Thus, online education became a vital tool for major organizations to motivate staff and increase their efficiency as remote employees. Just weeks into the pandemic, online education platforms began reporting significant surges in enrollment and completion of online courses. On 30th April 2020, Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY) reported a 425% increase in enrollments on its platforms, along with an 80% increase in usage from businesses and governments.\n\n\u201cThe trends we\u2019ve seen over the last two months represent a significant acceleration in the transformation to a new Future of Work.\u201d\n\n- Darren Shimkus, Former President, Udemy for Business, Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY)\n\nIncreased enrollments fueled the recognition of online courses and certifications around the globe. In its 2021 Impact Report, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) revealed it had achieved over 200% growth in enrollment of entry-level professional certificates. Some of the entry-level certifications offered by Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) were developed in partnership with Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), enabling individuals with limited educational backgrounds to develop the competencies necessary to work in the biggest organizations on the planet.\n\nPost-pandemic, digital education is expected to continue spearheading innovation in the education sector. One notable segment in this market is that of English language learning. According to Research and Markets, the global market for English Language Learning was estimated at $21.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a size of $70.7 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 16.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTEFL Courses\n\nApart from other benefits such as ease of communication and improved learning capabilities, English language courses can be a gateway for new career opportunities. TEFL, or Teach English as a Foreign Language, is one such credential that can help open new doors. TEFL is an internationally recognized certification that certifies an individual\u2019s competency to teach English to non-native speakers.\n\nDemand for TEFL courses can be gauged by the fact that many notable digital education companies and edtech organizations have introduced the certification on their platforms in the last few years. In April 2023, edX, a leading global online learning platform from 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU) partnered to launch a new TEFL professional certificate program for edX users. Our article on Best Online Degree Programs For Working Adults highlights how 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU) is one of the most significant names in the EdTech industry.\n\n\"We look forward to providing edX learners with the ability to gain a valuable certification with The TEFL Org and to go on and create a positive impact in the lives of those they teach.\"\n\n-Andrew Hermalyn, President, Degree Support, 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU)\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about what is the most accredited TEFL course, join us as we look at the best online TEFL courses to get you teaching ASAP.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best dividend stocks that are undervalued and have just raised their payouts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend and value stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued Stocks That Just Raised Their Dividends.\n\nDividend stocks didn\u2019t perform well in 2023. However, this apparent setback has actually created favorable opportunities for long-term investors to identify undervalued stocks. Analysts also suggest piling into undervalued equities as these stocks have the potential to offer higher returns in the long run. Morningstar Chief US Market Strategist David Sekera also highlighted the same investment strategy in his second-quarter 2024 stock market outlook. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cIn our view, it is unlikely that what has worked for the last year and a half will be what continues to work. \u00a0We think now is a good time for investors to look for contrarian investment opportunities, especially in those areas that have underperformed, are unloved\u2014and most importantly\u2014undervalued.\u201d\n\nUndervalued stocks are those that are trading below their intrinsic value. This means that the market price of these stocks does not truly reflect their worth. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks can be a good opportunity for investors as these equities provide a steady income stream even if the stock price doesn\u2019t immediately appreciate. In addition to this, value stocks have shown strong performance over growth stocks over time. Studies conducted by Josef Lakonishok, a former finance professor at the University of Illinois, and David Dreman, a renowned expert in value investing, have highlighted that value stocks typically offer higher dividend yields and exhibit stronger fundamental ratios compared to high-flying growth stocks, as we reported in our article 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Their research indicated that value investing outpaces growth around 70% of the time, irrespective of the companies\u2019 sizes. Across different company sizes, their analysis consistently demonstrated that value stocks yield average returns of a little over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.\n\nDespite the underperformance of dividend stocks in 2023, companies worldwide are steadily raising their dividend payouts as a strategy to draw investor interest. Global dividend growth has consistently shown an upward trend over the past years, especially after the pandemic of 2020. According to a report by Janus Henderson Investors, global dividends grew from $1.24 trillion in 2017 to $1.66 trillion in 2023. Moreover, the figure is expected to reach $1.72 trillion this year. The dividend outlook for European companies is also promising, as they are expected to distribute \u20ac620 billion ($667 billion) to shareholders this year, marking a decade-high level of returns, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

        "content": "You know artificial intelligence (AI) is reaching the mania stage when the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) headlines appear. However, many of the headlines don\u2019t tell you to avoid AI stocks. Rather, they want to make sure that you don\u2019t limit your focus to stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and miss out on some under-the-radar AI stocks.\n\nThe skeptic in you may believe these experts have an agenda. They may, but investing isn\u2019t about certainty. It\u2019s about making educated guesses. That\u2019s particularly true of AI.\n\nEarnings season has a way of providing clarity. As companies report, investors get a better sense of companies that are turning AI into earnings. And, they can see stocks that are overhyped. But with so many names to choose from, it\u2019s\u00a0hard to keep on top of all the opportunities in this fast-moving sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese quiet performers, or under-the-radar AI stocks, have the potential for massive gains with a modest investment.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Person holding cellphone with website of US analytics company Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCathie Wood is fond of Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), whose forward P/E ratio is over 133x. However, objectively overvalued doesn\u2019t mean a stock can\u2019t be flying under the radar. That\u2019s may be the case with Palantir.\n\nPLTR stock dropped over 12% despite delivering an earnings report in which the company \u201ccrushed it\u201d in the U.S. according to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alex Karp. Revenue was up both sequentially and year-over-year (YOY) as were earnings. And, although earnings were \u201conly\u201d in-line with analysts\u2019 estimates, it was still the largest quarterly profit in the company\u2019s history.\n\nPlus, the company continues to grow both the commercial (40%) and the government (16%) arms of its business. After a year in which the company had over 50% growth in the commercial division, the 40% seems concerning. But it shouldn\u2019t be. This is still strong growth.\n\nMoreover, Palantir has true believers such as Wood who bought 1.35 million of PLTR stock after the dip. And, it has a committee army of retail investors. It also has its naysayers. Those traders took their profits after earnings, but with the stock trading around $21 after earnings, there\u2019s plenty of upside for long-term investors.\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) Brookfield Infrastructure logo on a phone screen in front of a blurred computer screen. BIPC stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of the term \u201cpicks and shovels stock.\u201d Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) presents investors with a different way to invest in the growth of AI. A better way to describe BIP is as a company that buys the picks and the shovels.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, the master limited partnership (MLP)\u00a0owns and operates critical global infrastructure networks. And in 2023 and 2024, the company has been investing substantial amounts in data centers, the are the backbone of AI. Also, Brookfield has invested in semiconductor fabrication facilities as part of its commitment to the sector.\n\nThat should catch the attention of investors who may think of BIP stock more akin to a utility stock than an AI stock. Yet, investors still get a stock with a forward P/E of just 9.2x and a dividend with a current yield of 5.33%.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nBefore you think about IBM (NYSE:IBM) as one of the under-the-radar AI stocks, the company has to be on your radar as a practical AI investment. Even IBM\u2019s CEO Arvind Krishna acknowledges that the company\u2019s AI story is still \u201cin the early innings.\u201d But Krishna also believes that the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect the potential of AI. If that\u2019s true, then now is the right time to consider IBM stock.\n\nIBM was one of the first companies to experiment with machine learning and AI. You may remember Deep Blue that beat Garry Kasparov, the chess world champion, in 1997. Today, IBM has Watsonx, a cloud-based data analysis studio, that helps enterprise customers make use of powerful generative AI tools using the company\u2019s own business data.\n\nAdmittedly, the company may only have a limited time in which to start adding customers and winning over investors. But at just 17x forward earnings and with a dividend that yields 3.91%, it might be worth taking a chance on the evolving and adaptable IBM.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR.

Researchers have been using advanced AI models to understand disease mechanisms even before the recent surge in interest.\n\nWednesday, researchers at\u00a0Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind developed\u00a0AlphaFold 3, a new\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI) model.\n\nAlphaFold\u00a03\u00a0can predict the structure and interactions of biological molecules.\u00a0This\u00a0includes proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules that\u00a0could function as drugs.\n\nAccording to the latest McKinsey Global Institute report, AI technology could generate\u00a0$60 billion\u2014$110 billion annually in economic value for the pharmaceutical industry, as it can help speed up the process of identifying compounds, their development, and approval.\n\nThe report adds that generative\u00a0AI\u2019s impact on pharmaceuticals\u00a0is expected\u00a0to be profound as the foundational models\u00a0are built\u00a0on languages, images, omics, patient information, and other types of data that come together to explain and solve the disease process and effective treatment ways.\n\nIncreased drug discovery, approval, and marketing speed can help companies resolve the asset life cycle compression issue, which is the diminishing amount of time companies have to capture the value of the new drug.\n\nMcKinsey\u2019s research shows that the time has decreased to 9.8 years from 11.7 years over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite the speedy discovery, the average cost of discovering and developing new drugs has increased.\n\nGenerative AI using augmented foundational models can help accelerate pharma research, with drug discovery timelines cut by almost half. AI tech can have a potential economic value of $15 billion-$28 billion on research and discovery.\n\nThe report notes that, on average, ten years and around $1.4 billion are needed to bring one new drug to the market, of which 80%\u00a0is\u00a0associated\u00a0with clinical development.\n\nGenerative AI addresses pain points by increasing efficiency across\u00a0the clinical development process,\u00a0unlocking the economic value of $13 billion to $25 billion.\n\nGenerative\u00a0AI tools can deepen relationships between care providers, pharmacists, insurers, and patients\u00a0to\u00a0fine-tune campaign strategies in\u00a0real time, per the report.\n\nPharma professionals and patients will have substantial data to make faster, smarter decisions, providing a potential opportunity of $18 billion to $30 billion.\n\nIn 2023, the\u00a0World Health Organization unveiled a comprehensive publication highlighting critical regulatory considerations for harnessing the potential of\u00a0AI in healthcare.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn April,\u00a0Bayer AG (OTC:BAYRY)\u00a0and\u00a0Google Cloud announced a\u00a0collaboration\u00a0to develop AI solutions to support radiologists.\n\nKey players shaping the market\u00a0include industry giants such as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Google, General Electric Co (NYSE:GE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Amazon Web Services, and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World.\n\n\"NVIDIA Has to Keep Working\"\n\nOn May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment.\n\nThe interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including,\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),\u00a0 held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -10.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 11.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share, indicating a change of +0.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $9.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. This estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.39 indicates a change of +4.7% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.63 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.18 billion and $66.23 billion estimates indicate +2.1% and +4.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have bid up quite a bit over the past year as investors have rushed to bet on the revolutionary new technology. Generative AI remains a profound technology today, as it did during the early days of the AI-fuelled stock rally. Still, AI is one of those technologies that stand to get exponentially better over time. And the technology is improving, even if shares of the top innovators begin going sideways or lower.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too long before we were all amazed by ChatGPT 4. Nowadays, many of us may have taken the large language model (LLM) for granted. It\u2019s still a powerful technology, but the honeymoon period seems to have long faded.\n\nMany of us are ready for the GPT-5 or OpenAI\u2019s text-to-video generator Sora. Others have jumped ship to other LLM offerings on the market, some of which may outperform GPT-4 on certain criteria. As the momentum behind AI stocks cools and ChatGPT hype fades further, you may get a second chance to pick up shares of undervalued AI stocks that could gain substantially in the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been consolidating over the past few months as investors ponder whether the firm has another blockbuster earnings blowout up its sleeves. Undoubtedly, the last quarter will be tough to top as the GPU juggernaut announces its results on May 22, 2024, at the market\u2019s close.\n\nStill, demand for top AI hardware is not slowing down. However, as an NVDA stockholder in the weeks leading up to earnings, one can\u2019t help but feel jittery. At just 37.45 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I still view NVDA stock as a pretty good deal despite high expectations.\n\nYou\u2019re getting a world-class AI chip maker at a multiple that I don\u2019t consider out of this world. Pending a devastating, unforeseen downward shift in chip demand, I think NVDA shareholders have plenty of reason to hang in for the ride. Blackwell B200 GPUs could power the stock in the near future, and at a later date, Nvidia will likely have a newer chip that blows Blackwell out of the water.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) doesn\u2019t get enough credit for its AI innovations. With the stock still stuck in a \u201changover\u201d after Informatica (NYSE:INFA) acquisition talks dissipated two weeks ago, I think investors are getting a pretty solid entry point at just shy of $280 per share, down around 12% from its March peak. Perhaps the huge negative reaction in CRM stock caused a swift end to deal hopes. In any case, Salesforce has a pretty good seat in the AI show and one industry rivals could envy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the future, customer relationship management will largely depend on advanced AI copilots. With distinct advantages in AI for its niche, Salesforce is likely to come out on top as it widens its moat and gains further share on rivals. Additionally, the more AI Salesforce attaches to its current offerings, the more value it\u2019s likely to produce for customers and the more willing they will be to pay up.\n\nAt 28.5 times forward P/E, Salesforce stands out as an undervalued AI stock that can more than keep up with the AI prowess of multi-trillion-dollar tech stars.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock had its moment in the AI sunshine, helping it hit more than decade-long highs. Nowadays, it\u2019s on the retreat as investors cool on the firm following a tough revenue miss and news of its $6.4 billion HashiCorp acquisition, even in light of its AI prospects.\n\nNow down just over 11% from its recent March peak, shares seem more like a worthy bargain.\n\nAs impressive as Watsonx generative AI has been, the technology may still be a few years away from taking growth into overdrive. There\u2019s no doubt that IBM has been taking steps to return to growth after many years of lackluster moves in the stock. AI will play a huge part in its comeback.\n\nThough less timely than some of its AI-savvy peers, IBM still stands out as a potential long-term winner from the rise of the technology. At 16.5 times forward P/E, IBM stock stands out as an option for value investors seeking exposure to the booming field of AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Salesforce The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks.

        "content": "ARMONK, N.Y., May 9, 2024 /CNW/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the availability of IBM Copilot Runway, a new offering from IBM Consulting designed to help enterprises create, customize, deploy and manage copilots including Copilot for Microsoft 365.

Despite natural gas prices languishing at bargain-basement levels for an extended period, this company has\u00a0managed to remain\u00a0profitable. ATO delivers steady and consistent returns for shareholders. While Atmos Energy\u2019s top-line figures have been flat, the upside potential\u00a0going forward\u00a0hinges more on natural gas price dynamics.\n\nImportantly, ATO represents a solid bet for both the short and long term.\u00a0Natural gas prices\u00a0are likely to\u00a0readjust higher in the long run, and we\u2019ve already seen a slight rebound in May. With Russia still supplying billions of cubic meters of gas to Europe, pressure will mount on the U.S. and Qatar, especially if we witness a cold winter.\u00a0Nevertheless,\u00a0natural gas prices don\u2019t impact this company as much as one might think.\u00a0Atmos Energy makes its money through the volume of natural gas distributed.\u00a0This\u00a0is why, despite lower revenue, net income grew 14.5% in the recent quarter.\n\nAlso, the company invested $770 million in capital expenditures, earning a robust 9.8% return. And, it benefited from $129 million in regulatory gains, with 82% of investments focused on safety and reliability. Atmos Energy appears well-positioned for continued regulatory approvals and earnings growth. Investors like the dividend yield that stands at an attractive 2.57%, with 40 consecutive years of dividend hikes.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s oldest and largest tech companies, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has witnessed record performance\u00a0in recent months. It was benefiting from the broader rally in software and tech companies.\n\nThis uptrend didn\u2019t last too long, however,\u00a0as the stock has corrected again.\u00a0Trading at\u00a0around $169, IBM is down roughly 15% from its March peak.\n\nMy\u00a0biggest\u00a0bull case for IBM stems from management\u2019s focus on many high-growth sectors to reignite the stock, thus far a successful approach. As I mentioned in a February 2022 article, \u201cIBM will likely grow much faster in the future as it is making a turnaround by shifting its focus to cloud computing, AI, and blockchain, which will position it as a dynamic tech company.\u201d That is precisely what has transpired, with the stock up 36% over the past year.\n\nHence, this\u00a0performance\u00a0is likely to\u00a0continue. IBM has solid recurring revenue and a cash cow segment as a foundation from which it can build into some of the hottest sectors right now.\u00a0Further, quantum computing will drive as much hype as artificial intelligence (AI)is doing in the coming decades. And IBM is ahead of its peers by miles in this field.\n\nAlso, its $6.4 billion acquisition of HashiCorp will give it a strong foothold in the cloud sector. Finally, the forward dividend yield\u00a0stands at\u00a0a solid 3.97%, with 29 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n\nStanley Black & Decker (SWK) Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security products\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) has been one of the worst-performing names over the past three years, with the stock trading sideways after the 2021/22 selloffs.\u00a0Many remain bearish here, but\u00a0I see\u00a0this\u00a0as\u00a0a prime once-in-a-decade buying opportunity.\u00a0The company\u2019s decline is\u00a0mostly due\u00a0to rate hikes. Those had Stanley Black & Decker paying around $145 million per quarter in interest expenses. More importantly,\u00a0a lot\u00a0of the bad news has\u00a0been priced\u00a0in, and I see\u00a0very little\u00a0downside risk left.\n\nIn addition, the infrastructure and construction boom is providing tailwinds to this company, and management has been executing well. The bloated inventory has come down from $6.6 billion in Q2 of 2022 to $4.7 billion in Q4 of 2024. And, over $1 billion in pre-tax run-rate cost savings since 2022 is expected to reach $2 billion next year. Accordingly, analysts estimate EPS to rise from $4 in 2024 to $6.8 in 2026.\n\nThus, we could see much higher earnings if rate cuts happen faster than expected. The forward dividend yield is 3.71%, with consecutive dividend hikes for the past 57 years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg Law) -- Ex-Trump adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s legal group has sued IBM Corp. subsidiary Red Hat Inc. claiming the company\u2019s diversity goals led to the discriminatory treatment and termination of a former White male employee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmericans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump\u2019s Demeanor Trump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial US Pauses Arms Shipment to Israel on Rafah Invasion Concerns\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the District of Idaho, America First Legal said that Allan Kingsley Wood, a former senior director at Red Hat, faced race and gender discrimination because of the IBM subsidary\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion program, which involved setting hiring goals for women and minorities.\n\nAFL has filed several lawsuits over corporate DEI-related issues. But the conservative group has more frequently brought its complaints directly to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, submitting over 30 requests for the civil rights agency to investigate high profile corporations\u2019 DEI programs for bias, including one targeting IBM\u2019s diversity work.\n\nThe EEOC has yet to respond publicly to the group\u2019s letters, which generally claim companies\u2019 DEI efforts discriminate against White and male employees in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nConservative groups have increasingly launched legal attacks on corporate DEI following the US Supreme Court\u2019s June 2023 decision curtailing affirmative action in college admissions. Suits have claimed that hiring and recruitment decisions made around both full-time jobs and fellowships at large companies are biased against White workers, but have gained only limited traction in federal courts.\n\nRed Hat in 2021 began implementing new diversity requirements, hiring a chief executive officer of DEI to lead these efforts, Wednesday\u2019s suit said. AFL claims the company said its DEI initiatives would impact hiring decisions.\n\nWood vocalized his opposition to the company\u2019s DEI policies because of his religious, personal and political views \u201cand continuously advocated for hiring based on merit and skill rather than other immutable characteristics,\u201d AFL said in its complaint.\n\nThe conservative legal group said Red Hat announced DEI goals that involved \u201cquotas\u201d, aiming \u201cto remake its workforce demographic, seeking to reach 30% women globally and 30% associates of color in the United States by 2028.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, Wood was told his role was being eliminated along with 21 other employees, the vast majority of whom were also both White and male, the lawsuit said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe complaint also said that Wood was retaliated against for expressing his beliefs, by cutting short his approved leave under the Family Medical Leave Act to terminate his employment.\n\nIn its letter to the EEOC in December 2023 and a letter to IBM\u2019s board of directors, Miller\u2019s group cited video footage of IBM\u2019s CEO Arvind Krishna and Red Hat CEO Paul Cormier discussing diversity. Krishna says in the video that corporate executives\u2019 bonuses can be affected if they don\u2019t meet DEI goals.\n\nWood is seeking compensation as well as an injunction against Red Hat\u2019s DEI program.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Riddhi Setty in Washington at rsetty@bloombergindustry.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rebekah Mintzer at rmintzer@bloombergindustry.com\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags A New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger The Company Preaching America\u2019s Nuclear Revival Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 2 Tech Stocks Just Declared Dividend Raises",
        "content": "In the old days, it was exceptional for a tech stock to pay a dividend. That's because many companies in the sector weren't profitable in their early stages, and needed to save coin to maintain their businesses. The ones that became successful often stuck to that policy, choosing to prioritize activities like research and development. The hope was that investors would be satisfied simply with a rising stock price.\n\nThat's no longer the norm as the top tech companies on the scene are well-established, habitually profit-making, and frequently able to generate big piles of cash. Two incumbents that have declared dividend increases based on this solid foundation are International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Let's take a brief look at both.\n\n1. IBM\n\nIBM was a tech company before tech companies existed to any meaningful degree. Its origins stretch back to 1911 as a business selling recordkeeping and tabulation equipment for corporate clients. Very soon after that, it began paying a regular quarterly dividend, and it hasn't let up since.\n\nThese days it declares consistent, if incremental, dividend raises once annually. The 2024 version was a bump of $0.01 per share, as in previous years. IBM's new quarterly distribution is $1.67 per share.\n\nAny business that has navigated all sorts of economies and emerged from more than one world war has done so by being flexible. Over the years, IBM's business has morphed -- it's been a leading manufacturer of personal computers, later it became a major player in the IT consultancy space, and these days it's concentrating on its hybrid cloud computing offerings and making a concentrated push into artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIt's sensible to operate in these high-demand segments, and IBM as a company and a stock has generally been doing well. Yes, investors traded out of the shares following the company's latest quarterly earnings report, but that felt like a case of inflated expectations. The stock had zoomed nearly 50% higher over the past year, after all. IBM's revenue rose, if not spectacularly, while management did a fine job of lifting the bottom line.\n\nI can see more future improvements in the fundamentals, especially in AI, where the company's consulting contracts are already worth over $1 billion. IBM is positioning itself to be a major force in this technology, and history shows it's usually successful when it marshals its considerable resources to attack a market.\n\nIBM's dividend raise will take effect with the first $1.67-per-share payout, which is set to be distributed on June 10 to investors of record as of May 10. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield a relatively generous 4%.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm doesn't have the long history of IBM, but it's been a reliably regular quarterly dividend payer for more than 20 years. It matches IBM in its habit of declaring dividend raises every year, the latest being a 6% increase to $0.85 per share.\n\nQualcomm's main stock in trade is chipsets for smartphones. Given the company's very strong presence in this space, it's likely you've got its components packed into your beloved iPhone or Galaxy as we speak. Qualcomm is also active in the next-generation automotive market and the Internet of Things (IoT) sphere. Finally, it earns money from licensing its numerous patents.\n\nOf these, it's the smartphone market that's the largest and sturdiest, and automotive that's growing the fastest. The company's just-released fiscal second-quarter results show 1% year-over-year growth in the phone segment to almost $6.2 billion. IoT, alas, isn't doing so hot; its top line slumped by 11% to $1.2 billion. Thankfully, licensing landed in positive territory with a 2% rise to $1.3 billion.\n\nThe automotive segment, on the other hand, really was quite the race car as far as revenue was concerned. Thanks to the success of its Snapdragon Ride assisted driving platform, the segment's take grew a powerful 35% to $603 million. Yes, that's a small portion of total company revenue now, but automobiles are rapidly becoming more sophisticated, and reliable tech is sorely needed for smartening them up.\n\nSo in short, Qualcomm is still managing to squeeze out growth from its two traditional business lines. And despite that flagging IoT business, automotive is hot and sure to get hotter. This is a well-established company with good technology that should become an important player in that dynamic sector. The future continues to look bright for Qualcomm.\n\nThe company's new dividend is to be handed out on June 20 to stockholders of record as of May 30. The payout would yield 1.9% on the current share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The economy is a feeling a touch blue \u2014 as seen through the lens of one of the world's largest tech players, IBM (IBM).\n\n\"Interest rates are higher for longer than most people supposed in the middle of last year. So as you take that into account, if interest rates are 2%, 3% higher for the five and 10-year (bond), then people thought that means all of the debt is going to carry an extra price,\" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday.\n\n\"So I think CFOs are belt-tightening against that. Now, that's not systemic. That's not really secular, but it is a problem that's going to be there for a year or two,\" he added. However, he remains \"quite optimistic\" about the US and global economy.\n\nIBM's first quarter shed light on the mixed economic backdrop in the US as higher interest rates take hold.\n\nBig Blue's first quarter sales rose 1% from the prior year to $14.5 billion, falling just shy of Wall Street estimates. The company's lucrative consulting business saw sales unchanged amid more tepid corporate spending plans. Infrastructure sales declined 1% year on year.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $1.68 beat consensus forecasts by $0.08.\n\nThe company reiterated a forecast of constant currency revenue growth, \"consistent with its mid-single digit model.\"\n\nIBM did see momentum in its AI business, however.\n\nThe company revealed it had more than $1 billion in AI-related backlog. Krishna says companies are coming to IBM to unlock new productivity, with the economy being on the uncertain side.\n\nIBM's overall backlog increased 7% from a year ago.\n\n\"We view IBM\u2019s Software and Consulting businesses well positioned for Hybrid Cloud and Digital Transformation growth ahead. However, we think the setup for the stock is challenging as investors weigh the potential for a global macroeconomic trough ahead and the company manages its way through the tail end of its most recent mainframe cycle,\" JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex said in a client note.\n\nIBM shares are up 4% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's 9% advance.\n\nThe enthusiasm amongst investors for all things AI rages on.

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase International Business Machines' shares before the 9th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 10th of June.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.67 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.64 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, International Business Machines stock has a trailing yield of around 4.0% on the current share price of US$165.71. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether International Business Machines has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nView our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. International Business Machines paid out more than half (74%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 48% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.\n\nIt's positive to see that International Business Machines's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That explains why we're not overly excited about International Business Machines's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. International Business Machines has delivered an average of 5.7% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs International Business Machines worth buying for its dividend? The payout ratios appear reasonably conservative, which implies the dividend may be somewhat sustainable. Still, with earnings basically flat, International Business Machines doesn't stand out from a dividend perspective. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.\n\nIf you want to look further into International Business Machines, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for International Business Machines that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

        "content": "Quantum computing is a space that leverages advanced computing techniques and quantum mechanics to solve problems that trouble conventional computers. This includes a variety of optimization applications, such financial modeling, weather and climate forecasting and traffic optimization. However, quantum computing still remains highly theoretically, and it will surely be some time before their use-cases expand beyond research and laboratories.\n\nThere are a number of quantum computing start-ups, such as IonQ (NYSE:IONQ), that have developed game changing technologies in the field. Unfortunately, given the amount of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment \u2014 elevated interest rates globally and persistent inflation pressures \u2014 investing in these pure-play quantum computing businesses is looking less and less like a viable option.\n\nBelow are three undervalued quantum computing stocks with a strong presence in the quantum computing space.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been researching quantum computing and employing the technology in cryptology since the early parts of the 21st century. In 2023, IBM continued to deliver fascinating finding. The company\u2019s quantum computer was able to solve a complex physics question better than a conventional computer could. IBM\u2019s Condor quantum processor reached new boundaries with 1,121 superconducting qubits, an industry achievement.\n\nIBM\u2019s share price is now trading at 16.8x forward earnings, which is less than a number of tech giants in the space. In the past years, top-line growth has remained in the modest single digits. Investments in the quantum computing revolution could allow IBM to reap financial rewards in the future. This would, in turn, help boost revenue growth.\n\nFor investors desiring to bet on quantum computing, IBM still makes a solid choice among undervalued quantum computing stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another American tech giant with sizable exposure to the quantum computing space. The tech firm has been able to cross new boundaries with its Sycamore quantum computer. These days, Alphabet is more concerned with finding viable applications for quantum computing. In early March, Alphabet announced a $5 million reward to scientists who could research and develop practical applications for quantum computing.\n\nThe key reason Alphabet could be a great long-term quantum computing investment is the company\u2019s Google Cloud product. Google Cloud is Alphabet\u2019s main growth engine. Moreover, the tech giant has begun deploying quantum computing pow1er through its Google Cloud service. Offering quantum computing power through cloud services will not only make quantum computing more accessible but also foment the creation of practical applications for the novel technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\u2019s shares are trading at 21.6x forward earnings, which is also below tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) is an industrial conglomerate with an advanced technological bent. The company has pursued the development of quantum computing technologies for some years now. In fact, Honeywell\u2019s entry into the quantum computing space can be traced back to the formation of Quantinuum , which was the result of a business combination between Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum in 2021. Furthermore, Honeywell has invested $300 million into Quantinuum and owns a majority stake in the company. Quantinuum has been valued at $5 billion as of early 2024.\n\nBefore this business combination, Honeywell\u2019s Quantum Solutions division had been breaking numerous barriers in the space. Successive breakthroughs are indeed possible. Honeywell\u2019s stock trades at 19.4x forward earnings. For a quantum computing investment, Honeywell and its growth prospects in the space, makes it an enticing opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 states with the highest and lowest resignation rates. We have also discussed the state of jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.\n\nThe state of US jobs in recent times has been nothing less than a paradox as the headline job numbers seem to be strong but Americans are struggling to secure jobs. Despite the addition of 275,000 jobs in February 2024 alone, the labor market has become increasingly competitive, with companies exercising caution in hiring given the economic uncertainty.\n\nThe hiring slowdown can be attributed to various factors, including companies being wary of high interest rates and wages, leading to a more selective hiring process. As a result, the job market has become more challenging for both recent graduates and seasoned professionals alike. Speaking of hiring, see industries hiring rightnow in 2024.\n\nIt is also true that the current job market is plagued by a mismatch between job openings and the skills and qualifications of job seekers. Despite there being 8.9 million job openings in January, down from a peak of 12 million in March 2022, many positions remain unfilled, while workers struggle to secure employment that matches their qualifications.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in Monster's \u201cNew Year, New Career\u201d 2024 report, 95% of surveyed US workers expressed intent to seek new job opportunities. Despite the widespread desire for change, Monster's findings reveal a cautious sentiment among workers as 68% individuals believe that it will be challenging to secure new employment due to economic conditions.\n\nMoreover, employers are faced with mounting pressure to address employee concerns, as indicated by Deloitte's Q4 2023 CFO Survey, which highlights the growing importance of competitive compensation and transparent communication to retain talent. With 45% of workers citing the need for higher income and 64% anticipating salary adjustments to counter inflation, businesses are urged to adapt their strategies to navigate evolving workforce dynamics effectively.\n\nIt must be noted that in 2024, leisure and hospitality is the industry with the highest resignation rate in the US. On the other hand, information is one of the industries with the lowest turnover rates.\n\nApart from the resignation rates, there are also concerns about layoffs. For example, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s recent decision to reduce its workforce in marketing and communications has sparked concern, with reports indicating a major impact on staffing levels. In a brief meeting led by International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Adashek, employees were informed of the impending job cuts, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThroughout the tech industry, job cuts have become increasingly common, with over 200 companies announcing layoffs, affecting nearly 50,000 positions so far this year. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s restructuring efforts align with its strategy to adapt to evolving market demands, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence. Despite recent growth, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) continues to face challenges in monetizing its AI offerings, facing stiff competition from industry giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nOn the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has adopted a strategy of prudent hiring. In 2023, the company reduced its headcount by 22%, down to 67,317, as part of cost-cutting measures amid challenges in the digital ad market. Despite this reduction, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s performance has been impressive, with fourth-quarter sales growing by 25% to $40.1 billion, and net income increased by 201% to $14 billion. The company's operating margin more than doubled to 41%, showcasing its ability to grow while cutting costs.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to maintain this lean approach to hiring, focusing on high-paying technical roles rather than hyper growth. The company intends to prioritize investments in infrastructure, particularly in artificial intelligence, with total expenses expected to range between $94 billion to $99 billion. Zuckerberg aims to keep Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) culturally aligned with this lean strategy even beyond 2024, reflecting a long-term commitment to efficiency and stability. 25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates\n\nPhotographee.eu/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the states with the highest and lowest resignation rates, we relied on Selectsoftware\u2019s data on quit rates by state collected from July 2023 to October 2023. The list is presented in descending order of resignation rates.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n25. Alaska\n\nResignation Rate: 3.55%\n\nAlaska ranks 2th on our list. With 3.55% resignation rate, Alaska is the state with the highest turnover rate in the US.\n\n24. Montana\n\nResignation Rate: 3.30%\n\nMontana faces challenges in employment owing to its sparse population, limited diversity of industries, and geographical isolation. The state's economy heavily relies on agriculture, tourism, and natural resource extraction, which may not offer as many job opportunities as more diversified economies.\n\n23. Louisiana\n\nResignation Rate: 3.28%\n\nLouisiana is facing on of the highest resignation rates primarily due to the staggering economic impact of insufficient childcare. The annual loss of $1.1 billion in productivity, coupled with a $84 million shortfall in tax revenue, sheds light on the severity of the issue. Women and single parents are disproportionately affected and represent 14.6% and 11.1% respectively of those forced to quit jobs due to childcare problems. Additionally, with 50% of households relying on family members for childcare, the burden falls heavily on informal support networks.\n\n22. West Virginia\n\nResignation Rate: 3.28%\n\nWest Virginia faces challenges in its labor market due to factors like limited job opportunities, low wages, and inadequate workers' rights protections. The state's heavy reliance on industries like coal mining has led to economic instability, while high rates of poverty and limited access to education exacerbate the problem.\n\n21. Wyoming\n\nResignation Rate: 3.25%\n\nWyoming has consistently held the ignominious title of being the deadliest state for workers, with workplace fatalities per 100,000 workers reaching 13 in 2020, surpassing the second-worst state by a significant margin. Despite a 23% improvement in the per-capita fatality rate in 2021, Wyoming still ranked worst in the nation. The state's workplace safety track record remains dismal, with incidents ranging from falls and machinery accidents to fatal road incidents and even ice-related tragedies. Worker advocates highlight the urgent need for action, pointing to policies lacking in protection for employees and an attitude that dismisses safety concerns.\n\n20. Delaware\n\nResignation Rate: 3.20%\n\nThe proximity of Delaware to major metropolitan areas like Philadelphia and New York City provides residents with abundant job opportunities, making it easier for them to find new employment, if dissatisfied. Additionally, Delaware's economy is heavily influenced by industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, which often experience higher turnover rates due to competitive job markets and evolving job roles.\n\n19. Mississippi\n\nResignation Rate: 3.15%\n\nMississippi's high resignation rate stems from multifaceted challenges. Despite offering the nation's lowest cost of living, worker migration remains low due to a workforce lacking in education and productivity. With only 3% employed in STEM fields and 23% holding bachelor's degrees, the state struggles to meet the demands of modern industries. Additionally, its unfriendly business environment, coupled with discriminatory laws, further deter skilled professionals.\n\n18. South Carolina\n\nResignation Rate: 3.10%\n\nThe state has chosen not to adopt more generous labor policies compared to the national standards, such as keeping the minimum wage at the federal level and prohibiting local governments from setting higher minimum wages. Additionally, the absence of mandated paid sick and parental leave further exacerbates workers' challenges. The presence of right-to-work laws weakens unions, impacting workers' collective bargaining power. Historical racial dynamics also play a role, with states like North Carolina implementing less generous labor policies.\n\nIt is also one of the States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\n17. Idaho\n\nResignation Rate: 3.00%\n\nIdaho ranks poorly for work due to several factors. Firstly, it scores 41st in the country for wage policies, mainly because of its low minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which hasn't changed since 2009. Additionally, Idaho's tipped wage is also low at $3.35 per hour. Secondly, its worker protections rank 27th, lacking mandates for equal pay, paid sick leave, and protections against pay secrecy and shift scheduling changes.\n\n16. Tennessee\n\nResignation Rate: 3.00%\n\nThe state of Tennessee is experiencing a shift in its employment landscape as the turnover increase abates. Job openings have declined, particularly in industries like technology and banking, prompting a stabilization in hiring practices. While layoffs are occurring among major corporations, small businesses continue to modestly expand their workforce.\n\n15. Kentucky\n\nResignation Rate: 2.88%\n\nIn Kentucky, there's a pressing need for police officers, with hundreds of positions remaining unfilled across the state. Covington Capt. Jonathan Colwell highlights the challenges, citing diminishing incentives such as less appealing retirement packages. Ft. Wright Mayor Dave Hatter echoes this sentiment, attributing recruitment difficulties to changes in the pension system over the years.\n\n14. Arizona\n\nResignation Rate: 2.85%\n\nFollowing an increase tied to the pandemic, Arizona's resignations are returning to normal. The state's trajectory aligns with the national trend during \"The Great Resignation,\" where job seekers benefited from increased hiring incentives. November saw Arizona's resignation rate drop to 2.7 from 3.0 a year prior.\n\n13. New Mexico\n\nResignation Rate: 2.53%\n\nNew Mexico's resignations show a moderate rate owing to its economic stability, job opportunities, and workplace satisfaction. Unlike states with high turnover, New Mexico offers a relatively favorable environment for retention, supported by effective policies, a balanced economy, and a manageable cost of living.\n\n12. Michigan\n\nResignation Rate: 2.08%\n\nMichigan has one of the lowest resignation rates in the US, with a diverse economic landscape contributing to its stability. According to BLS, in 2017, the state housed 3,859,949 employees across 222,553 establishments. Its Q1 2023 gross state product reached $645.293 billion, ranking 14th nationally.\n\n11. Illinois\n\nResignation Rate: 1.98%\n\nWith a strategic focus on business development and economic growth, Illinois has tripled incentivized private investments to nearly $3 billion since 2022, creating thousands of new jobs. Its advantageous location, modern infrastructure, and strong transportation networks make it a prime destination for companies seeking to expand.\n\nClick here to see the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024 25 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The recent market correction paves the way for exploring compelling opportunities for investors looking for AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe stock market has slipped into correction territory, with key indexes shedding significant value. This slump follows record highs for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks last year,\u00a0which were\u00a0driven by a small group of powerful businesses from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs we chart new waters, the Federal Reserve has indicated that\u00a0interest rates would remain high for longer due to ongoing inflation in the world\u2019s largest economy. This approach has no immediate plans for a decrease, which adds to investors\u2019 uncertainty.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, investors now want more than just inflated growth metrics. They demand tangible results that benefit both the top and bottom lines. However, we are still in the early stages, so now is an excellent opportunity to stock up on these three AI stocks.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a digital behemoth that revolutionized social media and owns platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. Additionally, it is a pioneer in the AI revolution, constantly developing to incorporate cutting-edge AI technologies that boost user engagement.\n\nMoreover, Meta is taking things to the next level by building on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT initiative. New products like Llama 3 and the addition of real-time image generators to WhatsApp demonstrate this commitment to generative AI. With these developments, Meta is all set to take on its competitors head-to-head and become a significant force in the AI realm.\n\nFurthermore, Meta started\u00a0off\u00a0the year with a banger in the first quarter. Its\u00a0revenue bumped around 27% year-over-year (YOY) to a mind-boggling $36.46 billion, beating estimates by $240 million. Likewise, its earnings-per-share (EPS) clocked in at $4.71, slashing analyst expectations by 39 cents. Despite these fantastic results, we witnessed a dip in the company\u2019s shares after it provided a cautious outlook. Nevertheless, this presents a lucrative chance to buy the stock and maximize long-term profits.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) is at the forefront of interactive AI, a sector expected to grow rapidly. The company uses AI to provide contemporary text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities, enabling real-time translation and applications. This expertise broadens its customer base to restaurants, automobiles, and support centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ: NVDA) announcement on the ownership position in SOUN catapulted the stock to the top charts. However, NVDA\u2019s plan to sell up to 150 million shares was not well received and resulted in over 10% drop in SOUN\u2019s stock price last month. Yet, TipRanks analysts are optimistic and see a stellar 59% upside potential.\n\nThis upside potential is stoked by the SOUN\u2019s bright future growth prospects. The company has projected revenue for the fiscal year 2024\u00a0between $63 million and $77 million, which is greater than the $69.73 million average analyst estimate.\n\nLastly, with a\u00a0112% price upswing this year and trading approximately 50% below its peak of $10.25, a considerable horizon lies ahead for this small stock.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: UiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) specializes in robotics process automation (RPA), a niche that harnesses software robots and AI to streamline routine tasks. As businesses increasingly emphasize cutting costs and increasing productivity, robust automation solutions will become essential. Since PATH is regarded as the best RPA tool available, these developments will benefit it greatly.\n\nBuilding on this trend, UiPath has\u00a0included Watsonx.ai capabilities into its platform in partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM), giving users access to core AI\u00a0models. The claim is that more than 1,500 businesses use UiPath Autopilot, resulting in consistent weekly production and expression.\n\nThis technological leap has propelled UiPath\u2019s impressive financial growth. In Q4, the company notched a\u00a0revenue of $405.25 million, up 31.4% YOY and surpassing estimates by $21.56 million.\n\nLooking ahead, UiPath anticipates\u00a0generating $330 million to $335 million in revenue for Q1 of the 2025 fiscal year instead of the analysts\u2019 projected $338 million. If we add the 40% upside potential assigned by TipRanks\u00a0analysts, UiPath shines as a prime choice among AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNabeel Bukhari is a seasoned research analyst and keen investor.

        "title": "10 Best States for Technology Careers in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 10 best states for technology careers in the US. We have also discussed the latest demand related to tech skills and job roles. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best States for Technology Careers in the US.\n\nHow Rapidly Are Careers in Tech Growing?\n\nTo understand the strength of the tech employment landscape, it is worth highlighting that over the next decade, the tech workforce is set to expand twice as rapidly as the broader US job market. As per CompTIA\u2019s state of tech work force report of March 2024, projections suggest an average annual replacement rate of 6% for tech occupations from 2024 to 2034, equivalent to approximately 350,000 workers annually and totaling several million by 2034. This also explains why tech is one of the Top Industries That Are Hiring Right Now. Moreover, the median salary for tech roles is estimated to be about $104,556 which is more than double the median wage across all US occupations.\n\nAccording to Forbes, District of Columbia has 3,612 tech businesses per 100,000 establishments, making it one of the states with the most tech companies. Moreover, states like California and New York are known to be the best states for tech startups in the US.\n\nMost In-Demand Tech Skills in 2024\n\nWhile the future of tech jobs looks promising, according to recent research, AI-driven technologies are pushing for a shift in skill requirements, rather than replacing jobs outright in the tech sector particularly. For instance, in 2024, the demand for AI skills is on the rise across various sectors, particularly in coding, web development, and data science. Freelancers equipped with these skills are observing higher earnings and engaging in more complex projects. Moreover according to a report by Lightcast, the demand for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) skills has skyrocketed by 1,848% since 2022. This increase has confirmed a profound shift in employers' interests. From a mere 519 job postings in 2022, the number increased to over 10,000 since the launch of ChatGPT in December of that year. To read more about AI job postings, see the Top 20 US States for AI Jobs.\n\nIn parallel, the job market has seen an increase in postings for various AI-related roles, such as data scientists and software engineers, with notable exceptions like curriculum writers as educational institutions adapt to incorporate AI knowledge. The proliferation of these positions suggests a fundamental restructuring of industries to accommodate AI technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOwing to the demand of digital and technical skills, data scientists, cyber security experts and machine learning learning engineers are predicted to have Careers that Will Be in High Demand in the Next 10 Years. Despite the prestige and hype associated with tech jobs, there has also been increasing fear due to persistent tech lay offs. Let\u2019s look at what exactly went wrong and if a career in tech is an insecure option to consider.\n\nDo Tech Lay Offs Mean a Weak Economy?\n\nIn the past few months, the economy has seen excellent growth alongside noteworthy layoffs in the US and around the globe. Since recent job reductions have primarily occurred in select sectors like technology, finance, and media, it has raised eyebrows about the rising insecurity within tech jobs. It is also worth highlighting that the overall job creation has increased in the US, averaging 248,000 new positions monthly over the last six months. With the unemployment rate standing at just 3.7%, these layoffs are overshadowed by strong hiring as well.\n\nWhile layoffs can disrupt individuals' lives, they don't necessarily reflect economic weakness. Companies may trim their workforce for various reasons, such as adjusting to shifts in their business strategy or optimizing profit margins. For instance, many tech firms hired aggressively during the pandemic but misjudged future demand, prompting them to scale back. Despite these layoffs, overall economic indicators suggest a healthy job market, supported by consistent hiring across different industries.\n\nCompanies Hiring for Tech Roles in 2024\n\nVisa Inc (NYSE:V) has currently 345 jobs postings available on its website for technology careers. Speaking of the company, Visa Inc (NYSE:V), has recetly launched a $100 million initiative with a focus on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) ventures. Spearheaded by Visa Ventures, the company's investment arm with a track record dating back to 2007, this initiative speaks volumes about Visa Inc (NYSE:V) commitment to technological innovation in payments and fintech. Capitalizing on GenAI, a technology Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has been utilizing since 1993, the company aims to pioneer transformative changes in commerce.\n\nOn the other hand, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has been on a hiring spree, rebounding from a major layoff last year. Despite laying off approximately 10% of its employees in 2023, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s headcount has increased to 72,682 workers by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, up from nearly 80,000 previously. CEO Marc Benioff has set ambitious hiring goals and aims to onboard 3,000 new employees as the company ramps up its focus on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company plans to tap into regions with abundant talent pools and lower living costs. This approach also mirrors a trend observed in other tech giants like Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), which have started avoiding hiring in high-salary cities such as New York and San Francisco. Nevertheless, the emphasis on AI and data is driving Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s recruitment efforts, reflecting a broader industry shift towards advanced technologies. 10 Best States for Technology Careers in the US\n\nCopyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best 10 states for technology careers in the US in 2024, we identified the highest paying states for tech jobs using data from Bureau of Labor Statistics based on average salaries for Computer and Mathematics Occupations by state.

Moreover, with an average salary of $100,750 for tech careers, Georgia is one of the states that pay the most for IT jobs. The net employment in the tech sector in Georgia is 312,010.\n\n7. Illinois\n\nAverage Tech Salary: 17\n\nNet Tech Employment: 7\n\nAverage Rank: 12\n\nIllinois is about to set off for a quantum technology revolution and hence, is set to generate significant economic impact and job growth. With a projected $60 billion boost to the Chicago metro area over the next decade, the Bloch Quantum Tech Hub's initiative promises substantial growth. Governor JB Pritzker anticipates the creation of 30,000 quantum jobs, training for 50,000 workers, and support for 200 quantum companies by 2035.

        "title": "Empowering Teachers With Free AI Resources From IBM SkillsBuild",
        "content": "For Teacher Appreciation Week, supporting educators to enhance student learning\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 6, 2024 / Teachers play an essential role in helping the next generation of learners develop STEM skills that will prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow, especially in this new AI era. They inspire innovators and cultivate the creative thinking that will solve the world's biggest challenges.\n\nTeachers face a variety of challenges every day, from creating appealing content to keeping up with AI and STEM tools, they need resources and support that are cost-effective and easy to implement. IBM SkillsBuild is empowering teachers with free resources, developed with teachers' input year-round to enhance student learning. IBM SkillsBuild offers curriculum maps, lesson plans, student worksheets, and hands-on activities, which can be easily used to supplement existing curriculum with core technical and workplace skills, including AI.\n\nZach Switzer, a high school teacher at John Marshall School of IT (Cleveland, Ohio), emphasized the importance of teaching AI to students now. He said, \"Giving students a chance to learn with AI, while also teaching students about the intricacies of AI is necessary in my opinion. We will need individuals who understand and can manipulate AI, and who better than the generation that grew up utilizing the tool? Giving our young people access while addressing how and why AI should be used will ensure the future is in capable hands.\"\n\nIBM SkillsBuild's Teaching Artificial Intelligence Toolkit can help with this. With this toolkit teachers can simultaneously educate themselves and implement AI coursework within their classrooms, covering topics like why AI is important to students, the role of AI in education, generative AI, and AI career opportunities. IBM SkillsBuild toolkits are available on various topics like teaching cybersecurity, sustainability, data, professional skills, and more.\n\n\"As a science teacher with no prior education in AI or cybersecurity, I was desperate to gain some understanding. With IBM SkillsBuild, I was so happy to finally have access to a curriculum with digestible information on these topics. Not only can I digest what my students are doing and learning, but I can further their knowledge or understanding with the content I learned from IBM SkillsBuild teacher toolkits and coursework. IBM SkillsBuild has granted me access to information surrounding soft skills, employment opportunities, and career readiness that I can easily share with my students,\" Zach added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother teacher, Mark Vukovic at CTEC of Licking County (Newton, Ohio), discussed how IBM SkillsBuild has helped his students: \"I've accumulated several certifications myself while learning about how these certifications would benefit my students. The benefit of these learning modules is that they help students walk away from a classroom with not just expert instruction, but a valuable certification that they can use to apply for a job. Teachers can easily incorporate these learning modules into their existing lessons or assign students to work on them out of the classroom.\"\n\nWhether you're a teacher, a student, a parent, or a job seeker, IBM SkillsBuild provides over 1,000 free courses on technology and professional skills. Through IBM SkillsBuild, IBM continues to progress towards our commitment to skill 30 million people globally by 2030.\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While artificial intelligence represents one of the hottest ticket items out there, the reality is that many if not most AI stocks are overvalued. However, digital intelligence doesn\u2019t have to come at a premium price.\n\nJust like anything else, if you look around, you can find more attractive deals. Granted, by walking the path less traveled, you will incur higher risk. That\u2019s just due to the lack of predictability tied to moving away from groupthink.\n\nStill, if you want tremendous deals, you can\u2019t get them by buying into whatever the crowd is selling. No, you\u2019ve got to walk a lonelier path. If you\u2019re up to the challenge, these are the less-appreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nAs the vanguard of myriad digital innovations, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy. Sure, the legacy tech juggernaut doesn\u2019t have the pizzazz of most of its peers. However, we\u2019re talking about an enterprise that consistently gets the job done. It is profitable, featuring a net margin of 13.18%. Its return on equity (ROE) also stands at 36.3%, above 93.25% of the competition.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate earnings per share to land at $9.93. That\u2019s up from last year\u2019s result of $9.62. Also, the most optimistic target calls for earnings of $10.32, a significant improvement. On the top line, they\u2019re targeting $63 billion on average, with a high-side view of $63.44 billion. In 2023, IBM rang up $61.86 billion in sales.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, consensus revenue calls for $65.84 billion while the blue-sky target aims at $67.46 billion. Right now, shares tread at 2.45X trailing-year revenue, which is near the median value of 2.27X. For forward earnings, IBM trades at only 16.44X. Given the anticipated expansion in both the top and bottom lines, IBM ranks among the AI stocks to buy.\n\nDuos Technologies (DUOT) Industrial technology concept. Communication network. INDUSTRY 4.0. Factory automation.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocused on the software application field, Duos Technologies (NASDAQ:DUOT) designs, develops, deploys and operates intelligent technology solutions. Its main product is Centraco, an enterprise information management software platform that consolidates data and events from multiple sources into a unified and distributive user interface. Duos has the potential to bring tremendous efficiencies to enterprises, making it one of the more enticing AI stocks.\n\nFinancially, Duos isn\u2019t the most stable enterprise out there. So, much of the bullish case centers on its forward-looking narrative. That said, analysts believe that the company can post sales of $16.2 million by the end of this year. If so, that would represent a 116.8% increase from last year\u2019s haul of $7.47 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in fiscal 2025, revenue could reach $25 million. That would be up 54.3% from projected 2024 sales. Also, the most optimistic target calls for revenue of $30 million.\n\nTrading at 2.98X trailing-year revenue, DUOT isn\u2019t exactly undervalued. However, when priced against 2024 sales (and especially 2025 sales), the aforementioned multiple gets more attractive. Getting there is no guarantee. But if you believe the trajectory, DUOT is one of the AI stocks to consider.\n\nCerence (CRNC) AI stocks to Buy, Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks. ai chip stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nAlso falling under the software application field, Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) provides AI-powered virtual assistants for the mobility and transportation markets. Per its corporate profile, Cerence offers edge software components, cloud-connected components, virtual assistant coexistence and professional services. It also provides conversational AI-based solutions, such as speech recognition and natural language processing.\n\nAs with other speculative AI stocks, investors must ignore the work-in-progress type of financial profile. This is another idea where narrative plays a big role. Still, the storyline is an attractive one. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to hit $1.35. That\u2019s well above last year\u2019s result of 36 cents.\n\nOn the top line, experts see sales flying up to $359.96 million. If so, we\u2019re talking about a 22.2% growth rate from the prior year\u2019s tally of $294.5 million. Also, the high-side estimate calls for revenue of $379.3 million.\n\nCRNC is already undervalued, trading at 1.13X trailing-year sales. However, with such robust growth projected, Cerence is potentially an even better deal. It\u2019s one of the AI stocks to gamble on.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How Much Will IBM Pay Out in Dividends Over the Next Year?",
        "content": "How much will International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) pay out in dividends this year?\n\nIt seems like a simple question, but there are layers to it. You can look at Big Blue's dividend payouts from a few different angles -- and they're all helpful to prospective IBM investors.\n\nDividends per share\n\nIBM likes to increase its dividend payout per share every year. The streak of annual dividend boosts started in 1995 and continued with the 29th straight boost earlier last week. The quarterly payout now stands at $1.67 per share, adding up to $6.68 per share over the next year: IBM Dividend Chart\n\nTotal dividend payouts\n\nYou can find out how much cash IBM returned to shareholders in the form of dividend payments in two simple ways:\n\nLook up the \"dividends\" line of IBM's cash flow analysis, a standard part of its quarterly earnings reports. Multiply the dividends per share by the number of basic shares outstanding, a figure found in the same report's \"comparative financial analysis.\"\n\nWhichever way you calculate the dividend, IBM's cash payments landed at $1.52 billion in the first quarter and $6.06 billion over the last four reports.\n\nDividends as a percentage of free cash flow\n\nYou can also look at the portion of free cash flow IBM sends out to dividend recipients.\n\nIBM's cash profits stood at $1.9 billion in the first quarter, or $11.8 billion over the last four reports. For the dividend, that's an 80% share of the single-quarter free cash flow and a 51% cash payout ratio on a trailing-12-month basis.\n\nChanges in 2024?\n\nIBM's dividend increases are as reliable as clockwork but not always large. Likewise, the number of shares has stayed nearly flat in recent years. So the dividend payouts over the next 12 months will look like this:\n\n$6.68 per share, up from $6.64. $6.12 billion in total dividend payments. Approximately 51% of free cash flow, estimated to reach $12 billion this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $1.67 on 10th of June. This makes the dividend yield 4.0%, which is above the industry average.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nInternational Business Machines' Earnings Easily Cover The Distributions\n\nWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, International Business Machines' dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 49% of free cash flows. This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 10.3%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 71%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend. historic-dividend\n\nInternational Business Machines Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $3.80 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $6.68. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.8% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. International Business Machines hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.\n\nOur Thoughts On International Business Machines' Dividend\n\nOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

        "content": "Last month wasn't a great one for the overall stock market, but it was a downright awful one for a handful of blue chip stocks.\n\nMost investors understand oversized dips can be buying opportunities, but they should also recognize when jumping into a stumbling stock is a bad idea. The stocks' current weakness may merely be an omen of what's to come. How do you know the difference? You dig deeper and consider the bigger picture.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (DJINDICES: ^DJI) biggest April losers. They may be blue chips, but that doesn't necessarily make them great picks right now.\n\nThe Dow's worst of the worst\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5% last month. That setback doesn't hold a candle to the losses some of its constituents suffered, though. Shares of Boeing(NYSE: BA), International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), and Home Depot(NYSE: HD) each fell nearly 13% in April, while technology giant Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) watched its stock slide over 30%. INTC Chart\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nAircraft maker Boeing's shares lost altitude all month long. Its first-quarter results released in late April, however, ultimately validated that selling. Revenue fell 8% year over year as continued design and manufacturing problems with its newer 737 and 787 jets crimped demand. The company also booked a heavy loss of $355 million, reminding investors that these headaches aren't mere nuisances -- there's a clear financial cost to them. Then, there's the added disruption of an impending CEO switch. Current chief executive Dave Calhoun will be stepping down at the end of the year, but there's already drama regarding who should replace him.\n\nIBM's setback is also mostly earnings-related, although the announcement it will be acquiring cloud software company HashiCorp didn't help. First-quarter earnings of $1.68 per share topped estimates of $1.60, but revenue of $14.46 billion fell short of expectations of $14.55 billion. And while most analysts are generally bullish on the idea of folding HashiCorp into IBM's existing cloud software business, now may or may not be the ideal time to work out such deal. The $6.4 billion offer for HashiCorp is also rather pricey.\n\nAs for Home Depot stock, don't blame earnings for its poor April performance -- it won't release its fiscal Q1 numbers until mid-May. Blame the macro environment instead. Inflation proved problematic during the home improvement retailer's fiscal Q4 (ended Jan. 28), dragging sales 3% lower on a year-over-year basis. Nothing's significantly changed in the meantime, though. Indeed, if anything, the environment for homebuilding and home improvement has worsened in the shadow of lingering inflation and high interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Intel stock crashed in April in anticipation of the bad news it dished out with its Q1 results. Although revenue was up 9% year over year, the chipmaker's still facing considerable challenges. Its first-quarter top line of $12.7 billion fell just a bit short of analysts' estimates, while revenue guidance of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion for the quarter now under way was below the $13.6 billion consensus. It's the second consecutive quarter Intel's outlook hasn't been up to snuff, although these back-to-back disappointments may only remind shareholders of deeper-rooted problems for the company.\n\nThe question remains, though ... should you buy any (or all) of April's worst-performing Dow Jones stocks?\n\nTo buy, or not to buy, these dips?\n\nIf you're looking for a sweeping, universally applicable answer, then the answer has to be no -- it's not time to buy April's worst-performing Dow stocks.\n\nSuch an answer, however, oversimplifies the matter.\n\nWhile all pullbacks are potential buying opportunities, not all pullbacks are worth acting on. As I previously noted, sometimes steep sell-offs are a glimpse of what's to come. Other times, sell-offs are happening because something unexpected and insurmountable has taken shape. It's also worth noting that a calendar month isn't a sound basis for determining whether or not a sell-off has run its course. Rebounds can start in the middle of the month, and a stock might slide for two or three (or more) months before finding a bottom.\n\nIn other words, April's poor performance is only a tiny piece of the much bigger picture you should consider before diving in. With that in mind, Home Depot and Intel aren't worth stepping into following last month's stumbles.\n\nInflation and high interest rates are still clearly with us, and they will likely remain with us for a while. The Federal Reserve doesn't intend to cut interest rates until much later this year, and even then, those cuts will likely be modest. This will not only limit demand for new homes, but it will even limit demand for home upgrades. Both are a headwind for Home Depot.\n\nAnd Intel? It's been struggling off and on for years. Its biggest competitive advantage right now is simply its massive capacity to meet the growing need for computer processors and related technology. Even so, rivals are capitalizing on its struggles. In the meantime, the company may be bogged down by the construction of the factories needed to develop its own foundry business. It's a distraction that could last for years.\n\nBut what about IBM and Boeing? There's a bullish case to be made for both.\n\nIBM arguably is overpaying for HashiCorp. However, that premium can be worth it to get an attractive deal done. Given IBM's smashing success with 2019's acquisition of Red Hat, investors should be cautiously optimistic this purchase will pay off too. In the meantime, the technology outfit remains a cash cow, even if it's a slow-moving one. Leveraging its high-margin software business, IBM saw last quarter's operating cash flow rise 10% year over year to $4.2 billion, extending a multiquarter growth trend.\n\nNewcomers would also be stepping into IBM stock while the dividend yield stands at a healthy 4%.\n\nAs for Boeing, yes, the company's a mess. Much of this mess is already reflected in the stock's price, though. Shares are back to where they were shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in 2020, and down 33% from their 52-week high. The company has plenty to figure out, but it's finally being forced to do so; a new CEO should help.\n\nMore than anything, however, the airline industry can't get around the fact it's going to need to purchase on the order of 42,000 new planes over the course of the coming 20 years. One way or another, Boeing's going to have to be a big supplier of those passenger jets. Just keep in mind any investment should be a (very) long-term position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Boeing wasn\u2019t one of them.

There have even been calls for \u201csmart cities\u201d based on IoT. All of which is a catalyst for some of the top IoT stocks.\n\nPlus,\u00a0according to IBM (NYSE:IBM), \u201cThe number of IoT devices is expected to continue to grow rapidly, with estimates suggesting that there will be tens of billion IoT devices in use over the next few years. This growth will be driven by increased adoption across industries, as well as the development of new use cases and applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence\u00a0and machine learning are becoming increasingly important for IoT, as they can be used to analyze vast amounts of data that is generated by IoT devices and extract meaningful insights. This can help businesses make more informed decisions and optimize their operations,\u201d they added.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo wonder the market could be worth about $3.37 trillion by 2031, according to analysts at SNS Insider. Even better, here are some of the top IoT stocks that should thrive on the growth.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter finding strong double-bottom support $30,\u00a0Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is back to $36.82. From here, I\u2019d like to see it retest its high of about $40 initially, as it continues with its strong uptrend.\n\nHelping, analysts at\u00a0Loop Capital just initiated a buy rating on the stock with a $42 price target. All thanks to its exposure to artificial intelligence, machine learning and IoT. Additionally, its technology allows it to be supportive of \u201cnearly endless\u201d use cases, implying that Samsara\u2019s total addressable market has few constraints, added the firm, as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nMost recently, IOT announced a collaboration with logistics and transportation company TMS to help improve the safety of drivers and operators, while reducing accidents.\n\n\u201cAs part of this partnership, TMS will integrate Samsara\u2019s AI Dash Cams into its comprehensive security program. These cameras will provide real-time in-cab alerts as well as the ability to retrieve video on demand, allowing TMS to reduce mobile device use while driving and easily exonerate non-at-fault drivers in the event of incidents,\u201d\u00a0as noted in the press release.\n\nGlobal X Internet of Things ETF (SNSR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nWe can also look at IoT-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) such as the\u00a0Global X Internet of Things ETF(NASDAQ:SNSR). Since bottoming out at around $28 in late 2023, the ETF ran to about $37. Now at $34.77, it\u2019s still a strong opportunity.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, the SNSR ETF holds 53 stocks that could benefit from \u201cbroader adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), as enabled by technologies such as WiFi, 5G telecommunications infrastructure, and fiber optics,\u201d as noted by Global X ETFs.\n\n\u201cThis includes the development and manufacturing of semiconductors and sensors, integrated products and solutions, and applications serving smart grids, smart homes, connected cars, and the industrial internet,\u201d they added.\n\nSome of its top holdings include\u00a0Garmin (NYSE:GRMN), DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM), STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to name a few.

It just saw its stock pop about $8 on earnings. While its adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 beat estimates for $1.01, revenues of $4.901 billion missed expectations of $5.008 billion.\n\n\u201cAptiv delivered solid results in the first quarter with 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and a return to growth above market, despite a slowdown in electrification in North America and Europe and persistent labor and material cost headwinds,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Kevin Clark, chairman and chief executive officer in a company press release.\n\nThe company also raised its fiscal year 2024 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $5.80 to $6.30, as compared the estimates calling for $5.75. However, it did lower its revenue outlook to a new range of $20.85 billion to $20.45 billion, which is below estimates for $21.57 billion.\n\nFortunately, as we begin to see some improvement in global electric vehicle sales, Aptiv\u2019s numbers should start to come back strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "While some quantum computing stocks present promising opportunities, there are also certain stocks that investors should approach with caution. Not all companies are in a position to capitalize on the technology\u2019s potential. Overhyped stocks lack the necessary fundamentals or face significant challenges in their business models, resulting in these quantum computing stocks to avoid.\n\nWe\u2019ll unravel the promising potential of undervalued quantum computing stocks and shed light on the stocks that may not live up to the hype. It should be stressed that the quantum computing industry is in the early and speculative stages. Many quantum systems remain theoretical, and there\u2019s insufficient evidence to suggest their solutions will lead to a commercial product.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) RGTI penny stocks\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) specializes in superconducting qubits and has secured strategic collaborations to advance its technologies. However, the company\u2019s ongoing cash burn as it scales up operations makes it a risky bet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThroughout 2023, Rigetti\u2019s financial status reflected a significant cash burn, a common challenge for companies in the high-tech industry focusing on scaling up operations. For instance, by the end of the first quarter of 2023, Rigetti reported having $26.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease from $57.9 million at the end of 2022\u200b.\n\nAlthough RGTI has a solid balance sheet despite these concerns, it has offloaded much of its financial risk to investors, with outstanding shares ballooning 29% at the time of writing.\n\nHaving one\u2019s ownership decrease by a third is rarely a pleasant sight for investors. It can be argued that RGTI had little choice. However, this is not a symptom of larger quantum computing stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other blue-chips.\n\nThere could be better options than RGIT due to the ongoing share dilution expected.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has a longstanding presence in the quantum computing space and has made significant investments in technology. However, the company\u2019s overall growth has been sluggish, and heavy investments in quantum computing haven\u2019t yet resulted in proportionate financial returns.\n\nI don\u2019t like IBM for a few reasons. It\u2019s a tech stock, but its capital appreciation has been around 10% off some of its growth peers, such as MSFT, over the last five years. IBM is a dividend aristocrat, but its dividend growth rate has declined since 2016; it pays a 4% dividend yield.\n\nIf income is one\u2019s main concern, then there are alternative stocks out there that pay more and at a cheaper valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from its weakness of being a \u201cjack of all trades,\u201d its growth exploration into quantum computing has been disappointing. The company has developed several high-capacity quantum processors, including the 127-qubit IBM Quantum Eagle\u2019 and the 433-qubit \u2018IBM Osprey, marking substantial progress toward overcoming classical computing limitations.\n\nIt\u2019s still a very early stage for the industry, but IBM\u2019s investment has yet to indicate promising returns, let alone the realization of actual ones.\r\n\r\nIn general, IBM is a weird stock in that it fails to fulfill a common need in most people\u2019s portfolios, offering neither strong immediate income, dividend growth or capital appreciation. However, it fits the bill if one seeks a low volatility stock in the tech sector, as it has a beta of 0.7.\n\nD-Wave Systems (QBTS) QBTS stock: Person holding mobile phone with logo of Canadian hardware company D-Wave Systems Inc. on screen in front of web page.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nD-Wave Systems (NYSE:QBTS) focuses on quantum annealing, a specific type of quantum computation. While it has secured high-profile partnerships and clients, the narrow focus on quantum annealing instead of more general quantum computing solutions may limit its market opportunities.\n\nIts focus on this specific solution also represents some concentration and execution risks, as it can\u2019t easily pivot to creating general quantum computing systems without losing what differentiates itself in the first place.\n\nIt has made substantial progress in this arena. This is evident from its deployment of the Advantage2 system, which features a novel qubit design intended to reduce noise and improve performance.\n\nOverall, because the quantum computing industry is speculative, it\u2019s risky for companies with a narrow focus or a pure focus on quantum computing. Blue-chips like MSFT or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) may be better options because of their exposure to the quantum industry without putting all of one\u2019s eggs in a basket or baskets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that AI will become\u00a0a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. Many forecasts put the market even higher in less than 10 years. The explosive growth has made AI stocks red-hot and in demand among investors.\n\nBut caution is needed. Not every company and stock associated with AI is worth an investment of capital. Already, winners and losers are emerging in the AI space. Companies\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pulling ahead while others like C3.ai (NYSE:AI) are being left\u00a0in the dust. The trick for investors is to separate the proverbial wheat from the chafe\u00a0when it comes to AI stocks and the industry\u2019s future.\n\nHere is a stock market crash warning: Don\u2019t get caught holding these three AI stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background.

ADBE stock plunged 12% after the company\u2019s latest financial results\u00a0were issued\u00a0in March. While the company behind popular products such as Photoshop and Illustrator managed to beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, its forward guidance disappointed analysts and investors.\u00a0Through four months of the year,\u00a0Adobe\u2019s stock is down by 16%.\n\nAdobe is doing its best to add AI technologies to its suite of software products. It recently unveiled an AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps.\u00a0However, somewhat ironically, it appears that AI\u00a0is posing\u00a0an existential threat to the company.\u00a0ADBE stock started to sell off last year when privately held\u00a0OpenAI introduced \u201cSora,\u201d an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. Some analysts feel that it is only a matter of time before AI replaces Adobe\u2019s suite of creative software products.\n\nAdobe is now\u00a0looking to partner with OpenAI and add that company\u2019s technology to its software.\u00a0Time will tell if\u00a0success is achieved.\u00a0In the meantime, ADBE stock continues to slide lower.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive.

(NYSE:IBM) is also doing its best to capitalize on the AI craze,\u00a0recently\u00a0announcing\u00a0plans to spend $1 billion expanding its semiconductor packaging and testing plant up north in Canada.\u00a0During this year\u2019s first quarter, IBM provided its army of 160,000 consultants with AI assistants to help boost their productivity. Yet despite its efforts, the AI rollout can\u2019t mask the many problems at the legacy technology company.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM\u2019s stock recently fell 10% after it announced\u00a0mixed financial results and announced that it is acquiring cloud software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion in a deal that\u2019s expected to boost its cloud-computing services.\u00a0Analysts\u00a0seem\u00a0skeptical of the deal and didn\u2019t care\u00a0for\u00a0IBM\u2019s earnings.\u00a0While the technology company beat on its Q1 earnings, it missed on revenue. It was IBM\u2019s third revenue miss in the last five quarters. The stock of IBM is down 13% in the past month, lowering its year-to-date gain to only 2%.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIn early April,\u00a0Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled a new AI microchip called the \u201cGaudi 3\u201d that the company says can be used to train and deploy big AI models and chatbots. Intel claims that its new AI chip is over twice as power-efficient and one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing H100 microchip\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0widely used\u00a0with AI. Intel said\u00a0that the\u00a0new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter of this year, though it didn\u2019t provide a price for the new chip.\n\nTaking\u00a0share from Nvidia in the AI chip market\u00a0will be difficult for Intel. Nvidia currently holds an estimated 75% to 80% share of the AI chip market with its graphics processors, known as GPUs,\u00a0that\u00a0have become the standard for running AI applications and models.\u00a0In March of this year, Nvidia revealed new B100 and B200 GPUs, which are the successors to its smash hit H100 chip and are even more powerful. Intel is also struggling with its transformation into a microchip and semiconductor foundry business.\n\nSince the start of April,\u00a0INTC stock has fallen more than 30%.

        "title": "International Business Machines Corporation Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 2.5% to US$165 in the week after its latest first-quarter results. Revenues were US$14b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$1.72, an impressive 32% ahead of estimates. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for International Business Machines  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, International Business Machines' 18 analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$63.2b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to reduce 2.6% to US$8.65 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$63.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.66 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$181, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values International Business Machines at US$215 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$130. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. For example, we noticed that International Business Machines' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 2.5% growth to the end of 2024 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 5.0% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 9.5% annually for the foreseeable future. So although International Business Machines' revenue growth is expected to improve, it is still expected to grow slower than the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that International Business Machines' revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple International Business Machines analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou still need to take note of risks, for example - International Business Machines has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Adds BMC response and requests for IBM and AT&T comment in paragraph 3, additional context in paragraphs 2-7)\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Blake Brittain\n\nApril 30 (Reuters) -\n\nA federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned a judgment requiring IBM to pay rival BMC Software $1.6 billion, after a judge found IBM improperly replaced BMC's mainframe software at AT&T with its own.\n\nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said a lower court judge's determination concerning liability was in error. Writing for a three-judge panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones said AT&T, one of BMC's biggest clients, had switched to IBM software \"independently\" and that BMC had \"lost out to IBM fair and square.\"\n\nA BMC spokesperson declined to comment. Representatives for IBM and AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAT&T was not a party to the case.\n\nHouston-based BMC develops and licenses proprietary mainframe software products. Under an agreement, IBM can maintain and operate mainframes running BMC software with a \"non-displacement\" provision that limits IBM from switching BMC clients' software to IBM's, the ruling said.\n\nAT&T hired IBM to manage its mainframe operations. BMC's lawsuit in Houston federal court accused IBM of breaching their contract when AT&T abandoned its software for IBM's.\n\nTuesday's ruling overturned U.S. District Judge Gray Miller's\n\n2022 decision\n\nthat IBM owed BMC $1.6 billion in damages for breaking their agreement. Miller said IBM had already secretly agreed to replace BMC's software at AT&T when it negotiated the contract in 2015.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Blake Brittain in Washington Editing by Chris Reese and Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Unlocking IBM (IBM) International Revenues: Trends, Surprises, and Prospects",
        "content": "Have you evaluated the performance of IBM's (IBM) international operations for the quarter ending March 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this technology and consulting company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current global economy, which is more interconnected than ever, a company's success in penetrating international markets is crucial for its financial health and growth journey. Investors must understand a company's dependence on overseas markets, as this offers a window into the company's earnings stability, its ability to benefit from varied economic cycles and its potential for long-term growth.\n\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\n\nUpon examining IBM's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $14.46 billion, showing rise of 1.5%. We will now explore the breakdown of IBM's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n\nExploring IBM's International Revenue Patterns\n\nOf the total revenue, $2.9 billion came from Asia Pacific during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 20.1%. This represented a surprise of +6.08% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $2.73 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $3.2 billion, or 18.4%, and $2.8 billion, or 19.7%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa accounted for 29.7% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $4.3 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -0.04%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $4.3 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe, Middle East and Africa contributed $5.3 billion (30.5%) and $4.3 billion (30.2%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nProjected Revenues in Foreign Markets\n\nWall Street analysts expect IBM to report a total revenue of $15.7 billion in the current fiscal quarter, which suggests an increase of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter. Revenue shares from Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa are predicted to be 18.7% and 30.3%, corresponding to amounts of $2.93 billion and $4.75 billion, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $63.47 billion, which signifies a rise of 2.6% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Asia Pacific at 18.7% ($11.88 billion) and Europe, Middle East and Africa at 30% ($19.01 billion).\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe dependency of IBM on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\n\nWith the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.\n\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\n\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool, comes with an externally validated impressive track record. It effectively utilizes shifts in earnings projections to act as a dependable barometer for forecasting short-term stock price trends.\n\nIBM, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned -12.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 9.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +2.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.50 indicates a change of +5.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.47 billion and $66.28 billion estimates indicate +2.6% and +4.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $14.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.5%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.75%. The EPS surprise was +5.66%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "At first glance, the concept of dividend stocks to buy on the dip might clash with your instincts. Right now, the combination of robust employment and soaring energy prices may have put the brakes on strategies designed to lower the benchmark interest rate.\n\nShould rates move higher, U.S. government bonds \u2013 about as safe of a debt security class as you can get \u2013 may compete with the passive income provided by private enterprises. As good of an organization as top-tier blue chips may be, nothing beats the security of Uncle Sam. Nevertheless, given the tense environment, policymakers might not want to rock the boat.\n\nShould the monetary policy environment more or less remain muted, then corporate-backed passive income may look attractive. In that case, investors should consider these dividend stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nSuperficially, legacy technology juggernaut IBM (NYSE:IBM) seems an awfully risky idea for dividend stocks to buy on the dip. Recently, the company disclosed its first-quarter earnings report. On the bottom line, it produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, beating the consensus target of $1.60. However, it could only muster sales of $14.46 billion, below the projected view of $14.55 billion.\n\nAs well, investors didn\u2019t seem to appreciate Big Blue\u2019s acquisition of cloud software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). IBM announced that it intends to pay $35 per share in cash for HashiCorp. Still, CNBC reports that the deal would be accretive to adjusted EBITDA in the first full year following the closing of the transaction. It will also be accretive to free cash flow in the second year after the closing.\n\nFurther, it doesn\u2019t seem that analyst are respecting the significant acumen that IBM brings to the table, including artificial intelligence. While they start to catch on, you can acquire shares and benefit from the forward annual dividend yield of 3.61%.\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up. Penny Oil Stocks\n\nSource: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs mostly an upstream hydrocarbon specialist, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) fundamentally clashes with modern energy sensibilities. These days, the political and scientific framework is increasingly pushing adoption and integration of renewable energy solutions. However, the geopolitical flashpoints that have sprouted in multiple parts of the world have articulated the importance of hydrocarbons.\n\nWhether we like it or not, the world continues to run on oil. Further, when global supply chains of this vital commodity are disrupted, it could easily spike prices higher. At the same time, the upstream component of the value chain \u2013 the exploration and production cycle \u2013 becomes particularly crucial. Essentially, impacted nations must look for new sources of crude.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts project ConocoPhillips\u2019 sales to hit $59.39 billion on average. That\u2019s only a 1.4% increase from last year. However, the high-side estimate calls for $70.31 billion. That seems far likelier given the geopolitical backdrop.\n\nFor speculators, COP is off from its early April highs. With a forward yield of 2.77%, it could be one of the dividend stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt one point, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) ranked among the most important pharmaceutical companies in the world. I speak of course of the company\u2019s contributions in forwarding a Covid-19 vaccine. However, fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus dramatically faded since early 2022. You can see it in the charts. It\u2019s almost as if the rug was pulled underneath PFE stock.\n\nTo be fair, the descent continues. Since the start of the year, PFE has lost 15% of equity value. In the trailing month, it\u2019s down more than 8%. Now, I don\u2019t necessarily like the idea of catching falling knives. However, the downturn in Pfizer may be overdone \u2013 or close to reaching that point.\n\nAfter all, the company gained valuable insights and experience working with messenger-RNA. It could then springboard the tech to address other critical needs. For now, though, the Covid fallout remains the talking point. Analysts anticipate a 4.1% decline in fiscal 2024 sales to $56.07 billion.\n\nStill, while you\u2019re waiting for the narrative to possibly turn right-side up, Pfizer offers a forward yield of 6.4%. It\u2019s awfully tempting.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: SoundHound AI vs. C3.ai",
        "content": "I like SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN). It's an experienced innovator with a unique position in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, focused on voice-control systems and advanced audio analysis.\n\nI'm also a fan of C3.ai(NYSE: AI). Founded and led by serial innovator Tom Siebel (yes, the namesake innovator behind enterprise software veteran Siebel Systems), C3 develops industry-specific AI solutions for a wide range of target industries.\n\nBut which AI expert would I rather buy right now? Both companies are deeply unprofitable growth stories so far. How can you pick one over the other?\n\nI respect both companies, but only one strikes me as a great buy right now. You can cheat and jump ahead to my disclosure statement below, if you want. You'll find out that I own one of these stocks but not the other. Wink, wink. Nudge, nudge.\n\nHow these companies rely on AI\n\nC3.ai offers a suite of enterprise AI software designed to tackle complex business problems, providing AI solutions tailored for specific industries such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Their broad approach aims to embed AI across a variety of business functions to drive efficiencies and predictive analytics.\n\nSoundHound AI specializes in voice-based AI technologies. Their focus is on developing conversational intelligence that powers voice assistants across diverse markets, from automotive controls and drive-through order windows to consumer electronics and phone-service menu systems. It uses a more advanced voice interpretation system than most rivals, based on deep learning and several layers of AI-powered analytics.\n\nThe competitive landscape\n\nSoundHound AI's holds a very specific niche position in voice AI, including a unique approach to the voice analysis. Hence, it enjoys a distinct position with very little direct competition. Alternative song-identification experts usually prefer a simpler audio analytics approach, based on audio fingerprints of specific recordings. That method didn't prepare Shazam to explore wider business opportunities outside the field of song-matching, while SoundHound AI found new applications for its audio tech in many other businesses.\n\nC3.ai can match its audio-specific opponent's flexibility in many ways. The company's eponymous home page lists 10 specific target industries with specific case studies in 8 sectors. Its machine learning tools can help clients analyze oil reserves, manage supply lines, research new vaccines, add generative AI smarts to manufacturing services, and more.\n\nWhy I'd rather buy SoundHound AI today\n\nIn the end, C3.ai's growth-promoting research and development is less effective than SoundHound AI's.\n\nStory continues\n\nC3.ai puts many man-hours (and machine hours) into developing and fine-tuning each industry-specific solution. SoundHound AI's fundamental platform can serve many different functions with less fine-tuning and expensive packaging of customer-specific solutions.\n\nAnd I already mentioned how sparse the audio analytics field is, giving SoundHound AI room to run. In C3.ai's corner of the AI market, the company butts heads with direct rivals such as IBM(NYSE: IBM), Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW), and Salesforce(NYSE: CRM). It's a mighty group, all pursuing a very large global market for enterprise-oriented AI solutions.\n\nSo SoundHound AI has a much clearer path to long-term growth than C3.ai. It chose to specialize on an ultra-specific technology many years ago, and that decision is paying dividends in the form of a largely unchallenged leadership position today.\n\nFinally, the stock is not as expensive as it looks. SoundHound AI's stock price has more than doubled in 2024, thanks to speculative furor around a modest investment by AI giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). But about half of the speculation-driven price surge has already faded out, and the stock was deeply undervalued before the pop. Today, SoundHound AI's market cap stands at $1.4 billion with a $661 million balance of unfilled order and subscription backlogs in the books. And that backlog doubled in 2023.\n\nAnd there you have it. C3.ai may be a decent investment in the long run, but it faces a brutally competitive market and requires heavy R&D investments to stay relevant. SoundHound AI is deceptively cheap, standing tall in a less rivalry-packed field.\n\nThat's why I own SoundHound AI and not C3.ai. Even if you end up owning both, I think you should take a closer look at the audio expert first.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss what is an annuity for retirement and 15 dividend stocks to buy instead. You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject, and go directly to read What is an Annuity for Retirement? 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead.\n\nFor many Americans approaching retirement age, one of the most significant and potentially anxiety-inducing questions they face is: what is an annuity for retirement? An annuity is an insurance product that provides regular payments and is often included in retirement plans. They are mainly issued by insurance companies, where individuals typically invest a lump sum of money in exchange for a guaranteed income stream for the duration of their life, just like a pension or Social Security benefits. Annuities play an important role in financial planning, considering many Americans are not satisfied with the state of their retirement resources. In fact, a survey conducted by BlackRock revealed that 60% of employees expressed their concern about the possibility of outliving their retirement savings.\n\nDue to high-interest rates and fluctuating market conditions, more and more people are investing in annuities for a reliable source of income during retirement and to mitigate the risk of outliving one\u2019s savings. According to an estimate by an insurance industry group, LIMRA, sales of annuities reached their all-time record high of $385 billion in 2023, showing a remarkable increase of 23% compared to the preceding year. The report further mentioned that the sales set a new record in the fourth quarter of 2023, totaling approximately $115.3 billion. This shows that fixed annuities are a bedrock of retirement planning for millions of Americans, accounting for a significant portion of the nation\u2019s retirement savings. According to a report by Bloomberg, these fixed annuities represent over $3 trillion of the country\u2019s retirement funds.\n\nWhile annuities have remained the top priority of retiree investors, one should keep track of how fast the insurance industry is evolving, with private insurance companies taking over the sector gradually. For this reason, analysts advise investing in stocks and bonds, especially in periods of high-interest rates. Aaron Brown,\u00a0 a former head of financial market research at AQR Capital Management, wrote an article for Bloomberg in 2023 advocating stocks and bonds in retirement planning. He said that diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds have historically delivered a yield of around 4% over the long term, keeping pace with inflation. These portfolios typically have low or no fees and offer high liquidity and flexibility. Over time, they tend to increase in value, even after accounting for inflation, allowing beneficiaries to pass on the legacy to their heirs. Here is what he wrote further:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cInflation-adjusted life annuities have to offer higher rates than 4% for most investors to consider paying the often-high fees, while accepting the loss of liquidity and flexibility (as well as the complexities) of many contracts, and the loss of assets that can be passed along to their heirs.\u201d\n\nWithin investing, dividend growth stocks are known for their reliability, particularly among retirees, as these companies consistently provide investors with steady streams of income. Retirees worried about what is an annuity for retirement should consider investing in dividend growth stocks. We have previously covered strong dividend payers for investors nearing their retirement age in Early Retirement Portfolio: 16 Stocks to Live Off Dividends Revisited. In another article on the subject, we reported how dividend growers have delivered strong returns over the years while providing a hedge against market downturns. The report mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 69.34% of the time during down months and around 43.6% of the time during up months.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend growers to consider for retirement as these companies hold decades-long dividend growth streaks and have strong balance sheets. In this article, we will further take a look at some dividend stocks to buy instead of annuities. What is an Annuity for Retirement? 15 Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead\n\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nWe compiled this list by examining Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 hedge funds, as of Q4 2023 and identifying companies that have consistently increased their dividends for a minimum of 15 consecutive years.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI have really hated this earnings season, and it has just begun.\n\nThere have been a few bright spots, no doubt.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta told me it will be a spring and summer of innovation. Think more power-packed Gatorade powders and tablets for workout freaks like yours truly. Let's do this!\n\nSpeaking of workouts, Chipotle (CMG) CFO Jack Hartung told Yahoo Finance that he's OK with the chain being the go-to post fat-burning sessions. He was responding to a new WSJ article that suggested workout buffs are supporting the chain's higher prices.\n\nThen Snowflake's (SNOW) new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, squeezed in an AI product drop ahead of its earnings. He promised that the cloud computing company would be picking up the pace on artificial intelligence innovations this year, aiming to satisfy the Street's appetite for newness.\n\nRamaswamy also called Yahoo Finance \"iconic.\"\n\nWe appreciate that, Sridhar \u2014 and we certainly agree!\n\nBut all in all, I have hated this earnings season.\n\nWhy? Because of all the bad news that is piling up and catching investors off guard.\n\nSurprises have been all over the place.\n\nFor instance, one of the early themes this season is higher-than-expected costs for businesses. And it\u2019s not just UPS (UPS) calling out rising gas prices and the return of fuel surcharges or PepsiCo saying inflation is still in their pipeline.\n\nIt\u2019s Chipotle seeing higher tech costs to support new restaurant software. Investments like this (and wage increases) held back profits in the first quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s Meta (META) materially lifting its full-year capital expenditures guidance and hinting at even bigger spending in 2025 \u2014 all because of unknown AI projects. This surprised shareholders and Mark Zuckerberg fans alike.\n\nIt\u2019s Ford (F) losing lots of money on EVs because of higher-than-expected costs.\n\nThen there is the weakness emanating from forward-looking sectors such as truckers and railroads.\n\nTrucker J.B. Hunt (JBHT) had this to say on the economic backdrop: \"We continue to face inflationary cost pressures despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure.\" Brutal acknowledgment. The stock was hammered.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) stated that the last two years have \"felt\" like the 2009 recession.\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC) had this to say this week: \"We expect continued mixed impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic non-premium Intermodal pricing.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, IBM (IBM) CFO Jim Kavanaugh struck a more cautious note when I asked him about soft sales at its lucrative consulting business.\n\n\"We still see very good demand out in the marketplace around large transformational deals, digital transformation,\" Kavanaugh said. \"We had our largest first quarter in consulting signings in many years. So the demand profile is out there. Our AI bookings for consulting in the first quarter doubled all of 2023.\"\n\n\"But what we're seeing, just given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, is ... a tightening of discretionary spending, no different than Accenture and all the other consulting companies that are impacting the short-term revenue realization.\u201d\n\nMarkets have responded in kind to the dose of badness.\n\n\"I really think this is actually a dip buying opportunity. It's never fun to live through it, but these are normal pullbacks,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\n\nThought I would leave you on a happy note.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nDespite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.\n\nApple Strikes Back with AI Plans\n\nFor example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will \"come back\" as the company is expected to provide more \"clarity\" and \"visibility\" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iOS 18.\n\nThe net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to \"warm up\" to the opportunity of Apple's \"AI upgrade cycle.\"\n\nA New AI-Focused ETF Craze\n\nRetail investors as well as hedge funds are piling into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. A Bloomberg report recently highlighted a latest trend in Taiwan where people are investing their entire savings in AI-focused ETFs. Bloomberg data shows that Taiwanese have invested a whopping $50 billion in ETFs tracking local stocks. This is up about 80% from the year-ago period. Most of this surge came after the AI boom started. Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the top supplier of chips to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock price surge by over 60% over the past one year.\n\nAI Stocks Have More Room to Run, BlackRock Strategist Says\n\nDespite all these gains, analysts believe AI stocks are just getting started. BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li recently said that earnings trajectory and guidance of companies show that this is a \"forward-looking\" market when it comes to AI. She said that many companies, including the ones in the Magnificent Seven group, were punished because of their guidance or earnings because the \"bar\" has been raised. She expects AI opportunities beyond just the tech sector, and mentioned healthcare, financials and industrials.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Opportunities in Datacenter and Utilities\n\nData center and utilities companies are the biggest examples of the spillover effects of AI gains. Power demand and data center solutions will see a huge rise in the coming months and years as AI software solutions go live, to be used by millions of users worldwide. Electricity company Exelon's CEO Calvin Butler recently said that AI would drive a 900% increase in power demand from data centers in the Chicago area.\n\nData center company Vertiv in its latest earnings call talked about how it's seeing AI-related momentum in its business:\n\n\"We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months.\n\nWe are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead.\n\nSupply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that\u2019s where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we\u2019re executing reflect that yet.\n\nThere is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here. American Politicians are Buying These AI Stocks\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nIt's not just the hedge funds or retail investors that piling into AI stocks. In this article we decided to see which AI stocks American politicians like. For that we used publicly available data of American Congress members and senators and picked 10 AI stocks that saw buying from politicians in the US over the past few months. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to see what Washington insiders, corporate executives and hedge funds are buying? \u00a0Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nIBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks that have strong growth catalysts because of the AI boom. Earlier this year, investment firm Evercore called IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) an \"overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption.\" On March 11, Congressman Lloyd Doggett bought\u00a0a stake in IBM Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:IBM)\u00a0worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then, IBM Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:IBM)\u00a0shares have declined by 5%.\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOther bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and\u00a0International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM\u2019s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.\u201d\n\n9. Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nSemiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN)\u00a0is one of the companies that can benefit from the AI boom. Republican Congressman Kevin Hern on February 13 bought\u00a0shares of Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN)\u00a0worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then the stock has gained about 5.5%.\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 funds reported having stakes in Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN). The biggest stakeholder of Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN)\u00a0during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which had a $728 million stake in Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cShares of semiconductor manufacturing company\u00a0Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company\u2019s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.\u201d\n\n8. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 77\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) saw interest from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most important politician in America when it comes to stock trading. Pelosi's spouse on February 21 bought\u00a0call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PANW)\u00a0worth between $100,001 - $250,000\u00a0with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of 1/17/25.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGiven our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in\u00a0Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.\u201d\n\n7. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks seventh in our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to American Congress members.\n\nEarlier this month, Benchmark started covering Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) was positioned well to capitalize on the trend of moving artificial intelligence workloads towards edge computing. On February 12, Congressman Earl Blumenauer bought\u00a0a stake worth between $1,000 to $15,000 in Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM). Since then through April 22 Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM)\u00a0shares have gained about 5.4%.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.\u201d\n\n6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 91\n\nOn January 25, Congressman Josh Gottheimer bought\u00a0a stake worth between $1000 to $15,000 in ServiceNow Inc\u00a0(NYSE:NOW). Since then the stock is up about 2%.\n\nIn December, Macquarie Equity Research increased its price target for ServiceNow Inc\u00a0(NYSE:NOW)\u00a0to $800 from $612, citing generative AI potential.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in Adobe and\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nInsiders are Amassing These 10 Stocks in April 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer 10 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "content": "Quantum computing technology and applications across sectors are advancing rapidly; the market is predicted to grow over 32% from 2023 to 2030, attracting attention toward multibagger quantum computing stocks.\n\nFurthermore, industry developments such as IBM\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) 433-qubit Osprey processor represent a substantial advancement in quantum computing, enabling complicated calculations beyond traditional computers.\n\nAmidst this, an investor may wonder how to buy multibagger quantum computing stocks. Compared to IBM and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), there is huge potential for reward and a little commitment when it comes to penny stocks. Moreover, the three multibagger quantum computing stocks we shall examine promise up to triple-digit potential. Today we\u2019re looking at stocks that offer strong gross margins, solid pioneering achievements and major quarterly performance advances.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQuantum Computing (QUBT) A digital rendering of a circuit board and digital chip in neon colors to illustrate quantum computing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nQuantum Computing (NASDAQ:QUBT) creates low-cost nanophotonics-based quantum-tech industrial products.\n\nThe penny play, one of the most inexpensive multibagger quantum computing stocks, is down 15% in 2024. However, its strong gross margins of 45% are greater than 84% of its industry\u2019s, even though the company is losing money.\n\nMost notably, through its quantum optimization platform, Dirac-3, QUBT is a leader in the field. Another creation of QUBT is the Quantum Photonic Vibrometer. Better vibration detection, perception and analysis are possible with the first quantum-accelerated photonics vibrometer. This business and military gadget detects explosives and hidden weapons up to 30 inches below the surface.\n\nFurthermore, the company has expanded its CRADA to include use case testing using the Dirac-1 Entropy Quantum Computer at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nThe company was subcontracted by the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute to develop and test a photonic sensor for NASA Ames. This sensor enhances the company\u2019s NASA relationship by measuring the size, form and chemistry of clouds, aerosols and volcanic ash.\u200b\n\nA fourth NASA grant was given to QUBT to use entropy quantum computing to denoise LiDAR spectrum data. This technology is needed for NASA missions in order to provide accurate measurements for observation and exploration at any time of day.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (QBTS) QBTS stock: Person holding mobile phone with logo of Canadian hardware company D-Wave Systems Inc. on screen in front of web page.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nQuantum computing gear, software and services provider D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) reported strong revenue and bookings last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales rose 21% in Q4 and 22% in 2023. Q4 bookings up 34% and FY 89% year-over-year. Like QUBT, this penny stock will fluctuate.\n\nEven though sales and bookings grew by more than 10%, QBTS didn\u2019t do better than experts expected. Earnings per share were -0.09, which was about 10% less than expected. There was a selloff because sales were 38% lower than expected, at $2.9 million instead of $4.7 million.\n\nMoving towards its latest tech moves, the 1,200+ qubit D-Wave Advantage2 prototype is now available via its Leap Quantum Cloud Service. This prototype\u2019s stacked superconducting integrated circuit manufacturing stack reduces noise. Complex applications like machine learning benefit from 20 times quicker optimization.\n\nMoreover, D-Wave demonstrated quantum spin glass flow on over 5,000 qubits. This advances its annealing and gate-type quantum computer. Advantage2 should have over 7,000 qubits.\n\nNo superconducting qubit on the market has better coherence than D-Wave\u2019s fluxonium qubits. Gate model quantum computing systems improve fluxonium qubits. This will impact D-Wave\u2019s quantum technology.\n\nThe consensus on QBTS stock is \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d and its 80% growth potential points to a rebound.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) IBM Q System One Quantum Computer at the Consumer Electronic Show CES 2020. Quantum computing stocks.\n\nSource: Boykov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last of our top quantum computing multibaggers is Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI). Similar to the previous two penny stocks, however, its last quarter was better than expected, giving it some brownie points.\n\nRGTI\u2019s sales of $3.38 million exceeded estimates by 10%. Its EPS came in at a loss of $0.04 instead of $0.06, 32% better than anticipated.\n\nIn terms of innovation, Rigetti\u2019s 84-qubit Ankaa-2 quantum computer makes mistakes 2.5 times less often than older QPUs. This is what made it a success when it came to operation and sales. The company got 98% of the time with two qubits correctly, which means the quantum bits worked well together.\n\nRigetti also wants to make quantum computing easier to access by combining the 9-qubit Novera QPU with existing systems.\n\nInternationally, Oxford Instruments NanoScience and Rigetti UK recently completed a project to construct one of the first UK quantum computers. Horizon Quantum Computing also got a Rigetti Novera QPU for a hardware testbed in Singapore so that it can grow in the Asia-Pacific region, which is the fastest-growing quantum computing market.\n\nThe upside potential is significant at 170%, with a consensus recommendation of \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Finding opportunities for a steady and high return is crucial before the next market boom. Three exceptional businesses provide attractive opportunities in various industries.\n\nLeading the aerospace and military industries, the first one gains from significant revenue growth fueled by important government contracts. The corporation has secured its place as a top performer in the industry by receiving more money for essential initiatives with the passage of the FY2024 defense budget. Similarly, the second one takes advantage of the expanding market for smokeless oral goods, which is expanding significantly in both the Japanese and American markets. The company\u2019s dominance in this market indicates consumers gravitate toward healthier options.\n\nIn the meantime, the third one demonstrates resilience and growth in hybrid solutions while showcasing its strength in IT infrastructure. The firm is positioned as a dependable investment option due to its capacity to adjust to changing market needs. Furthermore, the third company\u2019s robust free cash flow allows it to make calculated investments, improving its long-term growth prospects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach firm\u2019s strategic efforts and market positioning highlight this potential, making them appealing investment options for astute investors.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE:LMT) net sales increased significantly to $17.2 billion from $15.1 billion in the same period the previous year. This significant rise shows the company\u2019s capacity to produce large amounts of income over an extended period. With a healthy backlog of $159 billion, the firm demonstrated a solid fit between the goals and priorities of its customers and its cutting-edge technological solutions. A sizable backlog suggests a robust pipeline of potential future revenue-generating projects.\n\nMoreover, adopting the\u00a0FY2024 defense budget favors Lockheed Martin since it provides funds for several important initiatives the firm depends on, including multi-year munitions acquisition, hypersonics and secret operations. The financial additions for projects like the C-130 and F-35 aircraft further strengthened Lockheed Martin\u2019s growth prospects, including supporting important initiatives such as F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M, and others.\n\nLastly, Lockheed Martin\u2019s global market reach is demonstrated by agreements to provide\u00a0F-35 aircraft to the Czech Republic, Turkey, and Singapore, among other countries. Hence, these agreements show that Lockheed Martin\u2019s goods and services are in high demand abroad, broadening its sources of income outside of its home country.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nZYN nicotine pouches, an oral smoke-free product from Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), have grown remarkably. One vital trend is the significant development in ZYN nicotine pouch shipping volume. The number of can shipments increased by 79.7% year-over-year (YoY) to reach 131.6 million in the U.S. This significant increase demonstrates the high customer demand for ZYN products and their rising status in the oral smoke-free product market.\n\nAdditionally, ZYN has consecutive gains in market share within the oral nicotine pouch category in the United States. The company\u2019s share in the category rose to\u00a0over 74% for the fourth consecutive quarter, a sequential rise of 1.3 percentage points. The increase in market share and the dominance of Philip Morris in the area of oral smoke-free products are demonstrated by the statistics.\n\nFinally, Japan is a crucial market for Philip Morris\u2019 IQOS products, as the company has seen a significant rise in market share in that nation. Hence, IQOS increased its market share significantly in Japan, rising by more than three percentage points to\u00a0above 29%.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt constant currency, the IBM (NYSE:IBM) infrastructure segment\u2019s revenue increased by 0.2%, with hybrid infrastructure driving the majority of the rise at 6%. Revenue from IBM Z, the company\u2019s flagship hardware product, increased by 5%, demonstrating the ongoing demand for IBM\u2019s mainframe solutions.\n\nAdditionally, distributed infrastructure fared well, growing at a pace of 7% at constant currency. IBM\u2019s infrastructure division exhibits growth and durability, especially in hybrid solutions. Thus, IBM Z\u2019s robust performance highlights its continued significance in the AI age, particularly for real-time AI-inferencing workloads.\n\nMoreover, in Q1 2024, IBM generated $1.9 billion in free cash flow, a notable $600 million increase annually. During the previous 12 months, IBM generated $11.8 billion in free cash flow, putting the business in a strong position for further investment and strategic objectives. Hence,\u00a0its constant generation of large free cash flows demonstrates IBM\u2019s potential for reinvestment and financial stability.\n\nIn summary, IBM\u2019s financial stability is preserved by\u00a0pursuing\u00a0strategic acquisitions, including the upcoming\u00a0acquisition of HashiCorp, thanks to its robust cash flow.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in PM.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With inflation up, economic growth down and two-year Treasury yields testing 5%, Bill Gross sensed the music in markets was fading, and said it was time to get over the likes of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPlunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin\u2019s Glow Is Fading Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Fed\u2019s Preferred Core Inflation Gauge Rose at Brisk Pace in March Huawei\u2019s New Phone Runs Latest Version of Made-in-China Chip Billionaire Stephen Ross Believes in South Florida\u2014and Is Spending Big to Transform It\n\n\u201cStick to value stocks,\u201d the Pacific Investment Management co-founder posted Thursday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cAvoid tech for now.\u201d\n\nJust a day later, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index notched its best session since February after Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. showed the AI earnings bonanza still has juice.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest gut-check for anyone trying to get a handle on the short-term moves of markets, just as new questions emerge about the viability of an economic soft landing. An ETF riding the momentum trade shot up 3.5% this week, after plunging 5.6% in the previous week.\n\nMacro signals continue to confound. Growth eased more than expected, a report showed Thursday, yet indicators of consumption and investment remain constructive. A day later strong personal-spending data was duly cheered by economic bulls, while raising the eyebrows of inflation hawks.\n\nUndeterred, money managers just pushed the S&P 500 more than 2.5% higher on the week as they continue to pay through the nose for companies that promise to post profits in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cTech/growth used to be affected by higher yields,\u201d Gross wrote in an email to Bloomberg on Friday. \u201cBut not for now.\u201d\n\nWith swings in stocks and Treasuries elevated, money managers sharing the bond king\u2019s caution have been rushing to hedge richly priced equities via exchange-traded funds. Meta Platforms Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., for example, lost $150 billion in market value combined on Thursday alone.\n\nYet even as traders price out the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-year monetary pivot \u2014 pressuring yields higher \u2014 risky assets remain remarkably stable. And recent market moves along with mixed economic data are providing a lesson in humility for swaths on Wall Street. Thursday\u2019s GDP report was especially jarring, showing growth a scant 1.6% and core inflation at 3.7%, both outside the predictions of all the estimates in Bloomberg surveys.\n\n\u201cThe recent spate of hotter-than-expected inflation data is throwing a wrench in most people\u2019s models. It\u2019s always difficult to spot inflection points in markets,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be humble and admit that you don\u2019t know which way things will go, so we have to talk about the importance of diversification and some tail risk hedges.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nA week after sliding 5.4%, the Nasdaq 100 bounced back to climb 4%, including a 3.3% gain in its seven mightiest stocks on Friday alone. Investors who had been bailing from equities and junk bonds found themselves diving back in this week, according to Bank of America citing EPFR Global.\n\nResilience was the theme of the week in every market except Treasuries, where yields hovered at multi-month highs. Interest-coverage ratios have improved for both investment-grade and junk bonds amid strong earnings and lingering bets on monetary easing, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. The ratio between companies\u2019 earnings and their interest expense is starting to rise again, signaling they have more income to service their debt.\n\nFor William Hobbs, head of UK multi-asset wealth at Barclays Wealth Management, this was an opportunity to buy the dip and tilt the broader portfolio in favor of risk.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the box office start to the year for many developed stock markets, our proprietary measures of investor sentiment and positioning are not close to flashing red,\u201d Hobbs said.\n\nYet, signs of anxiety were brewing amid a week of uneven earnings results, with the drops in Meta and IBM more than offset by weekly gains of 12% in Google parent Alphabet and a 14% rally in Tesla Inc. The Cboe NDX Volatility Index \u2014 a gauge of option costs tied to the Nasdaq 100 \u2014 has been hovering around 20 after spiking to its highest level since October last week.\n\nConsensus forecasts still put net margins for the tech sector at all-time highs by the end of 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This is one reason risk assets have continued to defy threats from rising bond yields even as their valuations and expected cash flows are influenced by interest-rate changes. The result this week: a trouncing of value stocks by their growth counterparts.\n\nYet all this threatens to set up fresh stock-bond clashes ahead, with Fed officials gathering next week against the backdrop of a red-hot Wall Street and stubborn price pressures.\n\n\u201cTighter financial conditions are appropriate to cool a booming US economy,\u201d said Tiffany Wilding, economist at Pimco. \u201cBased on recent comments, the Fed appears poised to deliver, by remaining on hold for longer. In other words, the pivot party is over.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Ye Xie and Emily Graffeo.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea\u2019s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Reported EPS is $1.68, expectations were $1.59. International Business Machines Corporation isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Olympia McNerney, IBM's Global Head of Investor Relations. Olympia, you may begin.\n\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's first quarter 2024 earnings presentation. I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website.\n\nFinally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna: Thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we had solid performance across revenue and cash flow. These results are further proof of the quality of our portfolio and our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We had good performance in software at the high end of our model, continued strength in infrastructure above our model, while consulting was below model. On a relative basis, consulting outperformed the market. Our cash flow generation is the strongest first quarter level we have reported in many years. This performance speaks to the strength of our diversified business model. Before we get into more detail on the quarter, let me address the announcement of our agreement to acquire HashiCorp, a company we have partnered with for a long time and believe is a tremendous strategic fit with IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure applications across public and private clouds, as well as on-prem environments, making this the ideal time to pursue this acquisition. As generative AI deployment accelerates alongside traditional workloads, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies. HashiCorp has a proven track record of helping clients manage the complexity of today's infrastructure by automating, orchestrating and securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp is a great strategic addition to our portfolio, extending Red Hat's hybrid cloud capabilities to provide end-to-end automated infrastructure and security lifecycle management.\n\nHashiCorp's technology is foundational to enabling the transition to hybrid and multi-cloud, and Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure automation for these environments. With security top of mind for every enterprise, Vault is a powerful secrets management offering to automate identity security across applications. The combination will also bolster our leading IT automation platform to address the sprawling complexity of AI-driven application and infrastructure growth. HashiCorp's products have wide scale adoption in the developer community, highlighting the pervasive nature of their technology, used by over 85% of the Fortune 500 and downloaded over 0.5 billion times. The acquisition of HashiCorp builds on IBM's commitment to industry collaboration, the developer community, and open source hybrid cloud and AI innovation.\n\nToday's acquisition is consistent with our M&A strategy. We have taken a disciplined approach to M&A and HashiCorp aligns well across all our key criteria to continue to focus and strengthen our portfolio on hybrid cloud and AI, deliver synergies with rest of IBM and be near-term accretive to free cash flow. I will now turn it to Jim to discuss the financial implications.\n\nJames Kavanaugh: Thank you, Arvind. Let me start with the details of the transaction. We have agreed to acquire HashiCorp for $6.4 billion in enterprise value to be funded by cash on hand. The transaction was approved by HashiCorp's Board of Directors. Closing is anticipated by the end of 2024, subject to approval by HashiCorp's shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We have been executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy and the acquisition of HashiCorp meets all of our criteria, including strategic fit, as Arvind just walked through, synergies across IBM and financial accretion. Let me start by addressing synergies. We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp.\n\nProduct synergies span across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible automation Platforms, configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. We are well positioned to drive growth for HashiCorp by leveraging IBM's enterprise incumbency and global reach. With 70% of their revenue today coming from the U.S., the opportunity to scale HashiCorp across IBM's operations in 175 countries is significant. We also believe we can accelerate HashiCorp's adoption with IBM clients. To put this in perspective, only about 20% of the Forbes Global 2000 are HashiCorp customers, and just a quarter of HashiCorp customers result in more than 100,000 annual recurring revenue, underscoring the opportunity to better monetize and upsell their products.\n\nBringing it all together, the acquisition allows us to deliver a more comprehensive hybrid cloud offering to enterprise clients, enhancing IBM's ability to capture global cloud opportunity. This will drive a higher growth profile over time. Finally, we expect to realize operating efficiencies and expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA within the first full year post close and to free cash flow in year two. Significant near-term cost synergies underpin the financial profile of the transaction, while product synergies represent further upside. We are very comfortable with our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile and solid investment-grade rating and remain committed to our dividend policy. I'll now turn it back to Arvind.\n\nArvind Krishna: Now, turning back to the quarter, let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. We expect the global economy to behave similarly to last year, albeit with some uncertainty due to persistently high interest rates. There are reasons to believe technology will be even more important in 2024 as clients focus on productivity improvements and customer experience. AI-driven productivity in particular continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. I will now provide some details on the execution of our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI. Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. This year, we anticipate more clients moving from experimenting to deploying AI at scale to unlock productivity.\n\nWe are pleased with the solid progress of our AI offerings. Each quarter, we are winning more clients, expanding partnerships and introducing new innovations. Inception to date, our book of business related to watsonx and generative AI is greater than $1 billion with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Similar to last quarter, this remains weighted towards consulting. We believe our comprehensive AI strategy is well positioned to help clients scale AI. We developed our watsonx platform for clients to build their AI solutions, spanning from foundation model training to data preparation and governance. This includes both IBM Granite models and third-party models, giving our clients variety, as well as the efficiency and focus on enterprise domains that IBM brings.\n\nWe have leveraged watsonx to build AI assistance through our software portfolio. Our consultants are helping clients navigate the AI landscape. And finally, we are seeing our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Let me touch on these infrastructure dynamics briefly. As AI becomes widely adopted, IBM Z is uniquely advantaged. We believe a lot of AI inferencing will happen where the data is for security, efficiency and latency reasons. Our full stack focus from on-chip AI processing to AI accelerator cards to watsonx platform support allows models to be built and [create] (ph) on any platform and easily deployed on IBM Z. The Telum chip is a unique differentiator, enabling real-time AI inferencing.\n\nGenerative AI is also driving lift for our storage offerings, where industry-leading performance and scalability is utilized for data curation, model building and fine tuning. For enterprises to deploy AI at scale, AI is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It requires tuned, domain-specific models trained with quality data to maximize its impact. Clients value the flexibility of our approach. They appreciate having the ability to leverage a combination of AI models, whether they are IBM's, their own models, open source models such as Llama from Meta and Mixtral from Mistral, and they can deploy these AI models across multiple environments. The flexibility we offer is resonating as there are use cases for both large and more efficient models.\n\nWe are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. We see early parallels to Linux in making open source AI models performant for enterprise use. We believe that IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open source AI. As you know, we have done a lot of work with AI models and recently released a family of state-of-the-art open source code models from our Granite series. Red Hat and IBM also recently launched InstructLab to evolve and improve AI models through incremental community contributions much like open source software. This open strategy is resonating around the world. We recently announced a collaboration with the Spanish government to leverage IBM's investments across the entire AI stack and open source to build the world's leading suite of foundation models proficient in the Spanish language.\n\nEnterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor remain top of mind for our clients. This quarter, we signed a multi-year contract with Providence Health to reimagine talent and HR workflows with AI from IBM and partners. We're also providing data-driven insights and enabling Spanish language narration for this year's Masters Golf Tournament. Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth. This quarter, we progressed strategic partnerships with a number of industry leaders, consulting joint forces with Nvidia to accelerate clients' AI journeys. ServiceNow will embed watsonx AI capabilities into the ServiceNow platform to accelerate enterprise digital transformation. We also expanded our relationship with Adobe around OpenShift and watsonx as it relates to the Adobe Experience platform.\n\nWe continue to invest in emerging technology as well, bringing new innovations to the market. Since we put the world's first quantum system on the cloud in 2016, we have deployed over 80 quantum systems and our users have run over 3 trillion programs to date. We just installed a Quantum System One at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This is the first IBM Quantum System on a college campus anywhere in the world. This installation will advance research in critical areas such as energy storage, material science and financial modeling. As always, focusing our portfolio remains a key priority. We closed the sale of The Weather Company in the first quarter and expect to close the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG by mid-year. A closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nOverall, we had a positive start to the year, which gives us confidence in our next quarter and full year expectations. Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.\n\nJames Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. In the first quarter, we delivered $14.5 billion in revenue, $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, $1.7 billion of operating pre-tax income and $1.68 operating earnings per share, and we generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up approximately $600 million year-over-year. Our revenue for the quarter was up 3% at constant currency. We saw an impact to our top-line performance from the closing of The Weather Company earlier than expected in the quarter. Software grew by 6% with growth across hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing and continued strength in our recurring revenue base. Consulting was up 2%, reflecting organic growth. We continue to have solid signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of over 1.15.\n\nInfrastructure had strong performance, delivering growth across all of our hardware offerings. Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 130 basis points over last year, inclusive of about 100 basis point currency headwind to pre-tax margin. At the end of January, we closed on the divestiture of The Weather Company, generating a pre-tax gain of $241 million in the quarter. Mitigating that benefit, we took charges of $374 million to address workforce rebalancing. Operating pre-tax margin was up 50 basis points, excluding the year-over-year impacts of workforce rebalancing and divestiture dynamics. We are pleased with this performance, in line with our guidance of roughly 50 basis points of operating pre-tax margin improvement in 2024.\n\nMargin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. This allowed for continued investments to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense. The timing of discrete tax items this quarter resulted in an operating tax rate of about 6%. We are still expecting a full year operating tax rate consistent with last year. Overall, the combination of our revenue and operating margin performance resulted in 7% growth in our adjusted EBITDA. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $600 million year-over-year. This growth reflects the performance of our underlying business with adjusted EBITDA up $200 million year-over-year and about $400 million from timing of balance sheet dynamics and CapEx. Over the last 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $11.8 billion.\n\nThis puts us on track to deliver about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, with the growth largely driven by adjusted EBITDA. Since our acquisition of Red Hat, excluding 2021, when we spun off Kyndryl, our operating net income to free cash flow realization averaged 120%. Two factors drive this. One is stock-based compensation, which today represents 15 points of realization. And two, given the shift in our portfolio to a growing software business, deferred income also contributes to our realization. In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $19.3 billion, up from $13.5 billion at year end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was $59.5 billion, including $9.9 billion from our financing business.\n\nTurning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6% with good performance across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and transaction processing. As mentioned in January, the Software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, acquisitions, strong recurring revenue and transaction processing. And this is just how the first quarter played out. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 7%. Let me spend a minute on the various elements. Red Hat revenue grew 9%, reflecting solid performance across the three key solutions, RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Annual bookings growth was again in the mid-teens, with OpenShift up over 40% this quarter and RHEL and Ansible each up double digits. Beyond Red Hat, recent acquisitions contributed to the growth profile of Hybrid Platform & Solutions, as did new innovation areas including watsonx.\n\nThe combination of Apptio acquired mid last year and our IT automation portfolio has delivered strong results, unlocking the full benefits of a FinOps solution for technology investments across hybrid cloud environments. In fact, just this quarter, we partnered with Microsoft to bring Apptio to Azure and will co-sell to our joint customers and Microsoft has agreed to adopt Apptio's capabilities in parts of their organization. Our revenue performance continues to reflect growth in our high-value recurring revenue base. Our ARR, after removing The Weather Company and security services, is now $13.9 billion, up over 8% since last year. Transaction processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms.\n\nAnd there's an increasing interest in generative AI application modernization capabilities like watsonx Code Assistant for Z. Software segment profit was up 80 basis points, while absorbing both key investments in innovation and about 1 point of currency impact in the quarter. We continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance this quarter. Our Consulting revenue was up 2%. We continue to see clients prioritizing large data and technology transformation projects focused on driving productivity with AI and analytics. These results reflect the organic performance of our business. Solid demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 4%, our highest absolute first quarter signings in recent history, and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15.\n\nOur overall backlog remains healthy, up 7% year-over-year, and backlog erosion levels remain stable. At the same time, we saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tighten discretionary spending. Contributing to growth across the business this quarter, our strategic partnerships continue to make up over 40% of our consulting revenue, with both AWS and Azure practices growing double digits. Additionally, our Red Hat practice grew revenue double digits. Expanding upon our partnerships, we are leveraging Microsoft Copilot to drive productivity for our clients. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful book of business around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are ahead of pace at this stage with our generative AI book of business.\n\nTurning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 3%, led by supply chain and finance transformations. Customer experience transformations also contributed to growth. Technology Consulting revenue was also up 3% with double-digit growth in cloud modernization projects and both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements delivered double-digit growth. Application Operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management projects, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. Moving to consulting profit, we delivered over 8% of segment profit margin, which is flat year to year. Our segment profit margin was impacted by about a point of currency, offsetting improvements in pricing and productivity actions we have taken.\n\nMoving to Infrastructure, revenue grew, reflecting growth in Hybrid Infrastructure of 6% and declines in Infrastructure Support of 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, growth was broad based with strong demand from our hardware offerings across IBM Z, power and storage. In IBM Z, revenue was up 5% in the eighth quarter of z16 product availability. Now, two years in, this product cycle continues to resonate with clients and surpass z15 revenue performance. IBM Z is uniquely positioned for AI with the first processor design with on-chip acceleration for real-time AI inferencing. In fact, we are working with over 100 clients on the application of AI on z16. Use cases range from fraud detection to anti-money laundering to anomaly detection. This remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption, but also related software, storage and services.\n\nDistributed Infrastructure delivered 7% revenue growth with strength in both power and storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads. Storage delivered strong double-digit revenue growth, including demand for high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle. And clients are also looking to our storage offerings for data curation, model building and fine tuning in support of generative AI. Looking at Infrastructure Profit, we deliver both gross profit and segment profit margin expansion. Segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing about a point of impact from currency. Now, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. More than two years into our mid-term model, we are a more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue and free cash flow growth.\n\nOver this time, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem, and drive productivity across our business. Our first quarter performance is another proof point of this progress with constant currency revenue growth, operating gross margin and operating pre-tax margin expansion and the strongest first quarter free cash flow in many years. Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on our two primary metrics, revenue and free cash flow. We see full year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA.\n\nOn the segments, in software, we had a solid start to the year and continue to expect growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations. Though as I said, we are seeing some pressure on smaller, more discretionary projects. We now see mid-single-digit revenue growth in consulting with acceleration throughout the year. Given our ongoing productivity initiatives and investment in innovation, we expect to see about a point of segment profit margin expansion in both of these segments. And in Infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect revenue to decline, driving about a half a point impact to our overall growth. Given IBM Z cycle dynamics, we expect segment profit margin to be lower year over year.\n\nWith these segment dynamics, we continue to expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about a half a point year to year, consistent with our view 90 days ago, and we are maintaining our view of operating tax for the year to be consistent with last year in the mid teens range. We took a workforce rebalancing charge this quarter and, as I mentioned 90 days ago, we continue to see the overall amount this year consistent with last year. We expect this to pay back by the end of the year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 150 basis point to 200 basis point impact to revenue growth for the year, which is about one point worse than 90 days ago. For the second quarter, I expect our constant currency revenue growth rate to be consistent with the full year.\n\nOur tax rate is expected to be in the high teens. And for profit, we expect the first half skew of net income will remain a couple points ahead of the prior year. In closing, we are pleased with our performance to start the quarter. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit margin and grow free cash flow for the year. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\n\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best technology dividend aristocrats to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of tech dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Technology Dividend Aristocrats to Buy.\n\nMeta\u2019s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year took the tech world by storm. However, this is not the first time any company has initiated a dividend from the sector which is typically recognized for prioritizing buybacks over dividend payouts.\u00a0 According to a report by Goldman Sachs\u2019 portfolio strategy team, slightly less than 40% of the technology companies within the broad-market S&P Composite 1500 distribute dividends. Moreover, some tech stocks are offering dividend yields as high as 3%, which is generally considered very healthy according to analysts.\n\nAlso read:\n\n15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nDividend distribution within the tech sector has grown gradually over the years. In 2011, only one in four tech stocks paid dividends to shareholders. Over the past decade, there has been a shift in this trend due to investors showing more interest in dividend-paying equities. A report by S&P Global revealed that as of 2020, 26 companies started paying dividends within the tech sector of the S&P 500, while 59 companies raised their payouts at different times throughout the years. This resulted in a total of 376 dividend increases within the sector. The report also mentioned that over this period, as more Information Technology companies initiated dividends, their impact on the total return of the S&P 500 increased from 9.07% in 2009 to 16.33% in 2019.\n\nIrrespective of the industry, dividend growers have always taken the lead among investors when it comes to investing in dividend stocks. In the case of technology dividend stocks, some might assume that these companies simply maintain their dividends without following any consistent growth. However, this assumption does not hold true, as many technology and tech-related companies are actually known for regularly growing their payouts. According to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, tech companies within the S&P 1500 index have nearly quadrupled the total dollar value of their dividends by 2022 in comparison to what they paid in 2011. This growth rate stands out as the highest among all sectors, far exceeding the 2.6% increase in dividends from the entire S&P Composite 1500 index during this period.\n\nThe S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of tech companies with at least seven consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 13.27% in the past year. The index is down by 3.15% this year so far. It has reported a strong performance over the years. The index surpassed both the S&P Total Market Index (TMI) Information Technology and the S&P TMI in performance over one- and three-year periods between 2014 and 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. In addition to this, the index exhibited lower volatility than the S&P TMI Information Technology throughout one-, three-, and five-year periods within this timeframe. The report further elaborated that from December 2014 to December 2022, the index saw its dividends grow at an annual rate of 14.72%, compared with the 11.30% and 6.42% growth rates of the S&P TMI Information Technology and the S&P TMI Index, respectively. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best technology dividend aristocrats to consider, among others that are further discussed in this article.\n\nStory continues 10 Best Technology Dividend Aristocrats to Buy\n\nPhoto by Artem Beliaikin on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of technology and technology-related companies that have raised their dividend payouts for seven consecutive years or more. Since these stocks belong to the tech sector, their dividend yields tend to be lower comparatively. From the index, we picked 10 dividend stocks that have garnered the most attention from hedge fund investors by the conclusion of Q4 2023, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Badger Meter, Inc. (NYSE:BMI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 29\n\nBadger Meter, Inc. (NYSE:BMI) is an American company that provides water metering technology and flow solutions to its consumers.

        "content": "If you want to beat the market these days, you need to be investing in A-rated tech stocks. The technology sector, by far, has been the best stock market sector for the last several quarters, thanks to the advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nDespite a recent pullback, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is up more than 30% in the last 12 months, topping both the S&P 500 (22% gain) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (13% gain).\n\nA-rated tech stocks make ideal picks for growth investors because the sector is full of companies known for rapid growth and innovation. Tech companies are often on the ground floor of the most market-moving advances \u2014 like generative AI \u2014 that can revolutionize the world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs technology becomes a greater factor in today\u2019s world \u2014 playing a key role in banking, industry, energy, commerce, aerospace and manufacturing \u2014 tech companies can capitalize since they play an increasingly crucial role in everyday life.\n\nThe best way to find A-rated tech stocks is to use the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader is a free tool that ranks every stock on an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d scale based on earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy into some of the hottest stocks in recent months, these names are poised to deliver.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been my top choice in any list of A-rated tech stocks for a while now. And why not?\n\nThe chipmaker has as much as a 90% share in the high-powered graphics processing units that are most responsible for generative AI applications. And Nvidia has more up its sleeve \u2014 its GB200 Blackwell processor that\u2019s coming out later this year is estimated to be four times faster than the H100 GPU.\n\nNvidia had massive growth in 2023 with its stock price of 239%. While there are fears that Nvidia\u2019s growth may stall out in the beginning of this year as companies wait for the Blackwell processors, I think that the demand for generative AI is still going to power NVDA stock through the first half of the year.\n\nNVDA stock is up 61% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors in Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) have just as much reason to be bullish as their peers who hold NVDA stock. Palantir is up 164% over the last 12 months as the company\u2019s commercial division showed rapid growth.\n\nFor years, Palantir made its bread and butter by serving the intelligence and defense industries, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide real-time analysis to the Pentagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in the last quarter of 2023, Palantir saw 32% growth in its commercial segment, totaling $284 million in revenue. That compares to $324 million in government contract revenue in the quarter \u2014 but only 5% growth in that segment.\n\nI\u2019m expecting the commercial revenue to top the government revenue soon. Palantir\u2019s new Artificial Intelligence Platform works with both government and commercial clients. And Palantir also has a new agreement with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that will allow Palantir to use Oracle\u2019s cloud network to deploy products such as its Gotham and AIP platforms.\n\nIn all, I think that the recent pullback in PLTR stock makes for a great buying opportunity for a company that\u2019s only going to grow for the rest of 2024 \u2014 and possibly beyond.\n\nPLTR stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the first \u2014 and best \u2014 streaming companies. And it has proven to be able to adapt even in the face of massive competition to retain its position as king of the heap.\n\nNetflix showed a lot of vulnerability in 2022, with its share price dropping to below $200. Growth slowed and it appeared that other streaming services were finally starting to catch up and possibility surpass NFLX.\n\nBut then Netflix made what I think was a bold, and inspired business decision. It decided to toss away its longtime wink and nod to account sharing and instead charge a fee to any account holder who had someone outside of their household log in.\n\nRather than facing a backlash from the public, Netflix saw a massive windfall from the move for one reason \u2014 because people saw value in the product, and they didn\u2019t want to give it up. In the first quarter after the change, Netflix saw an increase of 8.8 million paid subscribers.\n\nFor the first quarter, NFLX saw revenue up 15% from a year ago to $9.37 billion. And it forecast Q2 revenue of $9.49 billion, which would be a nearly 16% increase from last year.\n\nNFLX is hitting on all cylinders. Again. The stock is up 14% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPDD Holdings (PPD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPPD Holdings (NASDAQ:PPD) is the parent company of the Chinese e-commerce company Pinduoduo, which specializes in serving China\u2019s mom-and-pop agricultural industry.\n\nPinduoduo makes it possible for small-scale farmers to sell their fruits and vegetables directly to consumers.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. PPD Holdings is expanding into Western markets via its Temu app, which provides Chinese goods that are sharply discounted. Temu is among the most downloaded apps in the U.S., German, the U.K., France, Canada and Italy.\n\nIn the U.S., Temu is the No. two shopping app, with monthly users increasing by 950% on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nEarnings in the fourth quarter included revenue of $12.5 billion, up 123% from a year ago. PDD brought in a profit of $3.1 billion and an increase of 146% from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s some risk involved with PDD. Increased tensions between the U.S. and Beijing increase the likelihood that companies like PDD could face additional restrictions from Washington. That\u2019s one reason why PDD stock is down 12% so far in 2024, despite its earnings growth and potential.\n\nPDD stock has an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader. But investing in this stock means paying attention to global politics.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe inclusion of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) proves that you can find exciting A-rated tech stocks even among the oldest and most established tech companies on the planet.\n\nIBM traces its history back for generations and punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s. IBM was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nToday, it\u2019s simply one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world. Its Watson AI engine and Watsonx generative AI platform have the potential to power IBM through the decade by partnering with enterprise customers.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of 2024 included revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Net income of $1.6 billion was a massive 69% increase from last year, and earnings per share of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM issued guidance for full-year revenue growth in the mid- single digits, and expects to generate roughly $12 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nIBM stock is up 12% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you love music, you probably know all about Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT). Spotify is a digital music, podcast and video service that provides countless tunes and audio files from hundreds of artists.\n\nThere are a few ways to make money. It sells advertisements that are targeted to its massive base of 388 million monthly active users. And it also has a premium ad-free subscription service that has 239 million monthly active users.\n\nBoth levels of users are growing rapidly. Spotify says the number monthly active users using Spotify for free increased 22% in the first quarter from a year ago, while paid premium memberships increased by 14% from a year ago.\n\nAnd that means much greater profits for SPOT stock. Spotify reported revenue of $3.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Profits of $1 billion were up 31% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThat\u2019s music to any investor\u2019s ears. SPOT stock is up 50% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs technology becomes more critical, more of our personal information and finances are online. Cloud computing makes it possible to tap into business networks at home, in the office or through a mobile device, but there are always bad actors who are looking to do damage by breaking into a network to steal or cause mayhem.\n\nSo my top pick for cybersecurity stock is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD). Its endpoint security solutions include its Falcon platform, which secures entry points on servers, smartphones and laptops.\n\nThe company offers 27 cloud modules on its Falcon platform on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, including corporate endpoint security, IT operations, cloud security, data protection, identity protection and cybersecurity generative AI.\n\nRoughly 64% of CrowdStrike customers subscribe to at least five modules, giving CrowdStrike an impressive revenue stream. The company brought in $845.3 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 33% from a year ago.\n\nCRWD stock should continue to perform as its customers base grows and its SaaS model flourishes. CrowdStrike is up 16% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, SPOT and CRWD.

        "title": "3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Quantum computing is poised to revolutionize various industries and greatly impact society due to its immense computational power. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers can perform complex calculations in minutes, which would take traditional supercomputers days or even years to accomplish.\n\nDespite the immense potential of quantum computing, the market value of most quantum computing stocks remains relatively low. This presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the technology\u2019s growth and reap substantial profits from quantum computing stocks you buy on the dip.\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen a slight dip in the Nasdaq over the past month, with the index falling 4.10%. This then could further the bull case even more.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three quantum computing stocks to buy on the dip for April this year. These companies are in the prime position to purchase and hold investments for patient investors.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is developing a comprehensive quantum computing ecosystem with its Q# framework. The company aims to make quantum computing accessible to developers through its platforms and tools.\n\nThe company has partnered with Quantinuum to enhance the reliability of its quantum systems. They have demonstrated a significant achievement by showcasing an 800x improvement in the logical error rate compared to the physical error rate.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft\u2019s Azure Quantum platform is central to its strategy, providing tools and resources that make quantum computing accessible to developers and researchers. This includes the Q# programming language and the Quantum Development Kit, which simplify the development of quantum algorithms. This is a key reason I think it\u2019s one of those quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nMany companies in the quantum industry are small speculative firms, while MSFT is perhaps as blue chip as they come in the technology sector. This then gives it a significant leg up over its competition for investors.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has long been a leader in quantum computing innovation, with significant investments in technology and partnerships aimed at advancing the practical applications of quantum computing.\n\nI also like IBM\u2019s positioning in the market for reasons similar to those of MSFT. It\u2019s another great blue chip name in the tech space and pays an impressive 3.61% dividend yield.\n\nLike MSFT, IBM continues to innovate in quantum software with Qiskit, a key tool for quantum computing programming. Qiskit 1.0, recently released, significantly improves circuit construction, compilation times and memory consumption.\r\n\r\nIBM\u2019s quantum roadmap for 2024 and beyond includes improving the quality and speed of quantum circuits and integrating higher-quality 100+ qubit Heron processors.\r\n\r\nI think that the long-term winners of the quantum computing arms race will be blue chip companies in one way or another. A disruptive startup will likely get acquired by one of those marquee names if it\u2019s perceived as either a threat or an opportunity. This then makes IBM and MSFT two serious contenders.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has been actively expanding into quantum computing, establishing a dedicated institute for research and development in this field.\n\nBaidu\u2019s quantum computer, Qian Shi, comes with a comprehensive hardware-software integration solution named Liang Xi, designed to simplify access to quantum resources across various platforms, including mobile and cloud environments. This system supports the creation of quantum algorithms.\n\nBaidu also recently announced donating its quantum computing research facility to the Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences (BAQIS). This move marks a shift in their strategy, positioning the company to potentially focus on other areas while still supporting quantum computing through collaborative efforts.\n\nBIDU\u2019s donation puts it out of the picture in terms of competition. Instead, it seems to have elevated its importance on a more national scale to China\u2019s interests. As one of the most prominent tech companies in the region, my thesis is that it will continue to be the main beneficiary of quantum technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The roadshow pitch from Rubrik (RBRK) ahead of its Thursday IPO: In the fast-paced world of AI, we can protect data \u2014 and eventually make a load of money doing it.\n\nSaid pitch worked.\n\nRubrik stock surged 17% to $37 by the close of a rocky day on Wall Street, a sizzling response to another AI ecosystem play, similar to the appetite for Reddit's (RDDT) newly issued shares just a few weeks earlier.\n\n\"We were preparing for this moment for several years, and the market was receptive,\" Rubrik co-founder, chairman, and CEO Bipul Sinha told Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\nShares of the cybersecurity firm were priced late Wednesday at $32, above the high-end of their expected range. The stock opened for trading at $38.60.\n\nThe upsized IPO hauled in $752 million for Rubrik's expansion plans, initially valuing the company at $5.6 billion.\n\nIt was just this January when Rubrik \u2014 which Microsoft (MSFT) has invested in since 2021 \u2014 raised a Series E round that valued the company at $3.3 billion. That round was led by Bain, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Greylock, and Khosla Ventures. The firm was valued at around $1.8 billion in a prior 2017 raise.\n\n\"The company is one to watch,\" an early Rubrik investor told Yahoo Finance. Bipul Sinha, CEO, Chairman & Co-Founder of Rubrik Inc., the Microsoft-backed cybersecurity software startup, rings the opening bell during his company\u2019s IPO at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 25, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA key part of Rubrik's selling point is its well-regarded tech exec, Sinha.\n\nThe former engineer has spent extensive time in the venture capital industry. As a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sinha put dollars behind names such as Nutanix (NTNX) and Pulse News. (Lightspeed is now a major shareholder in Rubrik, with about 24.9% of shares outstanding).\n\nHe has also held engineering positions at Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM).\n\nSinha founded Rubrik in 2014, working in coffee shops by the offices of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube in an effort to hire top developer talent.\n\nHe doesn't hide his modest upbringing, which has fueled his business building. \"Maximal thinking is how I lifted myself out of poverty,\" Sinha wrote in a letter in the company's IPO prospectus.\n\n\"He is the American Dream come true.\" Lightspeed Venture Partner's co-founder and partner Ravi Mhatre told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSinha said he remains as hungry as ever, despite the newfound attention around Rubrik and its future.\n\nWhile the cybersecurity market remains in growth mode, Rubrik does have to prove its worth to Wall Street. The company disclosed a loss of $354 million for the twelve months ending Jan. 31, 2024, despite subscription revenue rising 40% to $537.9 million. It posted a loss of $278 million for the twelve months ending Jan. 31, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company noted in its prospectus that it has had losses in each period since its inception.\n\n\"Profits are paramount,\" Sinha acknowledged, though he declined to share a precise timeline on when those profits would appear on the balance sheet.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "*\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft advance in extended hours after results\n\n*\n\nIBM drops after HashiCorp deal, disappointing Q1 revenue\n\n*\n\nCaterpillar falls on downbeat Q2 sales forecast\n\n*\n\nIndexes end down: Dow 0.98%, S&P 0.46%, Nasdaq 0.64%\n\n(Updates to 4:25 PM ET)\n\nBy Chibuike Oguh\n\nNEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected U.S. economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.\n\nData on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.\n\nDisappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11%, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.\n\nHowever, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8% in extended hours trading.\n\nEquities in the communications sector, dragged down by Meta, were the biggest losers in S&P 500. Other categories of stocks that lost ground are in healthcare, real estate, financials, consumer staples, and consumer discretionary sectors. \"The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 375.12 points, or 0.98%, to 38,085.80, the S&P 500 lost 23.21 points, or 0.46%, to 5,048.42 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 100.99 points, or 0.64%, to 15,611.76.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in just about 36 basis points of rate cuts from the Fed this year, down from about 150 bps seen at the start of the year, according to LSEG data.\n\nSeparately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labor market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.\n\n\"The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing,\" St. Aubin added.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Business Machines fell 8% after it announced a $6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.\n\nSouthwest Airlines slid nearly 7% as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time.\n\nCaterpillar shed 7% after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom.\n\nRising gold prices helped Newmont, the world's largest bullion miner, to report first quarter profit that beat estimates. Its shares gained 12%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.3-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 72 new highs and 85 new lows on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 1,410 stocks rose and 2,819 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and seven new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 203 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 10.7 billion shares, compared with the 11.07 billion average for the last 20 days.\n\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; additional reporting by Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 25, 2024 / As the green economy evolves, digital skills are becoming increasingly essential in green roles. IBM and The Burning Glass Institute unveiled new insights on how green and digital jobs increasingly overlap, creating demand for workers with digital skills in the green economy and for those who deploy core green skills across various sectors.\n\nAs technology continues to play a significant role in the green sector, workers must continue to develop their digital skills to remain competitive and contribute to the growth of sustainable practices. For example, forestry and environmental science technician roles increasingly require skills in coding and working with machinery using software for automation, replacing significant amounts of potentially dangerous and physically demanding manual tasks. Advances in AI also need energy efficiency and overall energy management skills.\n\nIBM SkillsBuild offers courses and credentials in sustainability and digital skills available for free to all learners.\n\nExplore IBM SkillsBuild sustainability offerings: https://skillsbuild.org/adult-learners/explore-learning/sustainability\n\nRead the full paper: https://ibm.biz/BdmscG\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

Those data points certainly would support that, but it's kind of early to say we're in that mode.\"\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft and Intel are scheduled to report their quarterly numbers on Thursday after markets close.\n\nYields across government bonds advanced, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising to multi-month highs. It was last standing at 4.7019%.\n\nSeparately, the number of Americans filing new claims for\n\nunemployment benefits\n\nunexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labor market conditions.\n\nThe data comes ahead of the Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in just about 36 basis points of rate cuts from the Fed this year, down from about 150 bps seen at the start of the year, according to LSEG data.\n\nAt 11:34 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 619.28 points, or 1.61%, at 37,841.64, the S&P 500 was down 65.74 points, or 1.30%, at 5,005.89, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 278.87 points, or 1.77%, at 15,433.88.\n\nCommunication services led losses across the major S&P 500 sectors with a 5% fall, on track for its biggest one-day decline since October.\n\nDownbeat results from other companies also weighed on equities, with International Business Machines shedding 9.2% after the firm said it will buy HashiCorp in a deal valued at $6.4 billion, and as its first-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthwest Airlines slid 8.4% after slashing its estimates for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time, saying it plans to undertake cost-cutting measures to ease the resultant blow.\n\nCaterpillar lost 7% after the company said it expects sales to fall in the second quarter as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom.\n\nOn the bright side, Newmont gained 10.2% after the world's largest gold miner beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.78-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.25-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 11 new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 16 new highs and 146 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

Disappointed by the revenue miss, IBM shares tumbled 8.3% in aftermarket hours.

Revenues grew 1% year over year to $14.50 billion and fell short of the consensus estimate of $14.57 billion. The weaker-than-expected revenues were attributable to the deceleration in the company's consulting business. Consulting revenues were flat in the quarter, while software revenues grew 5% from the year-ago levels.\r\n\r\nIBM reaffirmed its full-year guidance for mid-single-digit revenue growth for 2024.\n\nHashiCorp Deal\n\nIn a race to tap into the AI boom, IBM agreed to buy a cloud software company, HashiCorp HCP, for $35 per share in cash, or an enterprise value of $6.4 billion.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition will create a comprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era, as HashiCorp has a proven track record of enabling clients to manage the complexity of today\u2019s infrastructure and application sprawl. It will provide IBM access to HashiCorp\u2019s roster of some 4,400 clients and will drive significant synergies across multiple strategic growth areas like Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting.\r\n\r\nThe transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA in the first full year after completion and free cash flow in year two (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nFirst Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV)\r\n\r\nFirst Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund provides exposure to dividend payers within the technology and telecommunication sector by tracking the Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index.

AIOps automation and simulation: Clients can use AI-powered workload simulation to determine the best placement for workloads on the IBM Flash Grid.\n\nIn addition, IBM is announcing FlashSystem policy-based replication and high availability that is designed to provide easy-to-use, high-performance solutions for disaster recovery by enabling the system to automatically deploy and manage replication between two systems with minimal overhead, higher throughput, and lower latency. In the second half of 2024, IBM intends to further enhance these features to support highly available storage with replication to a third system, to simplify the tasks associated with configuring, managing, and monitoring replication.\n\nIBM FlashSystem provides enhanced data resilience\u00a0with the recently announced IBM FlashCore Module 4's cyber threat detection capabilities. All these capabilities will be available for the new IBM FlashSystem 5300 also unveiled today.\n\n\"We have IBM SAN Volume Controller sitting in front of all our storage, and IBM FlashSystem allows us to harness specific IBM functions. It's fast, reliable, secure, and easy to manage,\" said Kai Leibkuchler, Senior Manager of System & Network Engineering at Amadeus. \"I am excited to see the new enhancements in IBM FlashSystem 5300.\"\n\nBoth IBM's Storage Assurance program and the IBM FlashSystem 5300 are now generally available. IBM Storage Assurance supports the new FlashSystem 5300, as well as FlashSystem 7300 and FlashSystem 9500.

(Sipa US, Sipa US)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is due to report March quarter earnings after the close of US trading this Thursday, with its stake in AI and cloud computing market of particular interest to investors.\n\nIn its prior quarter, Microsoft announced that its AI capabilities contributed 6 percentage points of growth to the company\u2019s Azure revenue, up from 3% in the previous period, and analysts are looking for more.\n\nConsensus expectations among analysts tracked by FactSet are for revenue of $60.9bn (\u00a346.33bn), with a profit of $2.82 a share.\n\nIn the same period last year, Microsoft reported EPS of $2.45 on revenue of $52.86bn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn terms of business segments, Wall Street anticipates Microsoft will report productivity and business processes revenue of $19.54bn, intelligent cloud revenue of $26.25bn, and more personal computing revenue of $15.07bn.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nThe Google parent company is also reporting earnings after Thursday\u2019s closing bell, with analysts forecasting a rebound in ad spending.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet are expecting Alphabet to report earnings of $1.51 a share on revenue of $78.75bn.\n\nThe expected year-on-year growth in revenue is expected to be driven by improvements in Google advertising, led by Search and YouTube. Also, strong growth in subscriptions is expected to support its overall revenue.\n\nRead more: Barclays profits slip amid mortgage squeeze\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud services \u2013 a major growth driver \u2013 is expected to report a 25% increase in revenues for Q1 as the tech giant executes its artificial intelligence strategy.\n\nInvestors will be watching Alphabet\u2019s guidance and whether it is and can continue to execute on advances in AI strategy.\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nMiner Anglo American (AAL.L) which saw its shares soar after a buyout offer from BHP Group (BHP.L).\n\nThe stock climbed to a nine-month high after BHP said it made an offer to buy the London-listed miner, valuing its share capital at \u00a331.1bn. The deal would create the world\u2019s biggest copper miner with around 10% of global output.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe proposal is conditional on Anglo first splitting off its South African platinum and iron ore units, suggesting BHP is primarily interested in Anglo\u2019s copper resources.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The buyout offer from BHP, the world\u2019s largest publicly listed miner, for Anglo American, won\u2019t just shake up the mining industry, but will send a fresh chill through the City of London.\n\n\"There are concerns that if the deal goes through it could be the tip of the iceberg and more giants could leave the exchange.\n\n\"It comes hot on the heels of speculation that Shell might up sticks and leave for New York, rumours that Ocado may be considering leaving for the Big Apple, and follows the crushing disappointment of home-grown chip designer Arm choosing the Nasdaq over the FTSE 100.\"\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nIBM shares slipped as much as 8% in premarket trading after the hardware and software provider reported first-quarter revenue that was lower than analysts had predicted.\n\nIBM also announced it will buy HashiCorp in a deal valued at $6.4bn, in a move to expand its cloud-based software products and tap into the AI-powered boom.\n\nFirst-quarter sales gained 1% to $14.46bn, the Armonk, New York-based company said, below expectations of $14.55bn. This marks the company\u2019s third revenue miss in the last five quarters.\n\nIBM also reiterated its previous outlook of $12bn in free cash flow for the fiscal year ending in December.\n\n\u201cWe saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tighten discretionary spending,\u201d Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s finance chief, said.\n\nAstrazeneca (AZN.L)\n\nAstraZeneca shares are higher after the drugmaker reported quarterly revenue and profit above market estimates buoyed by resilient demand for its oncology and rare blood disorder drugs.\n\nOncology, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker's top business, delivered a 26% jump in first-quarter sales to $5.12bn.\n\nEarnings per share excluding some items rose 7% to $2.06 in the first quarter. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected $1.89 on average.\n\nNotable developments in the quarter included positive trial results for Imfinzi and Tagrisso in lung cancer, and several US and EU approvals for other drugs.\n\nAstraZeneca reiterated its full-year guidance of low double-digit to low teens percentage growth in both total revenues and EPS.\n\nThe group said the total dividend for the year will increase by $0.20 per share to $3.10.\n\nUnilever (ULVR.L)\n\nUnilever maintained its full-year guidance after a solid first quarter, which saw all five business divisions contributing to underlying sales growth.\n\nThe consumer goods giant, which owns Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum, grew underlying sales growth by 4.4% in the first quarter of the year.

        "content": "President Joe Biden is headed to New York state Thursday to visit a Micron (MU) semiconductor manufacturing plant, where he will hand out more federal money to support US chipmaking.\n\nSuch visits are one of the President\u2019s most common reasons for getting on the road. Biden has left Washington at least eight times as president to push his administration's chipmaking efforts.\n\nDuring these stops he often takes a tour to inspect the chips being built, as he did on a recent visit to an Intel facility in Arizona.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing, I\u2019ll be darned,\" he said of the tiny chips on display that day, according to a pool report.\n\nThis week\u2019s trip is to Micron's facilities near Syracuse, NY, where Biden will speak this afternoon.\n\n\"That\u2019s the President\u2019s home away from home,\" quipped Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York ahead of the trip, noting it was Biden\u2019s second visit to the same facility.\n\nThe purpose of Thursday\u2019s stop will be to tout a preliminary agreement for the government to send $6.14 billion to Micron in the years ahead, focused on the company\u2019s production of leading-edge memory chips both in New York and Idaho.\n\nLest Micron\u2019s Boise plant feel left out, that site got a visit from a Biden aide in 2022.\n\nOther big recent awards stemming from the 2022 CHIPs and Science act include $6.4 billion in grants for Samsung (005930.KS), $6.6 billion to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and $8.5 billion to Intel (INTC).\n\nBiden has visited them all.\n\nHe traveled all the way to Korea to visit a Samsung facility, two stops at Intel (INTC) factories, as well as a visit to TSMC\u2019s facilities in Arizona.\n\nTo top it off there was also a trip to see IBM\u2019s (IBM) chip operations in Poughkeepsie, NY, as well as a stop at communications company Viasat\u2019s headquarters for a speech on the intersection of semiconductors and veterans.\n\nChipmakers have also come to Biden, including Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's turn in the First Lady's box for the 2022 State of the Union address. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol visit the Samsung Electronics Pyeongtaek campus in 2022 in South Korea. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe politics of CHIPs visits\n\nLike everything in an election year, the trips are likely to inevitably be viewed through a politics lens even as it\u2019s unclear how many voters the Biden's administration's historic investments in the sector are likely to move.\n\nPolling on the 2022 law and its rollout has been sparse, though a 2022 survey from Morning Consult and Politico found 64% of respondents supportive of the idea of government assistance to spur the semiconductor sector.\n\nOnly 13% of respondents registered opposition to the idea, with the remainder unsure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs one might expect, Biden has spent a considerable amount of time in swing states for his chip trips, stopping in Arizona (twice) and Ohio to visit factories.\n\nBiden and his allies are also clearly banking on the economic effects being felt in these different communities (and credited to the President).\n\nThe government assistance is helping in \"writing a new chapter for places like Syracuse,\" Leader Schumer noted this week on a call with reporters.\n\nHe was followed by Lael Brainard, the director of Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, who made sure to note an \"economic comeback\" in the region after \u201cafter over 22,000 jobs disappeared from the Syracuse region under the prior administration.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s Micron announcement is the last of the Biden administration's awards for leading edge manufacturing with other, likely smaller, awards set to come in the months ahead on the semiconductor supply chain and related issues like advanced packaging.\n\nThe government grant for Micron will be paired with an investment from the company of up to $125 billion in projects that the government touts as the largest private investment in both New York and Idaho\u2019s history.\n\nThe White House says all of this activity will create over 70,000 jobs.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

A: (James J. Kavanaugh - Senior VP & CFO) Despite the revenue deceleration, IBM's consulting business continues to see strong demand, particularly in digital transformation, application modernization, and generative AI. The first quarter showed the strongest absolute signings, with a solid book-to-bill ratio. The revenue impact was partly due to the timing of Easter, affecting billing days, and a shift in backlog realization, particularly in Application Operations. IBM remains focused on capturing new client demand and driving economic multipliers across its hybrid cloud and AI platforms.\n\nQ: Given the tightened discretionary spending noted, how do you view the risk of this impacting the broader demand as the year progresses? A: (Arvind Krishna - CEO & Chairman of the Board) The global demand remains strong, similar to 2023, supported by various geographic strengths. Higher interest rates have increased the demand for technology solutions that enhance productivity and manage costs. IBM is focusing on areas like digital transformation to maintain growth in consulting. The company plans to pivot towards helping clients improve productivity and manage costs effectively, ensuring continued growth in consulting.\n\nQ: Can you provide more details on the synergies and financial impact of the HashiCorp acquisition, especially concerning cost synergies and its contribution to IBM's growth? A: (James J. Kavanaugh - Senior VP & CFO) The acquisition of HashiCorp is strategically aligned with IBM's hybrid cloud and AI ambitions, expected to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA in the first year and free cash flow by the end of the second year. Significant near-term cost synergies are anticipated, particularly in G&A efficiencies and global scaling. This acquisition is set to transform HashiCorp from a mid-single-digit free cash flow margin business to 30-40% in the coming years, enhancing IBM's overall growth profile.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: How does IBM define its AI book of business, and what is its growth trajectory, especially in the context of consulting and software revenue? A: (James J. Kavanaugh - Senior VP & CFO) IBM's AI book of business includes consulting signings and software subscriptions, SaaS, and perpetual licenses. The consulting segment of AI has doubled compared to last year, indicating robust demand and effective market penetration. This growth is part of IBM's broader strategy to integrate AI across its hybrid cloud platform, driving significant business transformation and productivity improvements for clients.\n\nQ: What is IBM's strategy to enhance the growth rate of its software business to align more closely with industry growth rates? A: (Arvind Krishna - CEO & Chairman of the Board) IBM is focused on transitioning from a flat growth trajectory to a more robust growth profile through organic innovation and strategic acquisitions. The company aims to consistently improve its software growth rate year-over-year, leveraging its strong portfolio and market incumbency to eventually exceed industry growth rates.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the enterprise pain points addressed by IBM's generative AI solutions and the typical client journey in adopting these technologies? A: (Arvind Krishna - CEO & Chairman of the Board) Enterprises are increasingly focusing on ROI and operational efficiencies when adopting generative AI. IBM assists clients in transforming their workforce and optimizing cost structures for AI implementations. The company advises focusing on scalable use cases that significantly impact productivity and customer experiences, ensuring substantial business outcomes from AI investments.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. dropped about 9% in extended trading after the company\u2019s weak consulting unit sales disappointed investors, overshadowing its acquisition of software firm HashiCorp Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden\u2019s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Tech Giants Hit in Late Hours After Meta\u2019s Outlook: Markets Wrap Biden\u2019s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Tesla Soars as Musk\u2019s Cheaper EVs Calm Fears Over Strategy\n\nFirst-quarter sales gained 1% to $14.5 billion, the Armonk, New York-based company said Wednesday in a statement. IBM also reiterated its previous outlook of $12 billion in free cash flow for the fiscal year ending in December.\n\nSeparately, IBM announced it has agreed to buy HashiCorp, which sells software that helps companies manage their cloud-computing operations, for an enterprise value of $6.4 billion. The acquisition is IBM\u2019s largest since buying software firm Red Hat in 2019 for $31.8 billion.\n\nThe deal is another move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna to turn the legacy tech hardware company into one focused on high-growth software and services. Big Blue has made other acquisitions in this area, such as Apptio for $4.6 billion last year, and divested managed infrastructure, weather and health businesses.\n\n\u201cHashiCorp has a proven track record of enabling clients to manage the complexity of today\u2019s infrastructure and application sprawl,\u201d Krishna said in the statement. \u201cCombining IBM\u2019s portfolio and expertise with HashiCorp\u2019s capabilities and talent will create a comprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era.\u201d\n\nThe shares declined to a low of $166.51 in extended trading after closing at $184.10 in New York. The stock has gained 13% this year, exceeding the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index rally of 6.2%.\n\nRead More: IBM Acquires Software Maker HashiCorp in $6.4 Billion Deal\n\nWith the HashiCorp acquisition, IBM will run the \u201cRed Hat playbook\u201d by pushing the product to its global catalog of customers, Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said in an interview. The deal will boost earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization within the first year, he added, and sees HashiCorp\u2019s free cash flow margin climbing to 30% to 40% as a part of IBM.\n\nIBM has eclipsed $1 billion in bookings for AI-focused products and consulting since mid-2023, Krishna said in the statement. That figure is roughly two-thirds consulting, and will mostly be recognized as revenue in 2025, Kavanaugh added.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have been focused on the potential for slippage in IBM\u2019s consulting division, which is its second largest business. That unit\u2019s revenue was $5.2 billion in the period ended March 31, unchanged from the quarter a year earlier.\n\nThe consulting results reflect a \u201cweak IT spending climate,\u201d wrote Anurag Rana, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Kavanaugh said that clients continue to tighten their spending owing to an uncertain economic environment.\n\nRed Hat posted sales growth of 9%, another comparatively slow period for a business that once regularly jumped more than 20% each quarter. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.68 a share.\n\nHashiCorp posted a sales gain of 22% to $583 million in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in January. The company has struggled recently due to a mix of sales execution and slowing cloud migrations, wrote Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair. \u201cAs part of IBM, HashiCorp could benefit from a more standardized sales approach and better ability to bundle tools to drive up the value of paid subscriptions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender Big Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Revenue: Reported at $14.5 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year, meeting the estimated $14.546 billion. Net Income: Reached $1.6 billion, surpassing the estimated $1.478 billion. Earnings Per Share (EPS): Achieved $1.69, exceeding the estimated $1.60 per share. Gross Profit Margin: Improved to 53.5%, up from 52.7% the previous year. Free Cash Flow: Increased by $0.6 billion to $1.9 billion. Software Revenue: Grew by 5% to $5.9 billion, driven by strong performance in hybrid platform and solutions. Strategic Acquisition: Announced intent to acquire HashiCorp, Inc. for $35 per share, enhancing hybrid cloud capabilities.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with IBM.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) disclosed its first-quarter earnings, revealing a performance closely aligned with market expectations. The detailed earnings can be explored in their recent 8-K filing. IBM reported a revenue of $14.5 billion, matching analyst estimates of $14.546 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.69, slightly above the forecasted $1.60. This performance underscores the company's robust strategy in hybrid cloud and AI sectors. IBM's Q1 Earnings: A Close Alignment with Analyst Projections Amid Strategic Moves\n\nIBM, a global leader in IT services and consulting, operates in 175 countries and serves 95% of all Fortune 500 companies. The company's significant influence is evident as it handles 90% of all credit card transactions worldwide and 50% of all wireless connections. IBM's strategic focus on hybrid cloud and AI innovations continues to drive its business forward, as reflected in the recent announcement of its intent to acquire HashiCorp, Inc., aiming to enhance its hybrid cloud platform capabilities.\n\nFinancial Highlights and Strategic Developments\n\nThe first quarter saw IBM achieving a slight revenue increase of 1% year-over-year, with significant contributions from its software segment, which grew by 5%. This growth is attributed to strong performance in hybrid platforms and solutions, particularly from Red Hat and Automation sectors. However, the infrastructure segment experienced a slight decline, emphasizing the shifting focus of IBM's business towards high-margin, high-growth areas.\n\nThe proposed acquisition of HashiCorp at $35 per share, totaling an enterprise value of $6.4 billion, marks a strategic expansion aimed at strengthening IBM's position in the hybrid cloud market. This acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.\n\nOperational Efficiency and Market Challenges\n\nIBM's operational efficiency is evident from its improved gross profit margin, which increased to 53.5% from 52.7% in the previous year. The company also reported a robust cash flow, with net cash from operating activities rising to $4.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion year-over-year. Such financial health enables IBM to invest in growth opportunities while returning value to shareholders through dividends, which amounted to $1.5 billion in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these positive outcomes, IBM faces challenges, including potential economic downturns and client budget constraints, which could impact its project-based business segments like consulting and infrastructure services. Moreover, the ongoing need to innovate in a competitive technology landscape requires continuous investment in R&D, which stood at $1.8 billion for the quarter.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nFor the full year 2024, IBM remains optimistic, expecting revenue growth in line with its mid-single digit model and projecting about $12 billion in free cash flow. This outlook is supported by IBM's strategic initiatives, including its acquisition plans and focus on high-growth areas like AI and cloud computing.\n\nIn conclusion, IBM's first-quarter results demonstrate a stable financial trajectory and strategic foresight in navigating the complexities of the global tech market. Investors and stakeholders might find reassurance in IBM's consistent performance and strategic acquisitions, positioning it well for future growth amidst evolving market demands.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from International Business Machines Corp for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "IBM (IBM) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.68 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.66%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this technology and consulting company would post earnings of $3.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.87, delivering a surprise of 2.38%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nIBM , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, posted revenues of $14.46 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $14.25 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nIBM shares have added about 11.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for IBM?\n\nWhile IBM has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for IBM: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.30 on $15.73 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $10.04 on $63.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Integrated Systems is currently in the bottom 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, ZoomInfo (ZI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 7.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nZoomInfo's revenues are expected to be $308.84 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "$6.4 billion acquisition adds suite of leading hybrid and multi-cloud lifecycle management products to help clients grappling with today's AI-driven application growth and complexity\n\nHashiCorp's capabilities to drive significant synergies across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting\n\nAs a part of IBM, HashiCorp is expected to accelerate innovation and enhance its go-to-market, growth and monetization initiatives\n\nTransaction expected to be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA within the first full year, post close, and free cash flow in year two\n\nARMONK, N.Y. and SAN FRANCISCO, April 24, 2024 /CNW/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and HashiCorp Inc. (NASDAQ: HCP), a leading multi-cloud infrastructure automation company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which IBM will acquire HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of $6.4 billion. HashiCorp's suite of products provides enterprises with extensive Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management capabilities to enable organizations to automate their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Today's announcement is a continuation of IBM's deep focus and investment in hybrid cloud and AI, the two most transformational technologies for clients today. IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\n\"Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure and applications across public and private clouds, as well as on-prem environments. The global excitement surrounding generative AI has exacerbated these challenges and CIOs and developers are up against dramatic complexity in their tech strategies,\" said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman and chief executive officer. \"HashiCorp has a proven track record of enabling clients to manage the complexity of today's infrastructure and application sprawl. Combining IBM's portfolio and expertise with HashiCorp's capabilities and talent will create a comprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era.\"\n\nThe rise of cloud-native workloads and associated applications is driving a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads enterprises are managing. In addition, generative AI deployment continues to grow alongside traditional workloads. As a result, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic, and complex infrastructure strategies. This represents a massive challenge for technology professionals.\n\nHashiCorp's capabilities enable enterprises to use automation to deliver lifecycle management for infrastructure and security, providing a system of record for the critical workflows needed for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp's Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure provisioning in these environments. HashiCorp's offerings help clients take a cloud-agnostic, and highly interoperable approach to multi-cloud management, and complement IBM's commitment to industry collaboration (including deep and expanding partnerships with hyperscale cloud service providers), developer communities, and open-source hybrid cloud and AI innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our strategy at its core is about enabling companies to innovate in the cloud, while providing a consistent approach to managing cloud at scale. The need for effective management and automation is critical with the rise of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud, which is being accelerated by today's AI revolution,\" said Armon Dadgar, HashiCorp co-founder and chief technology officer. \"I'm incredibly excited by today's news and to be joining IBM to accelerate HashiCorp's mission and expand access to our products to an even broader set of developers and enterprises.\"\n\n\"Today is an exciting day for our dedicated teams across the world as well as the developer communities we serve,\" said Dave McJannet, HashiCorp chief executive officer. \"IBM's leadership in hybrid cloud along with its rich history of innovation, make it the ideal home for HashiCorp as we enter the next phase of our growth journey. I'm proud of the work we've done as a standalone company, I am excited to be able to help our customers further, and I look forward to the future of HashiCorp as part of IBM.\"\n\nTransaction Rationale\n\nStrong Strategic Fit \u2013 The acquisition of HashiCorp by IBM creates a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform built for AI-driven complexity. The combination of each company's portfolio and talent will deliver clients extensive application, infrastructure and security lifecycle management capabilities Accelerates growth in key focus areas \u2013 Upon close, HashiCorp is expected to drive significant synergies for IBM, including across multiple strategic growth areas like Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible Automation Platform's configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. The two companies also anticipate an acceleration of HashiCorp's growth initiatives by leveraging IBM's world-class go-to-market strategy, scale, and reach, operating in more than 175 countries across the globe Expands Total Addressable Market (TAM) \u2013 The acquisition will create the opportunity to deliver more comprehensive hybrid and multi-cloud offerings to enterprise clients. HashiCorp's offerings, combined with IBM and Red Hat, will give clients a platform to automate the deployment and orchestration of workloads across evolving infrastructure including hyperscale cloud service providers, private clouds and on-prem environments. This will enhance IBM's ability to address the total cloud opportunity, which according to IDC had a TAM of $1.1 trillion in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate in the high teens through 2027.1 Attractive Financial Opportunity \u2013 The transaction will accelerate IBM's growth profile over time driven by go-to-market and product synergies. This growth combined with operating efficiencies, is expected to achieve substantial near-term margin expansion for the acquired business. It is anticipated that the transaction will be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA within the first full year, post close, and free cash flow in year two.\n\nHashiCorp boasts a roster of more than 4,400 clients, including Bloomberg, Comcast, Deutsche Bank, GitHub, J.P Morgan Chase, Starbucks and Vodafone. HashiCorp's offerings have widescale adoption in the developer community and are used by 85% of the Fortune 500. Their community products across infrastructure and security were downloaded more than 500 million times in HashiCorp's FY2024 and include:\n\nTerraform \u2013 provides organizations with a single workflow to provision their cloud, private datacenter, and SaaS infrastructure and continuously manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle Vault \u2013 provides organizations with identity-based security to automatically authenticate and authorize access to secrets and other sensitive data Additional products \u2013 Boundary for secure remote access; Consul for service-based networking; Nomad for workload orchestration; Packer for building and managing images as code; and Waypoint internal developer platform\n\nTransaction Details\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, IBM will acquire HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash, or $6.4 billion enterprise value, net of cash. HashiCorp will be acquired with available cash on hand.\n\nThe boards of directors of IBM and HashiCorp have both approved the transaction. The acquisition is subject to approval by HashiCorp shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nThe Company's largest shareholders and investors, who collectively hold approximately 43% of the voting power of\u00a0HashiCorp's outstanding common stock, entered into a voting agreement with IBM pursuant to which each has agreed to vote all of their common shares in favor of the transaction and against any alternative transactions.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024.\n\n____________________\r\n1 The total cloud opportunity is the sum of the cloud-directed spends across Hardware, IT services and SW for Private and Public cloud implementation, sourced from IDC's Worldwide Black Book Live Edition, March 2024 (V1 2024)\n\nConference Call Details\n\nIBM's regular quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. ET, today. The Webcast may be accessed here. Presentation charts will be available shortly before the Webcast.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

In a broader context, IBM\u2019s acquisition strategy highlights its long-term vision to develop a robust and resilient cloud portfolio catering to the diverse needs of businesses across sectors. Looking ahead, IBM is expected to pursue strategic buyouts and foster innovation to strengthen its position as a leading provider of hybrid cloud solutions.\r\n\r\nThe stock has gained 45.6% in the past year compared with the industry's growth of 35.2%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nIBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.\r\n\r\nPinterest PINS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 37.42%.

Rising sea levels and flooding threaten coastal megacities like New York City and Jakarta, and extreme heat waves, like those that afflict cities across South Asia and the Middle East each year, are projected to become more frequent and severe.\n\nWhile our built environments and infrastructure are being tested by unpredictable weather and changing populations, many urban communities are facing heightened climate-related health and economic risks.

        "content": "ROME (AP) \u2014 Tech giant Cisco Systems on Wednesday joined Microsoft and IBM in signing onto a Vatican-sponsored pledge to ensure artificial intelligence is developed and used ethically and to benefit the common good.\n\nCisco Systems chief executive Chuck Robbins signed the document, known as the Rome Call, and met privately with Pope Francis, the Vatican said.\n\nThe pledge outlines key pillars of ethical and responsible use of AI. It emphasizes that AI systems must be designed, used and regulated to serve and protect the dignity of all human beings, without discrimination, and their environments. It highlights principles of transparency, inclusion, responsibility, impartiality and security as necessary to guide all AI developments.\n\nThe document was unveiled and signed at a Vatican conference on Feb. 28, 2020 \u2014 just before Italy locked down as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 by Microsoft\u2019s Brad Smith and IBM\u2019s John Kelly III. Universities, U.N. agencies, private corporations and nongovernmental organizations have signed on as well.\n\nFrancis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, devoting his annual peace message this year to the topic.\n\nArchbishop Vincenzo Paglia, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life who is leading the AI initiative, welcomed Cisco\u2019s participation. He cited the IT company\u2019s expertise in \u201cinfrastructure, security and protection of AI data and systems.\u201d\n\nArtificial intelligence has captured world attention thanks to advances by cutting-edge systems like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that have dazzled users with the ability to produce human-like text, photos and songs. But the technology has also raised fears about the risks the rapidly developing technology poses to jobs, privacy and copyright protection and even human life itself.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInternational Business Machines to hold its Annual General Meeting on 30th of April CEO Arvind Krishna's total compensation includes salary of US$1.50m The total compensation is 37% higher than the average for the industry Over the past three years, International Business Machines' EPS grew by 23%  and over the past three years, the total shareholder return was 54%\n\nUnder the guidance of CEO Arvind Krishna, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has performed reasonably well recently. This is something shareholders will keep in mind as they cast their votes on company resolutions such as executive remuneration in the upcoming AGM on 30th of April. However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.\n\nSee our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nComparing International Business Machines Corporation's CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nAt the time of writing, our data shows that International Business Machines Corporation has a market capitalization of US$167b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$20m for the year to December 2023. That's a notable increase of 23% on last year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$1.5m.\n\nFor comparison, other companies in the American IT industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$15m. Hence, we can conclude that Arvind Krishna is remunerated higher than the industry median. Moreover, Arvind Krishna also holds US$70m worth of International Business Machines stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$1.5m US$1.5m 7% Other US$19m US$15m 93% Total Compensation US$20m US$17m 100%\n\nTalking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 31% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 69% of the pie. It's interesting to note that International Business Machines allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance. ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at International Business Machines Corporation's Growth Numbers\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 23% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 2.2% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nShareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. It's also good to see modest revenue growth, suggesting the underlying business is healthy. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..\n\nHas International Business Machines Corporation Been A Good Investment?\n\nMost shareholders would probably be pleased with International Business Machines Corporation for providing a total return of 54% over three years. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.\n\nTo Conclude...\n\nGiven that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. However, any decision to raise CEO pay might be met with some objections from the shareholders given that the CEO is already paid higher than the industry average.\n\nWhile it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. We've identified 2 warning signs for International Business Machines that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.\n\nSwitching gears from International Business Machines, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this freelist of high return, low debt companies is a great place to look.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire software company HashiCorp Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Tesla Stock in \u2018No Man\u2019s Land\u2019 After 43% Rout Ahead of Earnings Biden\u2019s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Ray Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing\n\nIBM and HashiCorp could reach an agreement as soon as Wednesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.\n\nHashiCorp shares, which jumped as much as 28% Tuesday, closed up 19% to $29.15 for the biggest one-day gain in more than two years, giving the San Francisco-based company a market value of $5.8 billion. That reversed a 10% decline over the past 12 months through Monday\u2019s close.\n\nBloomberg News reported in March that HashiCorp had been considering a sale. A final agreement hasn\u2019t been reached and talks could still end without one, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for IBM and HashiCorp declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday that IBM and HashiCorp were in talks.\n\nHashiCorp\u2019s software helps companies in a range of industries set up their digital infrastructure in the cloud, which can lower costs and speed up the time it takes them to bring products to market.\n\nA deal for HashiCorp would strengthen IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud focus and \u201cappears to be a good strategic fit,\u201d wrote Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Anurag Rana. \u201cHashiCorp helps organizations shift their workloads to a public cloud from on-premise, and will likely complement IBM\u2019s open-source products sold by Red Hat.\u201d\n\nIBM\u2019s multi-cloud approach makes it the most-logical buyer of HashiCorp, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish wrote in March, adding that IBM historically used the software company\u2019s products.\n\nShares in Armonk, New York-based IBM have risen 45% over the past 12 months and were little changed Tuesday, giving the company a market value of about $167 billion. IBM is set to release first quarter earnings for 2024 on Wednesday.\n\nIBM\u2019s largest acquisition to date remains its $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in 2019. That software business has become a point of investor anxiety in recent quarters, as its growth has slowed to single digits, comparatively sluggish for a unit that once regularly jumped more than 20% each quarter.\n\nIn the past year, IBM has announced more than 10 acquisitions, including its $4.6 billion takeover of software company Apptio and purchase of data-integration platforms StreamSets and WebMethods for \u20ac2.13 billion ($2.3 billion).\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Dinesh Nair, Katie Roof and Fareed Sahloul.\n\n(Updates with closing share price in third paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets Big Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Skip the Robotaxi\u2014Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Andrea Sarudi, from IBM Corporate Environmental Affairs, worked with IBMers to implement 50 pollinator gardens at IBM locations globally from 2021 to 2023. One such garden involved replacing grass with flower beds in Bogota, Colombia's capital. This and other pollinator projects required different strategies according to each location and they help not only bees but also flies, moths, butterflies, wasps, beetles, hummingbirds and even bats and small mammals.\n\nBy the end of 2023, IBM established 70 pollinator gardens across 26 countries, surpassing the goal of 50.\n\nLearn more about IBM's commitment to creating, enhancing, and restoring habitats to support biodiversity in the 2023 Impact Report\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24, after the closing bell. The company is expected to have registered higher revenues from the consulting segment, backed by rising demand for technology consulting services across various industries.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nThe Consulting segment comprises Business Transformation, Technology Consulting and Application Operations. It provides consulting and application management services that offer value and innovation to clients by leveraging industry, technology and business strategy, and process know-how.\r\n\r\nIBM Consulting is working to modernize contact center operations by harnessing generative AI. The solution also makes it easier to switch between chatbots and live agents. The detailed summary enables agents to speed up resolution and improve customer experience. Moreover, IBM Consulting has incorporated AWS generative AI services into IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerator to expedite the enterprise's cloud transformation process.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, IBM collaborated with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry. The collaboration is likely to facilitate higher productivity and help accelerate business transformation in consumer-packaged goods and retail firms. Leveraging indigenous IBM technologies such as IBM Garage methodology, the company aims to help business enterprises undergo rapid digital transformation by embracing generative AI. The IBM Garage approach enables firms to manage strategic initiatives, quantify business outcomes and advance organizational and cultural change through bold IT transformations, re-imagined customer and employee experiences and automated business processes.\r\n\r\nIBM is further likely to help the clients complement SAP solutions with IBM watsonx. The collaboration will help wholesale distributors and retailers improve product distribution by feeding external data such as weather, traffic and local events into the SAP Direct Distribution solution and apply AI to identify optimal store delivery routes to reduce costs. It will also help to efficiently manage store-level assortments by using generative AI based on the market dynamics of each store, prior sales patterns, anticipated demand and current product mix. These are likely to have driven incremental revenues in the Consulting segment in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring the March quarter, IBM also collaborated with Riyadh Air to enhance travel experiences, harnessing the power of IBM Consulting's expertise in AI, technology and operations. The state-of-the-art project aims to leverage cutting-edge digital technologies to incorporate easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access AI-powered systems and expand the scope of in-flight.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration aims to incorporate the IBM Garage model to help accelerate Riyadh Air\u2019s digital transformation and innovation efforts. The model is designed to bring together cross-functional teams, leverage agile methodologies and use cutting-edge technologies to accelerate innovation and generate tangible business outcomes. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the Consulting segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall Expectations\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Consulting revenues is pegged at $5,340 million, indicating growth from $4,962 million in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for revenues from Consulting is pegged at $5,175 million, implying 4.3% growth year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $14,577 million. It generated revenues of $14,252 million in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.60 per share, indicating growth from $1.36 in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for IBM for the first quarter.

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24, after the closing bell. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is likely to have recorded higher revenues from the Software segment backed by growing demand for its advanced AI-driven solutions and product innovation.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nThe Software segment includes Hybrid Platform & Solutions comprising software services, Red Hat, automation and data & artificial intelligence (AI) businesses and Transaction Processing.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter, IBM introduced LinuxONE 4 Express, an advanced data center solution designed to provide cybersecurity, scalability and AI inferencing for hybrid cloud environments. The solution\u2019s cutting-edge features make it suitable for a multitude of use cases for startups and small and medium-sized enterprises.\r\n\r\nWith built-in hardware-based security technology and confidential computing capabilities, the solution effectively shields sensitive data and digital assets. It enhances protection against both external threats and insider breaches by enabling scalable isolation for individual workloads, while consolidation of databases into a LinuxONE system significantly lowers costs and streamlines IT environments. The seamless integration enables data analysis to be conducted exactly where the data is located. These are likely to have supported the top line in the Software segment.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter, IBM integrated the open-source Mixtral-8x7B large language model into its watsonx AI and data platform. The optimized version of Mixtral-8x7B, developed by Mistral AI, showcases impressive performance gains. Internal tests reveal a remarkable 50% increase in throughput compared to the standard model. By leveraging quantization techniques to reduce the model size and memory requirements, IBM anticipates significant reductions in latency, potentially ranging from 35% to 75%, depending on batch size.\r\n\r\nMixtral-8x7B's incorporation underscores IBM's dedication to cutting-edge AI research and development. Built on innovative Sparse modeling and the Mixture-of-Experts technique, this model excels in rapid data processing and contextual analysis. Its ability to efficiently handle vast datasets makes it a valuable asset for businesses seeking actionable insights. All these are likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.\n\nOverall Expectations\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Software revenues is pegged at $5,998 million, indicating marginal growth from $5,921 million in the year-ago quarter. However, our estimate for revenues from Software is pegged at $6,140 million, suggesting a 3.7% improvement year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $14,577 million.

        "content": "In a market cycle where the spotlight shines on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies among other growth-centric concepts, targeting dividend stocks is inherently a conservative venture. Turns out, that might be the most prudent plan given the circumstances.\n\nFundamentally, geopolitical concerns have unsettled Wall Street. Tensions in the Middle East have resulted in two nations attacking each other. Fears now focus on global oil supplies and potential disruptions. That\u2019s not including what\u2019s happening in Europe and a potential regional response to the armed conflict.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, a hot jobs market and soaring energy prices have resulted in stubbornly elevated inflation. And that means the Federal Reserve might delay interest rate cuts or perhaps even hike them. It\u2019s an awkward situation, to say the least. Below are reliable dividend stocks to help you sleep easier at night.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food stalwart McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) makes a strong case for trustworthy dividend stocks thanks to filling everyday needs. Yes, technically speaking, the Golden Arches aligns with the broader discretionary retail space. However, in our hectic world, people rarely have time to always cook at home. Sometimes, you need a quick bite to eat or to treat yourself to junk food on your \u201ccheat\u201d days.\n\nFor passive income, McDonald\u2019s offers a forward yield of 2.46%. What\u2019s notable here is that the company commands a track record of 48 years of consecutive dividend increases. Further, the payout ratio is reasonable at 49.48%. Thus, it\u2019s one of the dividend stocks that will help investors get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking earnings per share of $12.40 on revenue of $26.86 billion. That\u2019s a solid improvement over last year\u2019s results of $11.94 EPS on sales of $25.49 billion. Combined with a moderate buy rating and a consensus price target of $323.30, MCD presents a great choice amid the troubles.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother strong player for dividend stocks to buy, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells itself under the circumstances. As a manufacturer of various home and personal care products, P&G is a boring enterprise. However, boring tends to mean permanently relevant. What helps the company is generational awareness. Consumers may have a tendency of buying products with which they are most familiar.\n\nLet\u2019s talk passive income. Right now, P&G offers a forward yield of 2.55%. It\u2019s not the most generous yield but it runs above the consumer staple sector\u2019s average of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio isn\u2019t bad at 57.94%. However, the kicker for me is the track record. With 68 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, it\u2019s a dividend king.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS to reach $6.45. That\u2019s a sizable move from last year\u2019s result of $5.90. Also, revenue could land at $84.7 billion, up 3.3% from last year\u2019s print of $82.01 billion. Further, fiscal 2025\u2019s top line could rise to $87.88 billion.\n\nAnalysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $169.60 price target.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA big-box retailer, Target (NYSE:TGT) may face pressure amid the broader economic anxieties. However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Of course, Target has the benefit of scooping up transactions from everyone because it\u2019s not a membership-only store.\n\nRight now, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 2.61%. Again, it\u2019s not outstandingly high. However, it does beat the underlying consumer staples sector. What\u2019s noteworthy is that the payout ratio is quite low at 41.77%. This provides confidence for yield sustainability. Also, the company enjoys a track record of 53 years of payout increases.\n\nFor the current fiscal year (2025), circumstances are a bit tricky, Experts anticipate EPS to hit $9.40, above last year\u2019s result of $8.94. That\u2019s the good news. However, forecasted revenue is only $107.19 billion, slightly below parity against fiscal 2024\u2019s print.\n\nStill, the following year could see sales rise to $111.18 billion. Notably, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $183.62 average price target.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a candidate for boring dividend stocks, it might not get more boring than Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM). That said, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that IRM was one of the few securities that moved higher during Friday\u2019s downturn. Fundamentally, that may be due to the underlying business. Iron Mountain specializes in holistic document and asset security \u2013 both the physical and digital kinds.\n\nAt a time of great uncertainty and nefarious activity, Iron Mountain looks awfully intriguing. It also happens to be one of the top dividend stocks, offering a forward yield of 3.46%. Now, the payout ratio is very elevated, no doubt. However, keep in mind that IRM is structured as a real estate investment trust. REITs tend to run hotter-than-average payout ratios.\n\nAnother enticing factor is that experts are optimistic about the financials. For fiscal 2024, they\u2019re targeting EPS of $1.96, above last year\u2019s print of $1.82. On the top line, sales could land at $6.09 billion. That\u2019s up 11.1% from 2023\u2019s haul of $5.48 billion. That\u2019s not bad for a boring entity.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nLet\u2019s keep the boring theme going with IBM (NYSE:IBM). A legacy tech giant, IBM has long lagged its innovation peers. However, it started to gain positive momentum in recent sessions. Since the start of the year, shares have gained more than 12% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, they\u2019ve enjoyed a nearly 44% boost.\n\nWhat I like about the company known as \u201cBig Blue\u201d is that it\u2019s an unheralded player in artificial intelligence. While many other enterprises get the AI spotlight, IBM has been working diligently on machine learning and other innovations. Oh yeah \u2013 it also pays a forward yield of 3.66%. Further, the company enjoys 28 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like a one-off situation either. Experts anticipate EPS to reach $10.08, a solid improvement over last year\u2019s print of $9.62. As for the top line, they\u2019re seeking revenue of $63.61 billion, up 2.8% from 2023\u2019s haul of $61.86 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s boring but it\u2019s relevant \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes it one of the dividend stocks to buy.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother enterprise structured as a REIT, Prologis (NYSE:PLD) bills itself as the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. As of the end of last year, the company owned or had investments in ventures, properties and development projects that span approximately 1.2 billion square feet. Its facilities cover a diverse base of approximately 6,700 customers.\n\nBecause of its status as a large REIT, Prologis doesn\u2019t disappoint in the passive income department. It offers a forward yield of 3.71%. Now, the payout ratio is high. However, REITs again often run this metric to what would otherwise be considered nosebleed levels. Also, the company enjoys 11 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate EPS to land at $2.47. Admittedly, that\u2019s lower than last year\u2019s result of $3.29. However, they\u2019re also projecting sales of $7.74 billion, up 13.5% from last year\u2019s tally of $6.82 billion. Next year, revenue may rise to $8.47 billion.\n\nPrologis also enjoys a consensus strong buy view with a $146.29 average price target. Thus, it\u2019s one of the dividend stocks with significant growth potential.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019ll end this list of dividend stocks with another REIT, Realty Income (NYSE:O). Arguably the most popular REIT, Realty offers tremendous fundamental relevance. Its properties cover multiple consumer needs such as convenience stores, pharmacies and home improvement retailers, among other categories. Unless you anticipate such businesses going out of business, O stock should be a reasonably safe wager.\n\nOf course, beyond the relevance, Realty truly comes alive thanks to its passive income. Presently, it features a forward yield of 5.81%. Also, the company enjoys a track record of 32 years of consecutive dividend increases. Significantly, Realty pays out on a monthly basis, thus aligning with the schedule of everyday life.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts believe EPS could hit $1.53. That\u2019s a big boost from last year\u2019s print of $1.26. On the top line, they\u2019re looking for sales of $4.94 billion, up 21% from last year\u2019s haul of $4.08 billion. And the following year could bring revenue of $5.33 billion.\n\nRealty carries a moderate buy rating with a $58.75 average price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 22, 2024 / IBM\r\nOriginally published in the IBM 2023 Impact Report\n\nWael El Chouwani, IBM Sustainability Software Market leader, believes that leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to support sustainable building operations is of utmost importance. This not only aligns with our commitment to sustainability but also showcases the transformative potential of technology in creating smarter cities, including objectives in sustainability. In 2023, IBM put this into practice with clients such as The King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD).\n\nCreated with sustainability in mind, IBM and KAFD worked together on one of the world's largest real estate projects to achieve LEED Platinum certification for green neighborhood development, the highest accreditation from the U.S. Green Building Council. And Wael was part of this project.\n\nThrough our collaboration with KAFD, using AI capabilities, IBMers helped achieve sustainable building operations by enabling advanced data analysis and leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential energy-saving opportunities. Thanks to the integration of AI tools, the KADF can optimize energy usage, reduce environmental impact, and enhance overall operational efficiency.\n\nThe seamless integration of AI capabilities empowers the KAFD to achieve its sustainability goals, making it a leading example of how technology can power sustainable buildings.\n\nLearn more about how IBM is using AI to power sustainable buildings in the 2023 Impact Report\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks Most at Risk of AI\u2019s Alarming Energy Consumption",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a Bitcoin (USD-BTC) moment and the situation could rapidly deteriorate for some of the biggest companies in this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nBitcoin miners are energy intensive. Their thousands of computers generate excess heat that must be cooled and dissipated. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates miners consume as much as 2.3% of all electricity produced in the U.S. It threatened to cause the segment to crash because of the rising costs. AI is in a similar situation but it could mushroom exponentially very fast.\n\nIn 2021, before the real explosion of AI, the EIA said data centers, one of the biggest AI users, were consuming about 2% of all the electricity produced. It noted they are \u201cone of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd AI is an energy hog. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that data centers\u2019 total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2026, or \u201croughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. alone, Boston Consulting Group estimates AI-powered data centers will consume as much as 7.5% of electric output by 2030, triple what it was in 2022.\n\nThe energy crisis is real because there is not enough capacity available to meet projected demand. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest data center operators for its cloud services business. CEO Andy Jassy told Fortune, \u201cThese large language models are so power hungry, and there\u2019s just not enough energy right now.\u201d The e-commerce giant recently purchased a nuclear-powered data center to help offset its electricity demands.\n\nAmazon operates 125 data centers globally but just 24 in the U.S. Below are three other giant data center operators at risk because of AI\u2019s alarming energy consumption.\n\nEquinix (EQIX) corporate building with Equinix (EQIX) logo on it\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nEquinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates 260 data centers in 71 major metropolitan areas around the globe. It understands the all-consuming nature of artificial intelligence in data centers. Equinix has been using AI-based software to reduce by 9% energy consumption at a Frankfurt data center and plans to roll it out to its other Frankfurt data centers. It was an essential response as Germany introduced an aggressive new law to increase energy efficiency.\n\nIf it wants to fulfill its expansion dreams, Equinix will need to deploy similar strategies elsewhere. The REIT wants to build out its xScale data centers for hyperscale usage. Hyperscalers are supersized cloud services providers like Amazon and Alphabet\u2018s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. These are the biggest drivers of AI demand as they seek out AI accelerators to boost their capacity. Google says its AI accounts for almost 15% of its data centers\u2019 energy usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithout money-saving initiatives like this, Equinix could find itself pinched by growing demand of its xScale facilities.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it\u2019s understood Microsoft\u2018s (NASDAQ:MSFT) need for data centers for its fast-growing Azure cloud service, what might not be as apparent is just how many the tech giant owns and operates itself.\n\nAccording to industry site Dgtl Infra, Microsoft operates 300 physical data centers in 64 regions globally. It is in the process of adding 15 more regions to its constellation, with each region having from one to three individual data centers. Together, Microsoft\u2019s data centers span over 75 million square feet.\n\nMicrosoft needs this web of connectivity as it is one of the most prominent companies diving head-first into AI. Beyond the scalability AI provides Azure, the tech stock has integrated it throughout all of its products and services, including Bing, Microsoft 365, Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, LinkedIn, Skype, Xbox and Outlook.\n\nBecause every facet of Microsoft\u2019s business is tied to AI, the power demands it places on the grid are excessive. It also hints at the next pain point for AI: water consumption, an equally scarce resource. Google\u2019s data centers used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 while Microsoft\u2019s water usage soared 34%.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is the world\u2019s largest data center REIT with 308 locations in 25 countries. As companies continue to transition their data to the cloud, they increasingly turn to DLR to house it. Among its biggest customers are Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and hyperscaler Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAs much of the problem as AI is, Digital Realty sees it also being part of the solution. DLR says AI can measure and reduce consumption significantly by intuitively deploying resources at appropriate times. In a 2019 pilot program using its Apollo AI platform, DLR tested conservation methods at two European facilities. It rolled it out to 14 more soon after. Combined, Digital Realty was able to save about 18 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of savings.\n\nThe REIT offers hope that even as AI drives immense demand on energy resources, it can offset that by increasing efficiency. But whether that is possible on a global scale as AI usage increases exponentially remains to be seen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0the 10 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024.\n\nAmerican politicians using their insider knowledge and influence to make money off the stock market has piqued the curiosity of researchers and average investors for decades.\u00a0 Despite huge controversies and calls for an increased scrutiny and a ban on stock trading for politicians, American senators and Congress members continue to trade stocks. A report by Unusual Whales talked in detail about the performance of American politicians' stock picks in 2023. The report said that of the 100 Congress members trading stocks last year, 33% beat the S&P 500.\n\nWhich Stocks American Congress Members Like?\n\nThe report also showed that the most popular stocks among American politicians last year from healthcare, financials and technology industries. The portfolios of Democrats performed better than those of Republicans since the latter group was heavy on financials, oil, and commodities.\n\nCongress Stock Picks Performance and Returns: An Independent Analysis\n\nIt's not only the mainstream financial publications and news outlets that closely watch American politicians' stock trades. Investing enthusiasts equipped with data analysis skills also take a huge interest in analyzing the benefits of following Congress stock trades over the long term. For example, three years ago, someone on Reddit analyzed data available on a website called Senate Stock Watcher and processed over 9,000 stock trades initiated by the members of US Congress to see how these stocks perform. This Redditor crunched numbers and found returns of stocks for a month, a quarter and since 2019 through the date of their analysis. The idea was to see how Congress stock picks performed in the short term and long term. Results shows that Congress members are long-term investors since their stock picks beat the S&P 500 by about 6%. However, even for short-term time windows, Congress members' stock picks beat the market albeit with narrow margins.\n\nWhile the STOCK act signed into law by former President Barack Obama significantly limited insider trading by Congress members, data shows that US politicians and insiders sprang back into action when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\u00a0 A research showed that between February and early April of 2020, 12 senators made 227 stock purchases worth about $98 million, while 37 House members did 1,358 trades worth as much as $60 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Wall Street Journal's analysis shows that about 240 officials of health agencies that won federal contracts related to the pandemic had owned shares of biotech and drug companies worth between $9 million to $28 billion. Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024\n\nPerformance of Republicans and Democrats in Stock Trading\n\nInvestors who are interested in tracking American politicians' stock picks and their performance can use Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF (BATS:KRUZ) and Unusual Whales Democratic ETF (BATS:NANC). Both ETFs were launched in early 2023. NANC invests in stocks purchased or sold by Democratic members of Congress and their spouses, while KRUZ invests in stocks traded by Republicans. So far in 2024, KRUZ is up 4.14%, while the ETF has returned about 17% in the past one year. Democrats performed well in both these time periods since the NANC ETF gained 6.3% year to date and 27% over the past one year.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we used publicly available datasets analyzing stock trades of American politicians and picked 10 stocks that were bought by American senators and Congress members over the past few weeks. Some top names in the list include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Devon Energy Corp (NYSE:DVN). With each stock we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to what insiders are doing? \u00a0Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. Dassault Systemes SE (OTC:DASTY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nFrench software company Dassault Systemes\u00a0SE (OTC:DASTY)\u00a0is one of the stocks American congressmen are piling into in 2024. Congressman Josh Gottheimer from New Jersey bought shares worth between $1,001 - $15,000 in Dassault Systemes\u00a0SE (OTC:DASTY)\u00a0on March 13. Since then the stock is down 11%.\n\n9. Humacyte Inc (NASDAQ:HUMA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nBiotechnology company Humacyte Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:HUMA)\u00a0is one of the stocks American politicians are buying. Tommy Tuberville, a senator US senator from Alabama, bought Humacyte Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:HUMA)\u00a0shares worth somewhere between $1,000 to $15,000 on March 21. Since then through April 17, the stock is down about 15%.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 12 funds reported owning stakes in Humacyte Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:HUMA)\u00a0as of the end of 2023.\n\nDuring the company's Q4 earnings call, Humacyte's management talked in detail about business updates:\n\n\"We had cash and cash equivalents of $80.4 million as of December 31, 2023. We also completed two transactions in early 2024, which added substantially to our cash balances. On March 5, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering of common stock and raised net proceeds of approximately $43.1 million. In addition, on March 11, 2024, we\u2019ve received $20 million in proceeds from an additional draw under our revenue purchase agreement with Oberland Capital. Total net cash used was $69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents are adequate to finance operations well past the currently anticipated timelines for FDA approval and commercialization of the HAV in the vascular trauma indication.\n\nThere was no revenue for the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, and there were no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and was related to a grant supporting the development of the HAV that was completed during 2022. Research and development expenses were $20.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and were $76.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 2023 increases resulted primarily from increased personnel, external services expenses and materials expenses supporting the expanded research and development initiatives in our clinical studies, including the completion of our V005 Phase II/III trial, NRB017-Ukraine humanitarian trial for use of HAV and extremity vascular trauma as well as our BLA filing in December and the clinical development of the HAV for use in dialysis access.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nIn addition to Humacyte, insiders are also buying Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Devon Energy Corp (NYSE:DVN).\n\n8. Ardmore Shipping Corp (NYSE:ASC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 16\n\nSeaborne transportation company Ardmore Shipping Corp\u00a0(NYSE:ASC)\u00a0is one of the stocks American congress members are piling into. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx from North Carolina on March 4 bought Ardmore Shipping Corp\u00a0(NYSE:ASC)\u00a0shares in a transaction worth between $1,000 and $15,000. Since March 4 through April 17 Ardmore shares have gained about 2.2%.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 16 hedge funds reported having stakes in Ardmore Shipping Corp\u00a0(NYSE:ASC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Ardmore Shipping Corp\u00a0(NYSE:ASC)\u00a0was Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates which owns an $11 million stake in Ardmore Shipping Corp\u00a0(NYSE:ASC).\n\nIn addition to ASC, American politicians are also piling into Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Devon Energy Corp (NYSE:DVN).\n\n7. Dominion Energy Inc (NYSE:D)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nThomas Richard Carper, an American Senator from Delaware, bought Dominion Energy\u00a0Inc (NYSE:D)\u00a0shares worth between $1,001 - $15,000 on March 28. Since then through April 17, Dominion Energy\u00a0Inc (NYSE:D)\u00a0stock has declined by about 4%.\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 26 hedge funds had stakes in Dominion Energy\u00a0Inc (NYSE:D). The biggest stakeholder of Dominion Energy\u00a0Inc (NYSE:D)\u00a0during this period was Ric Dillon's Diamond Hill Capital which owns a stake worth about $185 million in Dominion Energy\u00a0Inc (NYSE:D).\n\nIn February, during an earnings call, the company talked about guidance and important business updates:\n\n\"We\u2019ve provided a reconciliation of actual operating earnings relative to the guidance we provided on the last earnings call. There were 3 key drivers for the variance to guidance. First, during the fourth quarter, we experienced $0.02 of worse-than-normal weather in our utility service territories. Second, we incurred $0.03 of hurt related to certain outages at Millstone.\n\nThird, as part of the business review and after we had given earnings guidance in November, we elected to change our accounting methodology for the way we recognize investment tax credits and earnings. This resulted in a $0.02 quarterly and $0.07 annual negative variance to guidance. I\u2019ll expand more on this accounting methodology change in a moment. A summary of all drivers for earnings relative to the prior year period is included in Schedule 4 of the earnings release kit. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we view 2023 as a transition year for the company due to the pending results of actions we\u2019ve taken as part of the business review to support our long-term objectives. With that in mind, let me refresh our housekeeping around 2023 results.\n\nIn 2023, our operating earnings per share were $1.99. Similar to last quarter, we believe it warrants highlighting many of the same adjustments that investors may consider to more accurately assess 2023 results. First, we experienced historically mild weather during 2023, representing $0.18 of full year earnings headwinds, including $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Recall that the second quarter was the mildest quarter relative to 15-year normal in the last 50 years. We don\u2019t expect weather to deviate from historical normal in this manner going forward. Second, we continue to expect approximately $0.50 of annualized interest savings from parent-level debt repayment, driven by the sales of Cove Point and the gas utilities. Remember, the way discontinued operations is reflected in our 2023 results, 100% of the earnings from these assets are removed but the benefit from use of sale proceeds is not captured.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nIBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) ranks sixth in our list of the stocks American politicians are buying in 2024. Lloyd Doggett, the Congressman from the Democratic Party, bought IBM Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:IBM)\u00a0shares on March 11 in a transaction worth 1,001 and $15,000. Since then the stock has declined about 4.3%.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 50 hedge funds reported having stakes in IBM Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:IBM).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOther bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and\u00a0International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM\u2019s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 10 Stocks to Watch Insiders Are Buying These 11 Penny Stocks,\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Stocks American Politicians are Buying in 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Will IBM Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?",
        "content": "Technology powerhouse International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) used to be an industry giant. Big Blue's market cap peaked at $239 billion in the summer of 1999, sparking speculation about perhaps forming the world's first trillion-dollar company.\n\nBut the dot-com bubble popped, and IBM changed gears. The market cap reached $230 billion again in 2012, ending an era where other tech giants were copying IBM's one-stop IT shop business model.\n\nBut that year also marked a sharp strategy shift under newly appointed CEO Ginni Rometty. IBM stiff-armed the hardware side of its operations, apart from the unique mainframe systems segment. When Rometty handed off the reins to current CEO Arvind Krishna in the spring of 2020, IBM was refocused on hybrid cloud computing, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAnd its market cap had dropped to just $106 billion.\n\nThe company has enjoyed another renaissance since then, joining the AI boom just a bit later than many peers. Currently perched at a total market value of $167 billion, is the reformed Big Blue finally destined for trillion-dollar greatness before the end of this decade?\n\nLet's set some realistic targets for IBM\n\nA starting point of $167 billion is pretty impressive. Only 45 of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's household names can boast a larger market cap than IBM's today.\n\nOne-trillion is still a long way away, though. I'm talking about a sixfold jump, and share prices would rise even faster thanks to IBM's unstoppable habit of buying back shares by the boatload.\n\nSo if IBM has a chance of reaching $1 trillion at all, it won't be a quick and easy romp.\n\nThat's a sixfold gain in five years and change. Most stocks wouldn't even dream of it. And honestly, IBM faces some long odds here. Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) have posted the strongest gains on the stock market over the last five years.\n\nSupermicro soared on the wings of unique AI systems; Celsius was a literal penny stock five years ago, and its health-conscious energy drink had no distribution system or marketing to speak of. It's a lot easier to multiply those modest starting values than it is to list IBM from a $167 billion platform.\n\nAnd even then, Celsius barely reached the sixfold market cap multiplication target. Supermicro only made it halfway. CELH Market Cap Chart\n\nWhy I don't mind IBM missing the trillion-dollar mark\n\nSo the trillion-dollar goal looks nearly unreachable from IBM's current starting point, given only five or six years of AI-driven growth. That's alright. I still think IBM is one of the best AI buys in today's market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company can pull its weight with much milder price gains. It doesn't have to meet some arbitrary market-cap goal in five years. Remember, only one stock actually achieved a similar gain over the last five-year period, and that was from an optimal starting point. IBM isn't reinventing energy drinks here or on the verge of signing a global distribution deal with PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). That's what it took to lift Celsius Holdings' stock sixfold in half a decade.\n\nBut the company is nibbling on explosive growth opportunities in the massive market for business-grade AI services. Its Watson AI engine and the related Watsonx generative AI platform were built for enterprise customers, and the long-term contracts are starting to drop in.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Blue's stock trades at just 22 times earnings and 12 times free cash flows. That's a bargain-basement deal next to AI-driven market darlings like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Supermicro. IBM's stock could triple and still look affordable next to these recent Wall Street rockets.\n\nSo yes, IBM offers a tempting blend of low share prices and exciting growth opportunity in the AI market. You should look away from that hard-to-reach trillion-dollar goal and embrace IBM for what it is -- an undervalued tech titan. You should pick up a few low-priced IBM shares while you can before the market really catches on to the company's valuable position in the enterprise AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The ghosts of \u2018Wintel\u2019: What leaders can learn from the diverging paths that made Microsoft a $3 trillion powerhouse and flatlined Intel",
        "content": "Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t accustomed to hearing \u201cno.\u201d But that was the answer from Paul Otellini, CEO of Intel.\n\nIt was 2006, and Intel, the global king of computer chips, was bringing in record revenue and profits by dominating the kinds of chips in hottest demand\u2014for personal computers and data centers. Now Jobs wanted Intel to make a different type of chip for a product that didn\u2019t even exist, which would be called the iPhone.\n\nOtellini knew chips for phones and tablets were the next big thing, but Intel had to devote substantial capital and its best minds to the fabulously profitable business it already possessed. Besides, \u201cno one knew what the iPhone would do,\u201d he told The Atlantic seven years later, just before he stepped down as CEO. \u201cThere was a chip that they were interested in, that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more, and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nOtellini, who died in 2017, was a highly successful CEO by many measures. But if that decision had gone the other way, Intel might have become a chip titan of the post-PC era.\u00a0 Instead, it gave up on phone chips in 2016 after losing billions trying to become a significant player. As he left the company, Otellini seemed to grasp the magnitude of his decision: \u201cThe world would have been a lot different if we\u2019d done it.\u201d UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 07: The IBM Personal Computer System was introduced to the market in early 1981, at a time when IBM was the world's largest mainframe computer manufacturer. Such was IBM's reputation that 200,000 of the PCs were sold in the first year. As a result it set a standard by which every other computer company was to be measured. The microcomputer market had grown from its beginnings in the kit building hobby market to a potential billion-dollar industry. The IBM PC used the Intel 8088 microprocessor, a factor which was also pivotal to Intel's growing success. The machine used magnetic tape to load data, and featured an optional floppy disk drive. The hard drive did not make an appearance until the release of IBM's XT machine in 1983. (Photo by SSPL/Getty Images)\n\nMeantime, some 800 miles north, in Seattle, Microsoft was struggling to find its role in a tech world dominated by the internet, mobile devices, social media, and search. Investors were not impressed by its efforts. No one could have foreseen that years later, a few key decisions would set the company up as an AI powerhouse and send its stock soaring.\n\nThere was a time not so long ago that Microsoft and Intel were both atop the tech world. They were neither competitors nor significant customers of each other, but what New York University\u2019s Adam Brandenburger and Yale\u2019s Barry Nalebuff deemed \u201ccomplementors.\u201d Microsoft built its hugely profitable Windows operating system over the years to work on computers that used Intel\u2019s chips, and Intel designed new chips to run Windows (hence \u201cWintel\u201d). The system fueled the leading tech product of the 1990s, the personal computer. Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates became a celebrity wonk billionaire, and Intel CEO Andy Grove was Time\u2019s 1997 Man of the Year.\n\nSince then their paths have diverged sharply. Microsoft in 2000 was the world\u2019s most valuable company, and after losing that distinction for many years, it\u2019s No. 1 again. Intel was the world\u2019s sixth most valuable company in 2000 and the largest maker of semiconductors; today it\u2019s No. 69 by value and No. 2 in semiconductors by revenue, far behind No. 1 TSMC (and in some years also behind Samsung).\n\nStory continues Chart shows Microsoft and Intel stock prices since 1990\n\nA Fortune 500 CEO makes thousands of decisions in a career, a few of which will turn out to be momentous. What\u2019s easy to explain in hindsight\u2014that Microsoft would be at the forefront of AI, that Google would become a behemoth, that Blockbuster would fade into obscurity\u2014is never preordained. Often the fateful decisions are identifiable only in retrospect. Nothing more vividly illustrates this than the parallel stories of Microsoft and Intel. The case study of what went right and wrong at those two giant corporations offers a master class in business strategy not just for today\u2019s front-runners at the likes of Google, Open AI, Amazon, and elsewhere\u2014but also for any Fortune 500 leader hoping to survive and thrive in the coming decade.\n\nWintel\u2019s origin story\n\nThe two companies were founded a mere seven years apart.\u00a0Intel\u2019s founders in 1968 included Robert Noyce, coinventor of the computer chip, and Gordon Moore, who had written the seminal article observing that the number of transistors on a chip doubled every year, which he later revised to two years\u2014Moore\u2019s law, as others later called it. Andy Grove was employee No. 3. All three are still regarded as giants of the industry.\n\nBill Gates famously dropped out of Harvard to cofound Microsoft with Paul Allen, a childhood friend. They were excited by the prospects of creating software for a new concept, the personal computer, also called a microcomputer. They launched Microsoft in 1975. Gates cover: July 21, 1986 Grove cover: February 17, 1997 Joba and Gates cover: August 26, 1991\n\nThe two companies\u2019 paths crossed when IBM decided in 1980 to produce a PC and wanted to move fast by using existing chips and an existing operating system developed by others. It chose Intel\u2019s chips and Microsoft\u2019s operating system, profoundly transforming both companies and the people who ran them. IBM\u2019s size and prestige made its design the industry standard, so that virtually all PCs, regardless of manufacturer, used the same Intel chips and Microsoft operating system for decades thereafter. As PCs swept America and the world, Intel and Microsoft became symbols of technology triumphant, glamour, success, and the historic bull market of 1982 to 2000.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\nThe reign of Gates and Grove peters out\n\nIn October, 2000, Fortune ran an article with an illustration depicting Gates and Grove as monumental Egyptian sphinxes. The headline: \u201cTheir Reign Is Over.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning: \u201cGates and Grove attained hegemony by exploiting a couple of key choke points in computer architecture\u2014the operating system and the PC microprocessor,\u201d the article explained. \u201cBut in the new, more diverse IT world wired together by universal internet protocols, there are no such obvious choke points to commandeer.\u201d\n\nThus began a multiyear identity crisis for both companies. Intel\u2019s PC chips and Microsoft\u2019s PC operating system and applications remained bountifully profitable businesses, but both companies and their investors knew those were not the future. So what was? And who would lead this new era?\n\nIn January of 2000, Gates stepped down as CEO after 25 years, and Steve Ballmer, Microsoft\u2019s president and a college friend of Gates, took his place; Gates remained chairman. Two days later, Microsoft\u2019s stock rocket ran out of fuel. On that day the company\u2019s market value hit $619 billion, a level it would not reach again for almost 18 years.\n\nGrove was no longer Intel\u2019s CEO in 2000, having handed the job to Craig Barrett, a longtime company executive, in 1998. But as Intel\u2019s visionary and most successful CEO, Grove remained an important presence as chairman of the board. His health was becoming an issue; he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995, and in 2000 he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Intel\u2019s stock roared until August, when the company\u2019s market value peaked at $500 billion. It has never reached that level since.\n\nBut most significantly, 2000 was the year that the internet began to seem like it just might make Wintel irrelevant.\n\nAt Intel, Barrett responded with acquisitions, many of which were in telecommunications and wireless technology. In concept, that made great sense. Cell phones were going mainstream, and they required new kinds of chips. \u201cCraig tried to very aggressively diversify Intel by acquiring his way into new businesses,\u201d says David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor who was on Intel\u2019s board of directors at the time. \u201cI would say that was not his skill set, and 100% of those acquisitions failed. We spent $12 billion, and the return was zero or negative.\u201d\n\nIn the lean years after the dotcom balloon popped, Barrett continued to invest billions in new chip factories, known as fabs, and in new production technologies, so Intel would be well positioned when demand rebounded. That is a hint to one of the most important lessons of the Wintel saga and beyond: Protecting the incumbent business, even in a time of transition, is almost impossible to resist. That course usually sounds reasonable, but it holds the danger of starving the company\u2019s future. As the great management writer Peter Drucker said: \u201cIf leaders are unable to slough off yesterday, to abandon yesterday, they simply will not be able to create tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u2018We screwed it up\u2019\n\nAt Microsoft in the 2000s, \u201cit was not at all obvious what would happen with the shape and volume of PCs, with operating system margins, or the future of applications like Word or Excel,\u201d says Ray Ozzie, a top-level Microsoft executive from 2005 to 2010. \u201cThere was significant internal debate at Microsoft and in the industry on whether, in the future, the PC was dead, or if it would continue to grow and thrive.\u201d Maybe Word, Excel, and those other applications that resided on your hard drive would move to the internet, like Google Docs, introduced in early 2006. In that case Microsoft would need a new business model. Should it develop one? Some executives thought so. But no one knew for sure.\n\nDuring this period, Microsoft was hardly a model of corporate innovation, and succumbed to what often happens when successful companies are disrupted. Ozzie explains: \u201cWhen you are rolling in resources and there are multiple existential threats, the most natural action to protect the business is to create parallel efforts. It\u2019s more difficult to make a hard opinionated choice and go all in. Unfortunately, by creating parallel efforts, you create silos and internal conflict, which can be dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nAs competing teams fought for primacy, Microsoft missed the two most supremely profitable businesses since the PC era: search and cell phones. Those misses were not fatal because Microsoft still had two reliable, highly profitable businesses: the Windows operating system and the Office suite of apps. But in Drucker\u2019s terms, those were yesterday businesses. Investors didn\u2019t see substantial tomorrow businesses, which is why the stock price went essentially nowhere for years. Missing search and cell phones didn\u2019t threaten Microsoft\u2019s existence, but it threatened Microsoft\u2019s relevance and importance in a changing world, which could eventually damage the company\u2019s appeal among investors and the world\u2019s best employees. The reasons for those crucial misses are instructive.\n\nIn 2000 Google was an insignificant internet search startup with no clear business model, but it had an inkling that selling advertising could be profitable. We know how that turned out: Google\u2019s 2023 ad revenue was $238 billion. The model was entirely foreign to Microsoft, which made tons of money by creating software and selling it at high prices. Charging users nothing? Selling ads? Microsoft had never run a business at all like Google\u2019s. By the time Google\u2019s model had proved itself, Microsoft was hopelessly far behind. Today its Bing search engine has a 3% market share across all platforms worldwide, says the StatCounter web-traffic analysis firm. Google\u2019s share is 92%. Google founders Sergey Brin, left and Larry Page , right, are shown at the companies headquarters in Mountaint View, Calif., Thursday March 13, 2003. The maker of world's most popular Internet search engine is widely expected to make its stock market debut during the first half of 2004, creating a level of excitement rarely seen since the dot-com gold rush turned Silicon Valley into the mother lode of IPO ecstasy and agony. (Richard Koci Hernandez/San Jose Mercury News) (Photo by MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s failure in cell phones was, in a large sense, similar\u2014the company didn\u2019t fully grasp the structure of the business until it was too late. The company assumed the cell phone industry would develop much like the PC industry, in which sellers like Dell combined Intel\u2019s chips and Microsoft\u2019s software in a final product. But Apple\u2019s starkly different iPhone business model, in which it designs its own chips and writes its own software, was an enormous hit. The other big winner in the industry, Google\u2019s Android smartphone operating system, likewise ignored the PC model. Instead of selling its operating system, Google gives it away to phone makers like Samsung and Motorola. Google makes money by putting its search engine on every phone and by charging app makers a fee when users buy apps.\n\nBill Gates acknowledges that Microsoft\u2019s miss in cell phones was life-changing for the company. Looking back on his career in 2020, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest mistake I made in terms of something that was clearly within our skill set.\u201d\n\nIntel also lost the mammoth cell phone opportunity, and in a similar way. It couldn\u2019t adapt. Intel understood the opportunity and was supplying chips for the highly popular BlackBerry phone in the early 2000s. The trouble was, Intel hadn\u2019t designed the chips. They were designed by Arm, a British firm that designs chips but doesn\u2019t manufacture them. Arm had developed a chip architecture that used less power than other chips, a critical feature in a cell phone. Intel was manufacturing the chips and paying a royalty to Arm.

(Photo By Liz Hafalia/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n\nUnderstandably, Intel preferred to make phone chips with its own architecture, known as x86. Paul Otellini decided to stop making Arm chips and to create an x86 chip for cell phones\u2014in retrospect, \u201ca major strategic error,\u201d says Yoffie. \u201cThe plan was that we would have a competitive product within a year, and we ended up not having a competitive product within a decade,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we missed it. It was that we screwed it up.\u201d\n\nGroping for a megatrend\n\nJust as 2000 was a turning point for Intel and Microsoft, so was 2013. Broadly they were in the same fix: still raking in money from the businesses that made them great; getting into the next big opportunities too late or unsuccessfully; groping for a megatrend they could dominate. Their stock prices had more or less flatlined for at least a decade. Then, in May 2013, Paul Otellini stepped down as Intel\u2019s CEO. In August, Steve Ballmer announced he would step down as Microsoft\u2019s CEO.\n\nSuccession is the board of directors\u2019 No. 1 job, more important than all its other jobs combined. The stakes are always high. How the Intel and Microsoft boards handled their successions, nine months apart, largely explains why the two companies\u2019 storylines have diverged so dramatically.\n\nUnder Otellini\u2019s successor, Brian Krzanich, Intel kept missing new-chip deadlines\u2014ironically failing to keep up with Moore\u2019s law even as competitors did so\u2014and lost market share. The company gave up on smartphone chips. After five years as CEO, Krzanich resigned abruptly when an investigation found he had had a consensual relationship with an employee. CFO Bob Swan stepped in as CEO, and the production troubles continued until, by 2021, for the first time in Intel\u2019s existence, its chips were two generations behind competitors\u2019. Those competitors were Taiwan\u2019s TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung.\n\nIn crisis mode, Intel\u2019s board brought back Pat Gelsinger, an engineer who had spent 30 years at Intel before leaving for 11 years to be a high-level executive at EMC and then CEO of VMware. As Intel\u2019s CEO he has announced an extraordinarily ambitious and expensive plan to reclaim the company\u2019s stature as the world leader in chip technology.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s board spent almost six months finding Ballmer\u2019s successor under worldwide scrutiny. At least 17 candidates were publicly speculated upon. British and Las Vegas bookies offered odds on the eventual winner; Satya Nadella, who recently marked 10 years as CEO, was a 14-to-1 long shot.\n\nNadella has arguably been the best corporate succession choice, regardless of\u00a0industry, in years or perhaps decades. Under his leadership the stock finally broke out of its 14-year trading range and shot upward, rising over 1,000%. Microsoft again became the world\u2019s most valuable company, recently worth $3.1 trillion. Gelsinger, with just over three years in the job, can\u2019t be fully evaluated; industry experts wonder if he\u2019ll be Intel\u2019s Nadella. But both CEOs offer useful examples of how to move a company from the past to the future.\n\nNadella orchestrated Microsoft\u2019s dramatic turnaround by taking an outsider\u2019s look at the company and making big changes with little drama. He began by making Office apps (Word, Excel) compatible with Apple iPhones and iPads\u2014heresy at Microsoft, which regarded Apple as an archenemy. But Nadella realized the two companies competed very little, and why not let millions more people rely on Office apps? The move sent a message to the company and the world: The Microsoft culture\u2019s endemic arrogance would be dialed down considerably. Interoperating with other companies could now be okay.\n\nThat was largely a new business model at the company, with many more to follow. For example, Nadella bought LinkedIn, a player in social media, which Microsoft had entirely missed, and later bought GitHub, a repository of open-source code, which Microsoft had previously despised. Both deals and several others have been standout successes.\n\nMore broadly, Nadella brought a new leadership style for a new environment. In a company known for vicious infighting that could paralyze action, he settled long-running debates over major projects. For example, in 2016 he sold the Nokia cell phone business that Microsoft had bought a year before he became CEO, acknowledging that the company had lost the battle for phones. \u201cPeople don\u2019t quite grok why things have blossomed under Satya,\u201d says a former executive. \u201cHis superpower is to make a choice, eliminate conflict, and let the business blossom.\u201d\n\nAt Intel, Gelsinger also introduced culture-defying changes. The company had risen to dominance by designing leading-edge chips and manufacturing them with industry-leading skill. Amid that intense pride, the idea of creating a separate foundry business\u2014manufacturing chips designed by others\u2014was anathema. Yet under Gelsinger, Intel has created a new foundry business while also relying more on other foundries, including TSMC, the world\u2019s largest chipmaker,\u00a0for some of its own chips\u2014a double shock to the culture.\n\nGetting a long-established company with a titanium-strength culture to adopt seemingly strange business models as Nadella and Gelsinger did can be painfully hard. Often only a new CEO can bring the openness necessary to make it happen. The same problem arises when a company needs to update its corporate strategy. Microsoft had been seeking and debating the next big thing for years, but Nadella saw that the company didn\u2019t need to find a potentially huge new future-facing business. It already had one: Azure, its cloud computing service. Amazon Web Services was and is the industry leader, but Azure has grown to a strong No. 2 because Nadella has given it abundant capital and some of the company\u2019s brightest workers. He also made an unorthodox investment in OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, commiting $13 billion to the company starting before it was famous. Now Azure offers its customers OpenAI technology. In Drucker\u2019s terms, it\u2019s a big, thriving tomorrow business.\n\nGelsinger changed Intel\u2019s strategy even more radically. He bet heavily and successfully on billions of dollars from the U.S. government. Via the CHIPS and Science Act, Intel could receive up to $44 billion in aid for new U.S. chip factories the company is building in coming years. \u201cAs I like to joke, no one has spent more shoe leather on the CHIPS Act than yours truly,\u201d he tells Fortune. \u201cI saw an awful lot of senators, House members, caucuses in the different states. It\u2019s a lot to bring it across the line.\u201d\n\nA key insight is that for a major company with a history of success, like Microsoft and Intel, moving beyond an outmoded strategy and fully embracing a new one is traumatically difficult and sometimes impossible. For years both companies tried and failed to do it. A related insight: Doing it is easier for Nadella and Gelsinger because they have the advantage of being \u201cinsider outsiders,\u201d leaders with deep knowledge of their organization but without heavy investment in its strategy; Nadella was working on Azure, not the Windows operating system or Office apps, long before he became CEO, and Gelsinger\u2019s 11-year absence from Intel gave him license to rethink everything.\n\nA larger lesson is that, in the stories of these two great companies, succession is the most important factor. Considering that Microsoft on the whole has fared better than Intel over the past 24 years, it\u2019s significant that over that period, Microsoft has had only two CEOs and Intel has had five. Most people study the CEO when explaining a company\u2019s performance, but they should first examine those who choose the CEO, the board of directors.\n\nLooking back at these stories, asking \u201cwhat if\u201d is irresistible. What if Paul Otellini had said yes to Steve Jobs? What if any of Intel\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s CEOs had been someone else? What if Intel, under a different CEO, had developed a successful GPU, the kind of chip that powers today\u2019s AI engines (it tried)\u2014would you ever have heard of Nvidia? Bill Gates said in 2019, \u201cWe missed being the dominant mobile operating system by a very tiny amount.\u201d What if that tiny amount had shifted slightly? Whose phone would you be using today?\n\nIt\u2019s all endlessly tantalizing but of course unknowable. The value of looking back and asking \u201cwhat if,\u201d is to remind us that every day leaders are creating the future\u2014and neglecting their duty if they don\u2019t learn from the past.\n\n5 lessons from the Wintel case study:\n\n1.Success can be a company\u2019s worst enemy. The great management writer Peter Drucker said every company must \u201cabandon yesterday\u201d before it can \u201ccreate tomorrow.\u201d But in a successful company, every incentive pushes leaders to protect yesterday. Intel and Microsoft struggled for years to create their tomorrows.\n\n2. Leaders must be open to business models that seem strange. Whether giving away software or manufacturing chips designed by others as a separate business, both Microsoft and Intel faced competitors doing things differently.\n\n3. Get everyone on the same page. Debate is healthy up to a point, but at Microsoft it continued far too long until Nadella became CEO and set clear priorities. At Intel a series of CEOs backed differing solutions to its declining business, which prolonged a muddled strategy.\n\n4. Succession is the board\u2019s No. 1 job, more important than all its other jobs combined. Everyone knows it, but some boards still do their job poorly. If they make a mistake, none of the other lessons matter. Considering that Microsoft has come through the past 24 years better than Intel, it may be significant that Microsoft has had only two CEOs in that period while Intel has had five.\n\n5. Failure isn\u2019t fatal. The Wintel story is a pointed reminder that all companies, including the best, suffer failures and fall into crises. There are no exceptions. The leaders of any company, even the grandest, must always be ready to engage the skills of organizational rescue, and know that even that can be part of greatness.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider IBM (IBM). This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nThis technology and consulting company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.08%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, IBM was expected to post earnings of $3.78 per share, but it reported $3.87 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.38%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.12 per share, while it actually produced $2.20 per share, a surprise of 3.77%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for IBM lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nIBM currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 24, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Originally published in the IBM 2023 Impact Report\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 19, 2024 / For many decades, IBM has developed products with consideration for serviceability and upgradability, and for the reuse, recyclability, and recoverability of materials within them. For this, IBM supports hardware refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling. Linda Demmler, GM of IBM Global Asset Recovery Services, leads the team that identifies ongoing opportunities to redeploy IBM Z, IBM Power, IBM Storage and other IT devices to avoid waste.\n\nIn 2023, IBM reused equipment that clients returned to IBM when they upgraded their infrastructure with new IBM systems. IBM used this returned equipment to refresh its own internal fleet of servers and storage. Linda and her team initiated a series of projects to replace equipment, such as replacing Z13 with Z15 servers. These projects repurposed servers that ultimately avoided waste and supported IBM's results of reselling, reusing or recycling 96.8% of end-of-life products.\n\nBy utilizing IBM's Certified Pre-Owned equipment in this project, the team was able to deploy cost effective cloud-based resources to support development teams, which enabled them to have capacity that matched the timing of application support requirements.\n\nLearn more about how IBM is reusing IBM Z\u00ae and IBM Power\u00ae to avoid waste in the 2023 Impact Report\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Stay Ahead of the Game With IBM (IBM) Q1 Earnings: Wall Street's Insights on Key Metrics",
        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that IBM (IBM) will announce quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 17.7% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $14.52 billion, increasing 1.9% from the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.7% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some IBM metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenue- Global financing' will reach $190.94 million. The estimate suggests a change of -2.6% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Consulting' at $5.22 billion.

        "title": "Will Modest Top-Line Improvement Buoy IBM Earnings in Q1?",
        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the integrated systems provider beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents.\r\n\r\nThe New York-based company is expected to have recorded a top-line expansion year over year, backed by growing demand for its AI-powered solution suite across industries. Management\u2019s policy to expand its portfolio with a strong focus on innovations and strategic buyouts is a tailwind.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nDuring the first quarter, IBM introduced LinuxONE 4 Express, an advanced data center solution designed to provide cybersecurity, scalability and AI inferencing for hybrid cloud environments. The solution\u2019s cutting-edge features make it suitable for a multitude of use cases for startups and small and medium-sized enterprises.\r\n\r\nWith built-in hardware-based security technology and confidential computing capabilities, the solution effectively shields sensitive data and digital assets. It enhances protection against both external threats and insider breaches by enabling scalable isolation for individual workloads.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter, IBM integrated the open-source Mixtral-8x7B large language model into its watsonx AI and data platform. The optimized version of Mixtral-8x7B, developed by Mistral AI, showcases impressive performance gains. Internal tests reveal a remarkable 50% increase in throughput compared to the standard model. By leveraging quantization techniques to reduce the model size and memory requirements, IBM anticipates significant reductions in latency, potentially ranging from 35% to 75%, depending on batch size. These are likely to have driven the top-line growth in the Software segment.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, IBM collaborated with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry. The collaboration is likely to facilitate higher productivity and help accelerate business transformation in consumer-packaged goods and retail firms. Leveraging indigenous IBM technologies such as IBM Garage methodology, the company aims to help business enterprises undergo rapid digital transformation by embracing generative AI.\r\n\r\nIBM is further likely to help the clients complement SAP solutions with IBM watsonx. The collaboration will help wholesale distributors and retailers improve product distribution by feeding external data such as weather, traffic and local events into the SAP Direct Distribution solution and apply AI to identify optimal store delivery routes to reduce costs.\r\n\r\nIBM also collaborated with Riyadh Air to enhance travel experiences, harnessing the power of IBM Consulting's expertise in AI, technology and operations. The state-of-the-art project aims to leverage cutting-edge digital technologies to incorporate easy-to-deploy and easy-to-access AI-powered systems and expand the scope of in-flight. These are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the Consulting segment.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $14,525 million. It generated revenues of $14,252 million in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.60 per share, indicating growth from $1.36 in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for IBM for the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.86%, with the former pegged at $1.58 and the latter at $1.59.

        "content": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 18, 2024 / IBM\n\nOriginally published in the IBM 2023 Impact Report\n\nIBM has set a target of reaching operational net zero GHG emissions by 2030 with 350,000 metric tons or less of residual CO2 emissions. This requires that we reduce our current operational emissions as much as possible through energy conservation - increasing operational efficiency and energy conservation and reducing energy consumption.\n\nOne of the key challenges is data. In sustainability, it's a popular saying that you can't manage what you don't measure. Jimmy McDonough, Global Energy Manager at IBM Global Real Estate, knows the key to address this - artificial intelligence (AI) powered tools.\n\nIn 2023, AI allowed Jimmy and other teams at IBM to capture and analyze IBM's energy data within a single, auditable tool across a portfolio of over 600 locations. With this, the company can pull reports and filter by location, geography, and utility, among others, to understand where energy consumption is highest, where there are unexpected changes in energy, and where the company has the most opportunity to drive energy conservation to help meet our 2030 net zero target.\n\nFor Jimmy and other IBMers, embedding this philosophy and strategy across the company's operations generates new insights that can create new energy conservation opportunities.\n\nLearn more about how IBM is embedding its net zero goal in its business operations using AI in the 2023 Impact Report\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Britain\u2019s biggest trade union group warns the U.K. is losing a \u201crace against time\u201d to regulate AI before firms use the technology to make biased hires based on facial recognition and tone of voice.\n\nThe Trades Union Congress (TUC), which represents 48 workers\u2019 unions making up 5.5 million members, published a \u201cready-to-go\u201d bill Friday that seeks to stop employers from using AI to hire, manage, and fire staff.\n\nThe pace of change in AI means U.K. law is simply failing to keep pace with how firms could be adopting the technology to streamline their HR processes, to the detriment of workers, the TUC assistant general secretary Kate Bell.\n\n\u201cOther countries are regulating workplace AI \u2013 so that staff and employers know where they stand. The UK can\u2019t afford to drag its feet and become an international outlier,\u201d she said.\n\nThe TUC set up an AI task force months ago to drive its research, which included the Alan Turing Institute and the Institute for the Future of Work.\n\nThe union group and YouGov surveyed more than 2,300 U.K. adults, finding seven out of 10 people thought workers should be consulted before a firm introduces AI in the workplace.\n\nDespite this, firms have typically pressed ahead with implementing AI to manage staff.\n\nIndeed, one of the early major use cases for AI has been in human resources (HR).\n\nIBM has heralded the benefits of AI in HR, which it says include payroll processing, employee records management, and benefits administration in addition to hiring and firing.\n\nLast year, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote in Fortune that the company had been able to reduce the number of staff working on relatively menial HR tasks from 700 to 50 with the help of AI.\n\nWorkers fighting back against AI\n\nWhile bosses are enthusiastic about streamlining management costs and potentially finding more suitable candidates, the workers they\u2019re seeking to hire, manage, and fire are far from convinced.\n\nThe research from TUC and YouGov found 77% opposed the use of AI to make hiring decisions, while 86% were against the use of the technology to make firing decisions.\n\n\u201cWorkers already face the effects of AI systems through increased surveillance, biased hiring systems and shoddy management algorithms. And this Bill would prevent pseudo-science emotion recognition systems from being used in workplaces,\u201d said Gina Neff, executive director of the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge.\n\nEuan Blair\u2019s apprenticeship unicorn Multiverse acquired Searchlight, which uses a unique AI loop to improve employers\u2019 hiring success while aiming to reduce biases that can crop up in the recruitment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, workers carry serious reservations about the use of AI in the hiring process, and companies that implement it may be waving goodbye to the best talent.A survey published last year by Pew Research Center found two-thirds of Americans wouldn\u2019t apply for a job where AI was used as part of the hiring process.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "IBM (IBM) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $14.57 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.22% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM?\n\nFor IBM, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.61%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that IBM would post earnings of $3.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.87, delivering a surprise of +2.38%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nIBM doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "AMD's Cost-Effective Strategy Is Intelligent, but the Valuation Is Troubling",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the world's favorite artificial intelligence investments currently. I believe its position in the market is very clever, as it focuses on appealing to cost-conscious buyers still looking for advanced computation capabilities. However, I think we should remember that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) by far offers the most expansive ecosystem for AI, and it is developing this into something truly special. AMD can compete in the portion of the market it is targeting, but the long-term prospects for the stock remain speculative given the present valuation multiples.\n\nOperations analysis\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nAMD is one of the most compelling companies working in AI chip development, but its most significant, and certainly stronger, competitor is Nvidia. For quite some time, I have been concerned about whether the valuation of the stock is too risky, and it is fair to say the investment comes with potential valuation drawbacks, even though the company's future growth looks good. I do believe the market has slightly gotten ahead of itself here with too much enthusiasm, and a correction could occur. But it must be said that AMD is firing on all cylinders as it relates to becoming even more significant in AI and, as such, I can see why the market has placed such a premium on the shares. One has to question, though, whether this premium is market enthusiasm or wider speculation from non-professional investors who are not tuned in enough to the fundamentals and instead just want to invest in AI.\n\nThe company is not just a powerhouse in advanced chips, where its production of central processing units and graphics processing units are key to operating AI technologies. It also offers a range of products and services for high-level computers. It is becoming apparent that it may be able to offer some competitive advantage over Nvidia in certain areas. While Nvidia is focused long term on the full-stack market for AI, similar to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, but specializing in AI services, AMD is focused on selling elite capabilities of compute at good value for money. The company is focusing on performance per dollar and innovative technologies at accessible prices, but the market notices this is an exceptional strategy. Unfortunately, it perhaps leaves little room for outside investors to reap the benefits at this time without taking on excess valuation risk because of how widely spread it is being accepted that AMD's strategy is onto something vital.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer analysis\n\nMy research has shown me that Nvidia's current position in the market is undoubtedly the strongest. In second place behind it, I believe, is AMD. But also important are Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) in GPUs, ARM, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in CPUs and servers and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Samsung (SSNLF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in custom semiconductor solutions. It is quite clear that the clever and best companies involved in technology software and hardware want to flesh out their own AI divisions, but there still comes the point where some outsourcing is necessary for top-level results. Apple produces its own chips now, which is its role in custom solutions, but other computer manufacturers who do not have the same trillion-dollar-plus market cap are going to be looking to Nvidia, AMD, Intel and others to provide the chips to fuel the demand for ever-increasing power in laptops, desktops and intelligent devices.\n\nAs smaller hardware companies seek to join the ranks of companies who offer AI integrated with devices, I believe AMD has the strongest competitive positioning if it continues to hone in on cost-effective advanced CPUs and GPUs. By doing so, it caters to a critical part of the market that other providers would be less focused on as they serve the larger, full-stack needs of conglomerates, big data companies and those working with highly advanced technology like robotics.\n\nHowever, suppose AMD fails to flesh out its AI ecosystem effectively. In that case, it might lose out in its current target market to Nvidia more than investors are currently pricing into the stock. What customers are going to want is ease of access to advanced AI tasks. Beyond pure compute provision, a unified platform to manage AI workloads that Nivida is aiming for with its full-stack approach may be much more compelling in the long run as AI tasks become more complex and demand for advanced capabilities scales. This should apply even to smaller companies that can afford it. While AMD has partnerships to help in this regard, its profitability will suffer if it does not provide the core foundation for the demanded capabilities.\n\nOn that note, I am particularly keen on AMD's balance sheet, which shows an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.82. In comparison, Nvidia's ratio is 0.65, while Broadcom's is just 0.40. I believe AMD's strength in its balance sheet will serve it well with any needs that may arise where it needs to invest more heavily in full-stack solutions. The company can notably take on more debt without too much damage to its financial agility or sense of security for shareholders.\n\nValuation\n\nFirst, consider the following chart, which presents the main valuation multiples of what I consider to be some of the most competitive peers to AMD:\n\nAMD Nvidia Intel Broadcom ARM P/E Ratio Without NRI 116 71.6 35.8 32.4 165.6 P/S Ratio 12 35.6 2.9 15 44.6 P/FCF Ratio 241.8 80.4 NM 31.5 171.9\n\nFrom the above chart, it is quite clear that AMD sells at a very high multiples, but we can also see its multiples are not uncommon in its industry for the major players, other than its free cash flow ratio, which is the highest of all the five peers listed. I believe there is some truth to the statement that AMD is investing heavily in future growth, so it is taking a profitability hit in the near term in exchange for long-term gains. I do believe AMD will stabilize its profitability in due course, and then its price-earnings multiples will become much more tolerable. But as we can see, its revenue growth has shown to be very promising, which is indicated in the lower price-sales ratio against Nvidia, ARM Holdings and Broadcom.\n\nIn my opinion, the valuation for AMD is not intolerable, but it certainly exposes investors to a lot of risks if it struggles in achieving expectations or if it struggles to manifest long-term profitability at a scale that investors are currently anticipating. It has proven it can generate rapid and lasting revenue growth, and I am certain in time, it will translate this into a stronger bottom line, but there is also the consideration of growing expenditures to remain competitive, especially as it relates to my comments about it not having a full-stack ecosystem, which it may decide it needs to develop, albeit at a smaller scale to Nvidia, to remain relevant. Therefore, I can see some long-term risk here which could cause present enthusiasm to deflate, and I think investors who bought in at present prices run the risk of losing a significant amount of capital if adverse conditions arise.\n\nPutting the AI market valuation risks into perspective\n\nI view AMD very favorably, so I think the market has priced the shares high for a reason. Based on my research of the industry, I have come to believe the present AI enthusiasm is not a bubble like during the internet boom of the 1990s. Instead, the results of this technological shift look to be much more profound and lasting, but the potential for speculative behavior still remains. While in the 1990s, many companies went to zero, in this period, I believe the potential for speculation simply means more likelihood of volatility.\n\nI do not think we will see as many failed companies, primarily due to the expensive barriers to entry, but also because the financial benefits of AI will cause fundamental growth like margin expansion and potential deflationary effects on the wider economy. That will make AI businesses worth much more than dot-com companies were over the long term. AMD has proven itself to be a stand-out player, and so the likelihood is short-to-medium-term volatility with long-term growth. Now just does not seem to be the most prudent time to allocate to the company as a value investor.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nI think AMD could have periods of turbulence, but as long as it continues to allocate its resources with an effective strategy aimed at value and does not find it needs to invest too heavily in expensive new technologies, which may disrupt its long-term profitability, I believe the long-term returns should be good. It is not quite right for my risk appetite, and I do not believe it works for investors heavily focused on stock valuations, but nonetheless, the company's operations are undeniably strong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "After Plunging -5.45% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why the Trend Might Reverse for IBM (IBM)",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 5.5% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.\n\nHere is How to Spot Oversold Stocks\n\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\n\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.\n\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\n\nWhy IBM Could Bounce Back Before Long\n\nThe RSI reading of 28.81 for IBM is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.\n\nThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering IBM in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\n\nMoreover, IBM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best machine learning stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the machine learning industry, go directly to the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe concepts of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used interchangeably. However, that is not the case as machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data, make predictions, and automate tasks without explicit programming. On the other hand, artificial intelligence includes a broader range of techniques that aim to create systems capable of human-like intelligence, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global AI market was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2023 and 2032, reaching $2.575 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. Precedence Research estimated machine learning's market value at $38.11 billion in 2022 and expects it to reach $771.38 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 35.09% over the projected period, between 2023 and 2032.\n\nCompanies Leveraging Machine Learning\n\nWhile there are a handful of companies that are actively working on developing products toward the advancement of machine learning, there are many companies that depend on machine learning technology to run their operations. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) leverages machine learning to influence content creation decisions and personalize the user interface. Moreover, the company\u2019s recommendation system uses ML to analyze user behavior and provide personalized content suggestions. Netflix, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to deliver tailored content experiences to its subscribers drives user retention and platform growth. The company made the following comments in one of its articles:\n\n\u201cAt Netflix, the Machine Learning Platform (MLP) team has been investing in research to push the boundaries of ML Performance over the years. Our state-of-the-art ML performance infrastructure serves as a strong foundation to leverage the latest research in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Infrastructure, GPU Memory Management, Graph Neural Networks, and more recently Large Language Models. We are building an increasingly active engagement with Academia and have a quickly growing graduate ML Internship program that brings us both new talent & the latest research, providing a bridge between university labs and fast-growing industry applications.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial services institution, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been using AI/ML for over a decade. In the company\u2019s 2023 annual letter to shareholders, its chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon said that the company now has over 2,000 AI/ML experts and data scientists. Dimon considers AI an \u201cextraordinary\u201d technology and believes that it is \u201cas transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years\u201d such as electricity and the internet. He said:\n\n\u201cWe have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years \u2014 and now have over 400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk \u2014 and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe, responsible way.\n\nWhile we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.\u201d\n\nHe further added that the organization understands the importance of AI and for that reason, it has created a new position, chief data and analytics officer.\n\nCompeting With Nvidia in the AI Space\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) took the markets by storm and was the top-performing Magnificent 7 stock in 2023, gaining nearly 240%. The surge was attributed to limited competition in the AI accelerator market. However, other companies have been making strides to take over NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). On April 9, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled its new AI chip, Gaudi 3. According to the company, the chip is \u201cpurpose-built for high-performance, high-efficiency GenAI compute\u201d. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) claims that compared to NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100, Gaudi 3 is much more power-efficient and faster.\n\nOn April 10, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) introduced its new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), an upgrade to MTIA v1 that was introduced last year. The chip has been designed for Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) in-house AI workloads, and to decrease its dependency on NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The new MTIA version more than doubled the compute and memory bandwidth while maintaining a focus on efficiently serving recommendation models. According to the company, MTIA is part of its long-term plan to build a strong and efficient infrastructure for handling its AI tasks.\n\nWith the above information in mind, some of the best machine learning stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\nA researcher studying a machine learning model of a metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through internet rankings of AI stocks and ML stocks, including our own, in addition to the holdings of Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ), iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO), and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) to come up with 25 potential ML stocks. We then looked into each company's products and services to further refine our list to include AI companies that are actively working toward the development and advancement of machine learning. We narrowed down our selection to 13 stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In\n\n13. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is engaged in machine learning through its research division, Baidu Research, and products, including Baidu Machine Learning (BML) and a deep-learning framework, PaddlePaddle.

(NASDAQ:BIDU) is one of the best machine-learning stocks to invest in. Other such stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAriel Investments stated the following regarding Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBy comparison, China\u2019s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) traded lower alongside Chinese equities as intensifying problems in China weighed on investor sentiment during the period. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and recently launched its generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China\u2019s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu\u2019s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.\u201d\n\n12.

IBM\u2019s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.\u201d\n\n11. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that utilizes machine learning to enhance its offering of cybersecurity.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel\u2019s. We invested on the the belief that AMD\u2019s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD\u2019s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Major Cities with the Highest Home Price Increases Since the Pandemic Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Amidst an abundance of investing opportunities, certain stocks tend to go unnoticed. Nonetheless, three profitable prospects have been found in government sector services, AI integration, and cannabis. These stocks are notable for their strategic moves and prospective trajectories.\n\nIn the context of cannabis legalization, the first one has exhibited impressive revenue growth, surpassing that of both S&P 500 firms and their industry competitors. The company is bolstering its market presence and laying the groundwork for future revenue growth by developing its retail banners and strategic partnerships. On the other hand, the second one ushers in a new era of user involvement and data security. It is executed through the browser integration of local large language models (LLMs).\n\nFinally, the third one\u2019s federally approved status in government sector services highlights the company\u2019s adherence to strict security guidelines and establishes it as a reliable partner for federal agencies. Overall, these companies\u2019 choices glimpse the potential for high-flying gains, allowing them to optimize returns in an increasingly volatile market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSNDL (SNDL) Business marijuana leaves cannabis stocks success market price green arrow up profit growth charts graph money display screen up industry trend grow higher quickly / Commercial cannabis medicine money\n\nSource: Bigc Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last quarters,\u00a0SNDL (NASDAQ:SNDL) has showcased its unique selling points and outstanding sales growth. Its revenue has risen in seven of the last eight quarters, outpacing its peers in the cannabis industry and even the average growth rate of S&P 500 firms. With a remarkable compound annual growth rate of 123% over the last three years, SNDL has proven its ability to seize market share. The company\u2019s net revenue from its retail banners climbed by 28% over 2022, reaching a record $909 million.\n\nSNDL\u2019s growth trajectory is promising. Its focus on supporting partners\u2019 growth and expanding its retail presence is evident in its cooperation with\u00a0Nova Cannabis. This has led to the assignment of four cannabis retail outlets to Nova and the renewal of SNDL\u2019s credit facility.\n\nFinally, SNDL is acquiring the Dutch Love Stores, increasing its total to 190 direct and indirect cannabis stores across all retail banners, while Nova reaches 100 total stores. Hence, this expansion strengthens SNDL\u2019s position in the market and opens up new avenues for revenue development and market penetration in key areas like British Columbia.\n\nOpera (OPRA) A phone displaying the Opera (OPRA) app\n\nSource: bangoland / Shutterstock.com\n\nOpera (NASDAQ:OPRA) stands out with its unique competitive advantage- the integration of local LLMs into its Opera One browser. This innovative feature allows users to manage and access over 150 local LLM variations from 50 model families directly in the browser.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncluding such a vast number of local LLM variations demonstrates Opera\u2019s deep and diverse AI options, satisfying a wide range of user demands and preferences. Hence, this unique feature may increase user engagement and grow Opera\u2019s user base, setting it apart from its competitors.\n\nAdditionally, Opera\u2019s local LLM implementation ensures that users\u2019 data stays locally on their devices, removing the requirement to send data to external servers. Thus, emphasizing data security and privacy can increase the company\u2019s growth potential. For users to properly use these models, 2\u201310 GB of local storage space is needed for each LLM variation.\n\nTo conclude, Opera has access to a top search engine by expanding its\u00a0collaboration with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, this improves the user base through sharp browsing and Opera\u2019s income base.\n\nUiPath (PATH) The UiPath (PATH) app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe\u00a0FedRAMP-approved status of UiPath (NYSE:PATH) denotes adherence to strict security requirements for cloud services accessible by federal government entities. This suggests UiPath\u2019s broad reach inside the public sector and highlights its lead in public sector organizations, U.S. state governments, and federal agencies.\n\nAdditionally, UiPath introduces new generative AI (GenAI) functionalities, including document processing and communications-specific models like DocPATH and CommPATH. Moreover, to improve the precision and functionality of AI models, the company focuses on the significance of context grounding and business-specific data integration.\n\nNotably, UiPath and\u00a0IBM (NYSE:IBM) work together to include Watsonx.ai capabilities into UiPath\u2019s platform, giving users access to fundamental AI models. According to the statement, UiPath Autopilot is used by over 1,500 companies, producing solid weekly numbers for production and expression.\n\nFinally, prebuilt GenAI activities provide a fundamental edge for UiPath. They speed up the adoption of AI capabilities in automation processes and minimize development time. The particular GenAI use cases that emphasize the adaptability of these prebuilt activities include language translation and email text completion. In short, Prebuilt GenAI activities make it easier to include AI capabilities in automation processes.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best nanotechnology stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our introduction to the nanotechnology sector and how it covers a variety of applications ranging from healthcare to consumer technology, then you can skip ahead to read 5 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In.\n\nJust like artificial intelligence, nanotechnology is another set of technologies that once belonged to the realm of science fiction. Nanotechnology refers to items that are smaller than 100 nanometers. These are used in a wide variety of applications, such as sunscreen and medicines since the small size of the particles allows them to behave in ways that regularly sized items cannot.\n\nOne of the most lucrative applications of nanotechnology comes in the semiconductor industry. Modern day chips, such as those that power Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone or the latest artificial intelligence graphics processing units from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), are made of transistors that are often as small as just a couple of nanometers. In fact, the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is currently mass producing semiconductors with feature sizes as small as 3 nanometers. Nothing short of magic, making transistors that are just nanometers wide or long provides chips with dozens of benefits over their predecessors, with the most evident ones being improved electrical conductivity, better power efficiency, and of course, higher computing power.\n\nAnother well known user of nanotechnology is the medical industry. It is used for a wide variety of direct and indirect medicinal purposes, such as treating cancer, imaging diseases, and even making new tissues. One such company is the Paris, France based biotechnology firm Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX). A specialized biotechnology firm, Nanobiotix uses nano particles to fight cancers of the head, pancreas, and other regions and organs of the human body. The three analysts that cover the stock have rated the shares as Strong Buy on average, and priced in a hefty upside through an average share price target of $11.98. In fact, April 2024 is turning out to be a crucial month for Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX) as the firm completed the dose escalation portion of its first phase trial of a lung cancer treatment called NBTXR3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe treatment targets small cell lung cancer, and it is aimed to help specifically those patients who cannot be treated by surgery or those who have seen their cancer return after earlier bouts of radiation therapy. It uses hafnium oxide nano particles, and Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX) is optimistic that while the current trial is only working with lung cancer patients, future uses of NBTXR3 could apply to other cancers as well given hafnium oxide's mechanism of action. Wall Street, it seems, is having a hard time believing the firm, as the stock is down by 15% year to date.\n\nHowever, while Nanobiotix hasn't done well this year, what about the broader nanotechnology sector? Since nanotechnology covers a wide variety of use cases, some of which we've covered above, it is difficult to ascribe to the sector defined determinants of share price performance. In other words, for example, while the broader biotechnology sector tends to underperform when interest rates are high, the same cannot be said with certainty for all nanotechnology firms.\n\nYet, we can see how stock indexes that allow investors to track the sector are doing. One such stock index is the S&P Kensho Nanotechnology Index. It tracks \"companies that produce nanoscale materials, as well as those that use nanotechnology in their production lines or that build machines capable of measuring information at the nanoscale,\" which provides it exposure to the broader nanotechnology sector as opposed to customized use cases such as chips and medicines. So how are these nanotechnology stocks performing? Well, the index is up by 9.48% year to date, however, its performance over the past 12 months and three years hasn't been too encouraging. Over these two time periods, the S&P Kensho Nanotechnology Index has been negative 7.5% and negative 25.10%. These time periods have been marked by global economic turbulence in the form of soaring inflation, rising interest rates, and wars - which appear to have made their mark on nanotechnology stocks as well.\n\nSo, if you were wondering which nanotechnology stocks to buy, we made one such list today. Some top picks are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). 11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In\n\nIrina Kozorog/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best nanotechnology stocks, we looked at our previous coverage and some other nano medicine firms and ranked the companies by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023. Out of these, those nanotechnology stocks with the highest number of hedge fund shareholders were chosen.\n\nFor these best nanotechnology stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In\n\n11. PPG Industries, Inc.

        "content": "The S&P 500 notched a marvelous rally in the first three months of 2024, banking on AI optimism and hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the second half of this year.\n\nHowever, the broader index has experienced a topsy-turvy ride so far this month. This is because of a hotter-than-expected rise in consumer prices and an uptick in wholesale prices that dampened the chances of any rate cuts soon.\n\nEven though the prices of indispensable goods and services dropped significantly from their peak of 9.1% in June 2022, they remain well above the coronavirus pandemic mark.\n\nThe Labor Department noted that the consumer price index increased 0.4% month over month in March and rose 3.5% from a year ago, the biggest gain in six months. Analysts had projected a gain of 0.3% sequentially and an increase of 3.4% year over year.\n\nThe increase in gasoline and shelter costs largely contributed to the rise in consumer prices. Wholesale prices also heated up last month. In the 12 months ending in March, the producer price index increased 2.1%, up from February\u2019s gain of 1.6%. An increase in service prices mostly drove wholesale prices higher, added the Labor Department.\n\nNeedless to say, an increase in price pressures will compel the Fed to hold rates steady, which are already at record highs. Higher rates curtail consumer outlays, jack up borrowing costs, derail economic growth and lead to gyration in the stock market.\n\nThe S&P 500, thus, has retreated more than 1% so far in April despite ending the last trading session in the green. In reality, the S&P 500 was tantalizingly close to its 50-day moving average (DMA) on Apr 11.\n\nWhile trading at its session low on Thursday, the S&P 500 was within 33 points of its 50 DMA. It was the closest level the index had reached to its 50 DMA since Nov 2, per FactSet data.\n\nLest we forget that if the index had fallen below the 50 DMA, it was destined to decline further. Hence, in such a precarious scenario, astute investors should play safe and invest in stocks such as Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, Organon & Co. OGN and International Business MachinesCorporation IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks carry a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1), making them immune to market upheavals. They also provide dividends, a tell-tale sign that they have a sound business model that helps them counter market vagaries. They have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.3%.\n\nOrganon is a healthcare company.

        "title": "International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.07 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 indicates a change of +5.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.2%. The $63.79 billion and $66.59 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.1% and +4.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $17.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $3.87 for the same period compares with $3.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.59%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "IBM (IBM) closed the latest trading day at $189.82, indicating a +0.36% change from the previous session's end. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.03%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.03%.\n\nThe technology and consulting company's stock has dropped by 3.48% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.26% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.57%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of IBM in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.59, signifying a 16.91% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $14.56 billion, indicating a 2.18% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.07 per share and revenue of $63.79 billion, which would represent changes of +4.68% and +3.12%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Right now, IBM possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to valuation, IBM is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.79. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 17.05 of its industry.\n\nAlso, we should mention that IBM has a PEG ratio of 3.71. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.53.\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 66, finds itself in the top 27% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He\u2019s been investing for over 80 years so there are bound to be a few blow ups along the way.\n\nWhat can we learn from his biggest mistakes?\n\n3 Biggest Value Investing Mistakes\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying in a difficult industry where there are few moats\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Holding the company too long, even when the business has changed or its not performing\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buying an expensive stock\n\nBuffett\u2019s Hits, Misses and Mistakes\n\n1. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of IBM in 2011 around $170 a share. By 2018, Berkshire had sold out of the investment in the range of $140 to $150. Berkshire took a loss.\n\nBuffett later said IBM wasn\u2019t performing as he thought it would and that\u2019s why he got out. But it took him 8 years to finally exit the position completely. During that period, IBM\u2019s earnings fell year-over-year in 2014, 2015 and 2016 with little rebound in 2017 and 2018.\n\nShould Buffett had sold earlier when falling earnings became more than just a 1-off at IBM?\n\n2. Bank of America (BAC)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway bought Bank of America in the third quarter of 2017. It still owns a big position.\n\nEarnings at Bank of America popped during the pandemic, rising to $3.56 in 2021 from $1.87 in 2020. But earnings are expected to fall this year by 9%.\n\nBank of America is still cheap with a P/B ratio of just 1.1.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Buffett making a mistake in still holding Bank of America?\n\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought Amazon shares in the first quarter of 2019. It\u2019s a small position in the equity portfolio. At the time, many were confused by the purchase because Amazon sported a sky-high P/E ratio and didn\u2019t seem to be a traditional \u201cvalue\u201d stock.\n\nAmazon is cheaper now, with a forward P/E of 44. Earnings plunged in 2022, but they have been rebounding. In 2023, Amazon made $2.80 per share and the Zacks Consensus is looking for $4.08 in 2024.\n\nShares are up 105.2% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 through Apr 2, 2024. That\u2019s beating the S&P 500, up 84.4% during the same time.\n\nWas Amazon too expensive when Buffett bought it in 2019?\n\n4. Chevron Corp. (CVX)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Chevron in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then bought a bigger position in 2021. At the time, Chevron was dirt cheap on a fundamental basis. It remains cheap, with a forward P/E of 12.\n\nChevron shares are up 90.3% since the last day of the fourth quarter of 2020. That easily beats the return of the S&P 500 during that same time of 39.1%.\n\nDoes it pay to buy the dirt-cheap stocks like Chevron over the long term?\n\n5. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Apple in the first quarter of 2016. It has since become a cornerstone of the Berkshire business and is the largest position in the equity portfolio.\n\nShares are no longer cheap, however. When Berkshire originally bought, Apple was trading around 10x forward earnings. It is currently trading at 25.8x. But earnings growth has stalled out the last few years.\n\nApple made $6.11 in fiscal 2022 and $6.12 in fiscal 2023. It\u2019s expected to see some growth in fiscal 2024 as the Zacks Consensus is looking for $6.55.\n\nIs Apple flashing the warnings signs that maybe it\u2019s business is changing?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Learning from Buffett\u2019s Investing Mistakes?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN and CVX in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Quantum computing will bring about the next computing revolution that will overshadow the prescient artificial intelligence (AI) craze. There are certain kinds of problems that are effectively impossible or inefficient for conventional, classical computers to solve, but not for quantum computers. This has led many investors to seek out the best quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nNovel quantum computers can be a gamechanger in terms of\u00a0current cryptography methods and could also allow for the introduction of completely private communication. Complex problems in optimization, machine learning and simulation will also become solvable with quantum computing.\n\nInvestors who are already looking for the next market sensation are considering a few names in the nascent quantum computing space. Wall Street has caught wind of some of the quantum computing names that could make successful plays in the long term. Below are three such\u00a0quantum computing stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), one of the most established companies in the tech industry, has been working on quantum computers since the early 2000s. For example, in 2001, IBM researchers had already been performing quantum computing techniques to solve cryptography problems. IBM\u2019s quantum computer consists of superconducting qubits that operate at near-zero temperatures. The tech giant also offers a cloud-based quantum computing service called IBM Quantum Experience, which allows customers and researchers to access its quantum hardware and software through the cloud rather than spending a lot of cash to buy a physical quantum computer.\n\nIn recent years, IBM has endured single-digit revenue growth, including in 2023, but the tech giant has continued to beat estimates in their recent Q4\u20192023 earnings report. Both revenue and earnings figures came above what Wall Street analysts had projected; IBM also found itself flush with more free cash flow than it had anticipated. More breakthroughs in quantum computing could spur revenue growth in the future. IBM expects to it won\u2019t have a practical quantum computer until the end of the decade, which makes IBM a compelling long-term hold.\n\nStory continues\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) happens to be the first pure-play\u00a0among publicly traded quantum computing stocks and it will be the only pure-play quantum computing player to make this list. The company is a leader in trapped-ion quantum computing, which uses electrically charged atoms to store and manipulate qubits.\n\nTo date, the company claims to have built the world\u2019s\u00a0most powerful quantum computer which has achieved a quantum capacity 32 qubits.\u00a0IonQ plans to launch modular quantum computers by the end of 2023. To make the computing power of its quantum computers more accessible, IonQ has made its quantum computing power accessible to customers and developers through large cloud platforms.\n\nIonQ ended 2023 with another successful quarter. Fourth-quarter\u00a0earnings results saw the quantum computing firm generate full-year revenue figures well above the high end of its guidance range. This was the same for bookings. IonQ also announced the production of its Enterprise Forte quantum computer in its Seattle manufacturing facility. Deliveries for these quantum systems are slated for the end of 2024.\n\nIonQ\u2019s shares are down almost 25% on a year-to-date basis, which could make a good entry point for new investors or investors willing to increase their investment. Quantum computing, similar to generative AI, has the potential to be the next big thing in technology, and IonQ is at the forefront of the space. You can see why this made our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlush with cash, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) has made a variety of investments in various computing technologies over the past two decades. The company also has been developing quantum computers since 2006 and achieved a milestone in 2019 when it demonstrated \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d or the ability of a quantum computer to perform a task that is impossible for a classical computer.\n\nGoogle\u2019s quantum computer, called Sycamore, used 54 qubits to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer much longer to complete. Although\u00a0some researchers have claimed to be able to do what Google\u2019s Sycamore had done by using a normal supercomputer, Google is continuously working on improving its quantum hardware, software and algorithms. And the results are promising. The new version of Sycamore apparently can make calculations that would take supercomputers 47 years to complete.\n\nIn order to bring about more use-cases for quantum computing, Google has launched a 3-year competition with a $5 million prize for researchers who can come up with new quantum algorithms that can solve existing problems humanity faces. This kind of investment could definitely help steer the new sector in the right direction.\n\nIn its Q4\u20192023 earnings report, cloud continued to be the\u00a0company\u2019s growth engine, growing 26% on a year over year (YOY). In the long term, quantum computing could be an even bigger growth engine for Google.

Tapping into IBM's open-source AI framework, communities will be able to shape and contribute to the Spanish LLM, that will also include co-official languages (Catalan, Basque, Galician and Valencian) increasing innovation, transparency and safety while ensuring a more cost-efficient yet technologically competitive position in the market. The collaboration also reflects the intention to develop AI-enhanced techniques to accelerate the discovery, development, and validation of new materials to increase the sustainability of the semiconductors value chain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"AI positions us at the threshold of a new industrial revolution, with a very significant potential impact in terms of productivity gains for a large number of economic sectors and in providing better public services to our citizens,\" said the minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1. \"The Government of Spain is promoting a useful and ethical development of the opportunities offered by this technology. IBM, with its experience, knowledge, and resources, is an excellent partner to accompany us in our vision.\"\n\n\"IBM shares this bold vision to accelerate the Government of Spain's AI strategy and to be the national AI partner for Spain,\" said Dar\u00edo Gil, IBM SVP and Director of IBM Research. \"We will leverage IBM's deep investments across the entire AI stack, from compute to models, we will enable an open community to drive the full potential of AI technologies.\u00a0Together, we will work to foster the responsible use of AI to drive sustainable growth in Spain, and all Spanish speaking countries worldwide.\"\n\nSpanish is the second leading spoken language in the world (6.2% of the world's population1). One of the priority areas under this MoU is to collaborate in a leading suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages. Creating models that are entirely designed in Spanish will enhance AI sustainability by reducing biases and providing competitive alternatives for the Spanish industry. These models will be refined using advanced tuning and alignment techniques, encompassing innovative methods that facilitate direct community enhancements and foster an ecosystem of AI creators and builders, utilizing assets developed through this collaboration.\n\nRecent advances in generative AI and AI supercomputing hold tremendous promise for governments and economies who can realize the productivity gains enabled by these technologies. With this collaboration, the Government of Spain is taking decisive action to seize this opportunity with timely and transformative commitments to invest in the AI revolution.\n\nThe coordination within the government institutions in this field will facilitate both widespread use of AI across national, regional, and local economies, as well as the timely and sufficient resources needed to build competitive advantages within a rapidly evolving AI-driven commercial landscape. This includes investment in human capital (upskilling and tooling) and community-driven adoption of AI to ensure that the productivity benefits and economic gains can positively impact across the economy of Spain, from small-medium sized businesses (SMBs) to large enterprises and the public sector.\n\nTaking this into account, the Memorandum of Understanding is based on five principles;\n\nPromote the development of a suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages. Collaborate on the research and development of a full stack generative AI platform, including software built on open-source frameworks and tools as well as infrastructure enabling hardware diversity. Promote national and regional AI strategies through a cooperative approach that promotes a responsible use of the foundation models and the associated generative AI platform.

        "title": "Passive Income Perfection: 7 Dividend Stocks to Generate $50,000 Per Year",
        "content": "The topic of passive income is popular these days. Investors, consumers, and many other individuals are curious about any method that can produce income without work. Dividend stocks are an excellent example of one such method. In fact, investors can buy dividend stocks for $50,000 per year income.\n\nDividend stocks are one of the most reliable sources of passive income available. Investors have been using dividends to create wealth for hundreds of years, in fact several hundred years. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company began paying dividends to its investors. The trend continues today and has been well refined through time tested methods.\n\nLet\u2019s also be realistic here, $50,000 per year in passive income from dividends requires a substantial portfolio. at an average 5% yield an investor will need $1 million in dividend bearing stocks to create $50K in income yearly. Let\u2019s take a look at seven stocks to consider that can get any investor to that goal with enough time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has transitioned from an investment bank to a firm more oriented toward wealth management in recent times. That transition has made it one of the better dividend stocks to consider for investors seeking passive income.\n\nMy colleague Charles Munyi outlined the bank\u2019s transition toward wealth management in a recent article. Essentially, Morgan Stanley bought up several advisories in the wake of the 2008-2009 crisis. The result is that the company now derives a much greater percentage of revenues from wealth management. This makes it one of those stocks for $50,000 per year income.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s dividend currently yields 3.5% and was last reduced in 2010. It\u2019s also well within the healthy range with a payout ratio of 0.6. The dividend has also grown by nearly 27% over the last 5 years. That\u2019s much higher than the average dividend growth rate of 8 to 10%. Excessive growth can signal risk. In this case the higher rate is probably a representation of the company\u2019s dedication to its shift toward attracting greater wealth management revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltria (MO) packs of cigarettes in convenience store rack\n\nSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) is an exceptional dividend stock overall. The company sits among the ranks of the dividend kings. The dividend kings is an elite group of stocks that have not reduced their dividend payment within the last 50 years. It also yields nearly 9% which is quite high.\n\nThus, it provides an exceptional mix of yields and reliability that no other stock can. The reason that Altria is so unique relates to the nature of its industry which is in transition. The company sells tobacco and its fortunes are underpinned by its ownership of Marlboro. With smoking levels continuing to decline Altria is transitioning to smokeless alternatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s e-cigarette brand, NJOY, doesn\u2019t dominate its market. Instead, it sits in third place overall.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to navigate this transitional period will define the future of its dividend.\n\nMeanwhile, Altria recently bolstered its share repurchase program through the sale of $2.4 billion dollars worth of Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) stock. It all suggests that Altria\u2019s dividend is safe for the midterm at least. For investors seeking $50,000 per year from dividend stocks MO shares are an excellent choice.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock isn\u2019t far behind Altria in terms of reliability: The firm last reduced its dividend in 1983. That dividend is a prime point of attraction for investors. The energy market is a volatile one as the price of oil can fluctuate drastically from year to year. Exxon Mobil\u2019s dividend provides income and returns that smooth that volatility.\n\nThen in boom years like 2022 the company does exceptionally well providing an excellent opportunity for investors to cash out and profit. Investors learned that they can count on Exxon Mobil to continue paying its dividend through the pandemic and that it does create significant wealth creating opportunities at the same time.\n\nExxon Mobil and other energy giants are particularly attractive at the moment. The electric vehicle sector is in disarray and provides a strong antithesis to a rapid oil-free transition. In other words, ExxonMobil stock continues to be a beacon of reliability despite perceived challenges.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) A photo of a paper with a chart and the word \"Dividends\" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.\n\nSource: jittawit21/Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)\u00a0 continues to be an interesting choice among dividend stocks. The company has successfully navigated through the transition of Humira going off patent. Fear related to that had long plagued the company but it looks like it has mostly survived unscathed.\n\nThe company has successfully introduced other drugs to combat declining revenues. The result is that while revenues are slightly down in 2023 overall, most analysts believe the company has done well.\n\nSimply put, AbbVie wouldn\u2019t be able to continue paying its dividend if the company didn\u2019t manage that transition. Analysts from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) believe that ABBV shares are worth $200. Those analysts believe that earnings will improve as revenues from drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq replace those from Humira.\n\nEarnings is one of the primary areas to focus on for ABBV investors. The stock\u2019s P/E ratio isn\u2019t strong at the moment. However, the company\u2019s diverse portfolio has shown massive turnaround potential of late and those earnings could quickly reverse. That\u2019s essentially what Wells Fargo is saying in attaching a $200 target price to ABBV at present. The company will continue to pay dividends as it has since 1972. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how everything pans out but it looks like AbbVie will emerge stronger.\n\nPepsi (PEP) stock market ticker screen with the word \"dividends\" appearing in large text. Must-Have Dividend Stocks. Dividend kings to own\n\nSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.com\n\nPepsi (NYSE:PEP) is another dividend king, making it a very reliable stock overall. It\u2019s a nice addition to any portfolio for investors seeking to generate $50,000 in dividend income annually.\n\nOne of the most important things to consider when discussing Pepsi is its recent performance in light of inflation. The company has fared very well over the last few years as inflation has become endemic. What\u2019s important to note here is that Pepsi doesn\u2019t only sell beverages, it also has a large portfolio of snack foods. Its beverages and snack foods have become much more expensive. However, consumer\u00a0 demand remains steadfast. In fact, organic revenues increased by nearly 10% in 2023. That suggests Pepsi will now be able to charge those higher prices moving forward.\n\nConsumers shouldn\u2019t expect those prices to\u00a0 revert to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, they should expect a stabilization of prices. That means Pepsi will be able to depend on higher sales you forward and continue to pay a reliable dividend. In fact, Pepsi announced that it will increase its annual dividend by 7% beginning in June.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a stock that represents an intriguing mix of growth and income that should continue to attract investors.\n\nShare prices have appreciated dramatically over the past year. The legacy technology company has essentially positioned itself well in relation to AI. Strong investments have resulted in a book of business that doubled sequentially for AI workloads between the third and fourth quarter. That news served to reaffirm the recent increase in prices which is predicated on its AI potential.\n\nAnyway, That\u2019s The Story of IBM as it relates to growth. The company is well positioned to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other trends like quantum computing.Those opportunities may very well allow the company to shed its image as a legacy firm.\n\nThat\u2019s compelling in and of itself but then add in its dividend and IBM becomes even more attractive. The company is reliable for income investors: It last reduced its dividend in 1994. It all adds up to create a company that represents a unique opportunity for investors looking to build $50k annually in passive income.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is one of many legacy cigarette companies that continues to offer a lot to investors at the moment. The stock provides a dividend yielding more than 5.5% and is relatively stable having last been reduced in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially the same story for Philip Morris as for all other cigarette stocks: these firms are navigating a transition to lower arm tobacco products while relying on cigarettes to underpin their businesses.\n\nIn the case of Philip Morris, that also means taking some risks. The company has to find new sources of revenue to make up for declining smoking rates. The company is buying assets at a rate well in excess of revenue growth. That suggests inefficiency.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s an inefficiency born of necessity. Philip Morris has to find new growth. As it searches for that growth investors should simply take advantage of its dividend. It\u2019s the same story that investors will find in relation to Altria, discussed above.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Diamond Hill Capital, an investment management company, released its \u201cLong-Short Fund\u201d fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The portfolio achieved positive returns in Q4, but it trailed the Russell 1000 Index and the blended benchmark (60% Russell 1000 Index/40% Bloomberg US Treasury Bills 1-3 Month Index).

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 most congested cities in Europe. If you would like to skip our discussion on the trends in traffic, you can go to the 5 Most Congested Cities in Europe.\n\nTraffic congestion plagues cities worldwide, and Europe is no exception. From bustling capitals to historic centers, many European cities struggle with congestion, causing economic losses, wasted time, and environmental concerns. Drivers have to spend hours on the most congested roads in Europe, which leads to stress and frustration. The European University on Responsible Consumption and Production estimates that traffic congestion costs Europe over \u20ac100 billion or 1% of its GDP annually. Moreover, research by INRIX, a transportation data company, has revealed that the worst traffic hotspots in Europe could impose a staggering cost of \u00a3183 billion on drivers by 2025 due to time wasted in jams.\n\nThis highlights the significant economic burden of gridlock. In addition to economic costs, increased congestion can lead to high air pollution and carbonization. Air pollution is estimated to cost 1% of the global GDP and result in 6 to 9 million premature deaths per year by 2060, as per an OECD report. Traffic congestion arises from a complex interplay of factors. Among these are the lack of effective public transport options, especially in developing countries, and infrastructure bottlenecks. It is important to understand the causes in order to address the multi-faceted issue of traffic congestion.\n\nOverview: Traffic Management Market\n\nAs traffic congestion becomes a big issue in cities worldwide, it is no wonder that there is a growing market for traffic management systems globally to fight international traffic congestion. According to a study by Markets and Markets, the industry is expected to grow to $72.5 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 11.4% during the period 2023-2028. Positive forces impacting this market include growing concerns for public safety, especially among governments, and the widespread use of advanced technologies such as sensors and cameras.\n\nStory continues\n\nLocal regulatory requirements can negatively impact the growth of this market. Europe is expected to hold the biggest share of this market during the aforementioned forecast period. This is because of the governments\u2019 substantial spending on improving public transport in this region.\u00a0 Major players in the traffic management system market include Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Kapsch TrafficCom AG (VIE:KTCG), and IBM (NYSE:IBM).\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), a leading player in the traffic management system market, provides IoT solutions to improve roadway safety, lower carbon emissions, and reduce traffic congestion. It also partnered with ASFINAG to connect thousands of sensors and cameras along highways to route data to a central system in Austria. This provided drivers with real-time information about road conditions and helped in routing emergency vehicles.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG (VIE:KTCG), another major name in this industry, is working towards intelligent traffic systems in Europe. It recently signed a contract with German Autobahn GmbH for a cooperative intelligent transport system project. This project would involve setting up mobile barriers at limited-time work sites, which will send warning signals to approaching vehicles. Similarly, IBM (NYSE:IBM) also provides intelligent transport systems with capabilities of traffic prediction and analysis for smarter traffic management. Data is gathered through different devices such as cameras, radars, and under-road loop detectors, along with devices using Bluetooth or wireless technologies. The data is used to measure traffic speed and volume. This system is currently being used by the Finnish Transport Authority.\n\nIBM's (NYSE:IBM) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer shared an update on the company's financial health in its Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\nWe had a solid close to 2023 with growth across our businesses and strong cash generation. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and sustainability of our revenue growth. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2023, delivering revenue growth of 3% and over $11 billion of free cash flow, two-thirds of the way through our midterm model, I am proud of our achievements. Since 2021, we delivered average revenue growth for IBM and for each segment at or above our model. The overall trends we are seeing reinforce our views of the future. We are confident in achieving our midterm revenue model, and the strength of our diversified business model allows us to make progress each quarter. 15 Most Congested Cities in Europe\n\nAI GR/Pixabay.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 15 most congested cities in Europe, we referred to data from TomTom Traffic.

Wroclaw\n\nAverage Travel Time per 10 km: 24 Minutes 40 Seconds\n\nWroclaw, a bustling Polish city on the Oder River with over 634,000 residents, deals with a growing traffic problem. Traffic congestion within the city has earned it the title of Poland's most congested city. Commuters face a monthly delay of over 8.5 hours due to jams, adding up to around 107 hours lost annually in gridlock. This translates to nearly half (45%) of the average driving time wasted in traffic jams.\n\n9.

Bordeaux\n\nAverage Travel Time per 10 km: 26 Minutes 30 Seconds\n\nBordeaux residents spend an average of 253 hours behind the wheel each year, with around 111 hours stuck in traffic jams.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Walmart Inc. WMT, Linde plc LIN, IBM Corp. IBM, Deere & Co. DE and Duke Energy Corp. DUK.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Walmart, Linde and IBM\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc., Linde plc and IBM Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nWalmart\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (+28.1% vs. +26.9%). The company is gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats.\n\nWalmart has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nThe strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled Walmart\u2019s fourth-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\r\n\r\nHowever, the retail landscape continues to be dynamic due to challenges like inflation and volatile consumer spending. High SG&A expenses are also a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+35.0% vs. +30.9%). The company has an extensive range of industrial gas applications that are enhancing global productivity day by day. The company supplies a wide range of gases crucial for various sectors like energy, steel, healthcare, manufacturing and electronics.\r\n\r\nLinde has long-term contracts with on-site customers, backed by minimum purchase requirements, ensuring stable cash flows. Linde\u2019s substantial backlog ensures future earnings potential. The merger of Praxair and Linde has positioned the firm as an efficient player in the profitable industrial gas market, with a considerable size advantage.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising competition for new projects in emerging markets raises concerns. The decrease in U.S. industrial production is also expected to reduce the demand for industrial gases, affecting profits. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>)\r\n\r\nIBM\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+53.9% vs. +42.9%). The company is poised to witness a healthy growth momentum driven by an optimum combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and steady R&D investments.\r\n\r\nHigher demand for hybrid cloud, AI solutions and increased watsonx adoption by clients are tailwinds. IBM\u2019s collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks. In addition, buyouts have negatively impacted the company\u2019s balance sheet in the form of high levels of goodwill and net intangible assets. Foreign exchange volatility remains another concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Deere & Co. and Duke Energy Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the top 20 US states for AI jobs. We have also discussed the growth of AI in the employment landscape in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 US States for AI Jobs.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed exceptional growth since its inception in 1956, reaching new heights with milestones such as the launch of ChatGPT-3.5 in 2022. This technology offers immense benefits for businesses such as automation, enhanced analytics, and improved decision-making powers. As evidenced by Bloomberg Intelligence's projection of a $1.3 trillion market for generative AI by 2032, it's clear that AI adoption is no longer a choice but a necessity for businesses aiming to stay competitive and maximize outcomes.\n\nThe impact of AI on hiring practices is also profound as recruiters are increasingly seeking AI experts to integrate this transformative technology into their operations. Data from the Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) Research Institute has highlighted a tenfold increase in weekly search queries related to generative AI from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023. Interestingly, contrary to fears of job displacement, AI adoption is driving an increase in demand for both freelancers and full-time employees, as businesses recognize the need for skilled professionals.

McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of current work hours across different sectors could be automated, thanks to AI development. This automation of repetitive tasks allows workers to focus on higher-value activities, driving productivity and promoting innovation across industries. To read more about AI creating jobs, see the Jobs AI Will Create.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile concerns persist regarding the potential threat of AI to certain roles, proactive measures can mitigate such risks. Workers in fields susceptible to automation can embrace AI tools to enhance their skill sets and remain relevant in the evolving job market. By capitalizing on AI-powered analytics and automation, individuals can augment their capabilities, drive efficiencies, and adapt to the changing demands of their professions, ensuring continued career growth and resilience in the face of technological disruption.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the rise of generative AI has spotlighted the dominance of the San Francisco Bay Area in the tech industry. According to a report by the Brookings Institution, of the approximately 2,200 generative AI job postings in the last year across 380 US metro areas, a quarter were in the Bay Area. This concentration of opportunities suggests a \"winner take most\" scenario, further solidifying the region's hold on technology. It is worth highlighting that the US is also known to be the country that has the most jobs for AI.\n\nWhile the prominence of San Francisco and San Jose in the tech industry may not come as a surprise, the Brookings report challenges the idea that smaller tech hubs like Austin or Miami could emerge as contenders. Instead, it suggests that the Bay Area's influence could strengthen. With the majority of investment and top startups in generative AI located in Silicon Valley, the region remains the epicenter of technological innovation.

With an additional $2.75 billion injection, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s total investment in Anthropic now stands at $4 billion.\n\nCollaboration between Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Anthropic extends beyond financial investment to technology development. Anthropic will capitalize on AWS as its primary cloud provider and utilize Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s custom chips to build, train, and deploy AI models. Furthermore, AWS customers, predominantly businesses, will gain access to Anthropic's AI models through Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s service, Bedrock. Interestingly, companies like Delta Air Lines and Siemens are already utilizing Bedrock to access Anthropic's AI capabilities, highlighting the practical applications and demand for AI solutions in various industries.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s investment in Anthropic aligns with the overall tech industry, where major players are actively investing in AI startups. This trend reflects growing public and business interest in AI technologies and their potential to drive innovation across sectors.\n\nOn the other hand, with an aim to address the global AI skills gap, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) has planned on training two million learners in artificial intelligence by the end of 2026, with a specific focus on underrepresented communities.

To achieve this ambitious goal, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is expanding its collaborations with universities globally and partnering with NGOs to deliver AI training to adult learners.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has $159 Billion Invested in These 8 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in April 2023 that artificial intelligence (AI) was \"extraordinary.\" However, Buffett quickly added that he didn't \"know if it's beneficial.\"\n\nWhatever the multibillionaire's opinion of AI is, he has already benefited financially from the technology. Buffett has invested $159 billion in these eight AI stocks -- and most of them have been big winners over the last 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest AI holding for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the tech giant is worth roughly $156.9 billion. The stock hasn't performed especially well over the last 12 months, though, due to sluggish sales growth.\n\nThat could change soon. Apple is widely expected to unveil its AI strategy at its developer conference and announce new AI functionality for iPhones in June.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire owns $1.8 billion in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. Although Buffett didn't make the original decision to buy the e-commerce and cloud services leader, he's expressed regret for not buying the stock earlier.\n\nAmazon has long been a pioneer in AI, reaping substantial efficiency gains from the technology. The ongoing surge in the adoption of generative AI should provide a big tailwind for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nIs Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) a Buffett AI stock? Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire's regulatory filings, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Berkshire subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) has a stake in Microsoft worth $11.6 million.\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its product lineup. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also enjoying strong growth as customers scramble to build and deploy AI apps.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBuffett also owns shares of Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) thanks to NEAM. The investment firm's position in Broadcom was valued at over $9.5 million at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom is a leading provider of custom AI accelerators and networking software used to scale AI applications. Its new XPU accelerator could claim the record as the biggest chip ever built for a consumer AI company.\n\n5. NXP Semiconductors\n\nNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is another AI chipmaker in NEAM's portfolio (which makes it a Buffett stock, albeit indirectly). NEAM owns a stake of $8.9 million in NXP.\n\nAI is everywhere these days -- and that's good for NXP. The company focuses on chips for the automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and communications infrastructure markets.\n\n6. Qualcomm\n\nThrough NEAM, Buffett has a position worth $8.3 million in Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM). Although Qualcomm hasn't delivered the sizzling gains over the last 12 months that some AI stocks owned by Buffett have, it's still up over 35%.\n\nQualcomm is best known for its technology, which is used in mobile phones. The company is also investing heavily in AI and recently teamed up with several other top tech companies to develop open-source software that allows AI apps to run on any chip.\n\n7. IBM\n\nBerkshire Hathaway once directly owned shares of IBM(NYSE: IBM) but no longer does. However, the tech pioneer remains a Buffett stock due to NEAM's $5 million stake in IBM.\n\nIBM might not be viewed as much of an AI leader now as it once was. The company's Watson platform, though, is used by many companies to harness the power of AI.\n\n8. Alphabet\n\nBuffett admitted publicly a few years ago that he made a mistake by not investing in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) earlier. While the tech giant still isn't in Berkshire's portfolio, NEAM owns around $2.5 million worth of Alphabet's shares.\n\nAlphabet has had a couple of public relations embarrassments with its AI efforts. But the company remains one of the leaders in AI development. It's also rumored to be in negotiations with Apple about integrating the Google Gemini AI models with iPhones.\n\nAre these Buffett AI stocks good picks to buy now?\n\nI think that all of these Buffett AI stocks could deliver solid long-term returns. Which are the best picks? I like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In my view, AI will primarily run in the cloud. These three companies operate the largest cloud platforms and should continue to be big winners for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Thursday, March 28, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Walmart Inc. (WMT), Linde plc (LIN) and IBM Corp. (IBM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nWalmart\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (+28.1% vs. +26.9%). The company is gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats.\n\nWalmart has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nThe strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled Walmart\u2019s fourth-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\r\n\r\nHowever, the retail landscape continues to be dynamic due to challenges like inflation and volatile consumer spending. High SG&A expenses are also a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+35.0% vs. +30.9%). The company has an extensive range of industrial gas applications that are enhancing global productivity day by day. The company supplies a wide range of gases crucial for various sectors like energy, steel, healthcare, manufacturing and electronics.\r\n\r\nLinde has long-term contracts with on-site customers, backed by minimum purchase requirements, ensuring stable cash flows. Linde\u2019s substantial backlog ensures future earnings potential. The merger of Praxair and Linde has positioned the firm as an efficient player in the profitable industrial gas market, with a considerable size advantage.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising competition for new projects in emerging markets raises concerns. The decrease in U.S. industrial production is also expected to reduce the demand for industrial gases, affecting profits. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>)\r\n\r\nIBM\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+53.9% vs. +42.9%). The company is poised to witness a healthy growth momentum driven by an optimum combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and steady R&D investments.\r\n\r\nHigher demand for hybrid cloud, AI solutions and increased watsonx adoption by clients are tailwinds. IBM\u2019s collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow generation provides the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks. In addition, buyouts have negatively impacted the company\u2019s balance sheet in the form of high levels of goodwill and net intangible assets. Foreign exchange volatility remains another concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Deere & Co. (DE), The Cigna Group (CI) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Kodak Pension Riches Point to $137 Billion Opportunity",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Inside Eastman Kodak Co., the once-iconic camera maker, a small pension investment team reaped such large gains in recent years that they windfalled themselves out of a job.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla\u2019s $25,000 Car Means Tossing Out the 100-Year-Old Assembly Line Bankman-Fried Is Sentenced to 25 Years in Prison Over FTX Collapse Dubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy Russians London Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth Billions UBS Banker\u2019s Frustration Exposes Cracks in World of Climate Finance\n\nThe group, managing a pool of retirement assets for more than 37,000 people, poured money into hedge funds and private equity and, in seven years, turned a $255 million deficit into a $1.1 billion surplus.\n\nThat represents a potential fortune for a company that spent the past decade stumbling to find a post-bankruptcy direction, lurching from crypto to Covid vaccines and back to a niche resurgence in film. Earlier this month, Kodak said it was moving management of the pension to an outside firm while it weighed how best to utilize the extra assets, which amount to almost triple the company\u2019s market value.\n\nThe photography pioneer isn\u2019t alone.\n\nAcross corporate America, buoyant markets and rising rates have turned a subset of employee pensions \u2014 defined-benefit plans \u2014 from a costly legacy of past promises into an unexpected nest egg.\n\nThe question now is how to tap it: a complex dilemma that\u2019s shaping merger talks and corporate strategy, while attracting insurers and asset managers who see a lucrative opportunity in companies that want out of this volatile game altogether.\n\n\u201cThis is the pension opportunity of a lifetime,\u201d said Scott Jarboe, a partner at consulting firm Mercer. \u201cPension plans are better funded than ever.\u201d\n\nCompanies with defined-benefit pensions in the S&P 1500 Composite Index \u2014 including household names such as Coca-Cola Co., Kraft Heinz Co. and Johnson & Johnson \u2014 were sitting on a combined $137 billion surplus as of Feb. 29, according to Mercer. In late 2016, they had a deficit of more than $500 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe flush status of these frozen legacy plans starkly contrasts with the chronic shortfalls at public pensions that are meant to cover retirement costs for hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters and police officers, among other government employees. Corporate US workers now mostly save for retirement through 401(k) plans that remove retirement responsibility from employers. Those plans don\u2019t have the fixed benefits for retirees that previous offerings did.\n\nFor most people, it has been \u201ca shift from financial certainty to financial uncertainty,\u201d BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said this week in his annual letter to investors. He warned of a retirement crisis facing the US. Even for the generous defined-benefit plans, it\u2019s unlikely that the surplus riches will simply be handed over to retirees. Firms are more likely to use the extra cash for corporate purposes.\n\nUsing the surplus isn\u2019t straightforward, but strategies for dealing with it could mean more business flowing to pension consultants and financial firms like Mercer, a unit of Marsh McLennan, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In the US, these pension plans represent a $2.5 trillion pool of assets that insurers and asset managers are eyeing as a fruitful source of revenue.\n\nSimply taking the cash earmarked for retirees to use on other expenses comes at a high cost: a 50% federal tax that can balloon to as much as 90% when factoring in state and local levies.\n\n\u201cCould a corporate take the money out to pay for share buybacks?\u201d said Michael Moran, a senior pensions strategist at Goldman Sachs. \u201cYou could, but you pay a huge tax, so it doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d\n\nQuickTake: Why Slow-Burn Pension Crisis Is Getting Harder to Fix\n\nCompanies can avoid taxes if they use part or all of the surplus to increase benefits for the retirees in the pension plan. They can also transfer the surplus into a new plan that includes beneficiaries from the old one. Both options don\u2019t leave much for the employer to use.\n\nA more strategic route is actively cultivating the surplus and leveraging it as an M&A tool. Several firms are considering using their surpluses to help mitigate costs in a potential acquisition for a target company with an underfunded plan. Firms are allowed to merge plans, which can unlock the trapped surplus in one to fund the other.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. decided to combine a pension plan with a $3.6 billion surplus with another to use the surplus to offset the roughly $550 million it paid annually to that plan. That means IBM won\u2019t have to make another cash contribution for five to 10 years, saving on its pension costs and freeing it to use the money for other corporate purposes.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies are dusting off their pension plans and looking at what can be done,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Moran said. \u201cEspecially what to do with the trapped surplus. This is something they haven\u2019t had to do since before the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nRead More: Kodak Explores Tapping Pension Fund\u2019s $1.2 Billion Surplus\n\nSurpluses also give companies the chance to use the extra cash to pay for an otherwise costly and complex transaction that offloads the pension from the balance sheet to an insurer, which takes over the assets and the responsibility of payments to the retirees. In industry parlance, this is called a pension risk transfer.\n\nOften, the first step before a risk transfer is similar to Kodak\u2019s: Engage a money manager to take over investment of the assets and determine the best way forward.\n\nThese third-party firms, dubbed outsourced chief investment offices, or OCIOs, are usually part of financial companies or pension consultants. Companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on managing plans, including costs for human resources, paying investment managers and covering skyrocketing mandatory fees to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the US agency that backstops private sector retirement funds.\n\n\u201cThat lends itself to a rationale for the company deciding to go the OCIO route or to an insurer,\u201d said Sean Brennan, head of the pension risk transfer business at Apollo Global Management Inc.\u2019s Athene insurance arm.\n\nIt also means executives can focus solely on their core businesses rather than also devoting time and attention to running a mini-asset management firm from within.\n\nThe popularity of getting rid of the plans is seen in the increasing size of deals in recent years for external money-management mandates. The industry\u2019s assets are expected to grow more than 10% annually over the next five years, according to consulting firm Cerulli Associates.\n\nThe biggest providers of outsourced management globally are Mercer, with approximately $420 billion of assets, BlackRock ($400 billion) and Russell Investments ($375 billion).\n\nGoldman Sachs, which manages about $250 billion, won a blockbuster mandate of roughly \u00a323 billion ($29 billion) from BAE Systems Plc\u2019s pension plan in September. Goldman, Mercer and other firms specialize in helping companies continue to invest the portfolio assets and can help broker the types of risk transfer deals to insurers that Kodak is likely considering and that many others have done with increasing frequency.\n\nActivity reached a 10-year high of $48.3 billion in risk transfer deals in 2022 and $29 billion by the third quarter of last year, according to Goldman\u2019s annual corporate pension study. This year is off to a strong start with several multibillion-dollar transactions, including two for UK insurer Prudential: Shell Plc\u2019s $4.9 billion plan for its US retirees and Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s $5.9 billion plan covering 56,000 retirees.\n\nA majority of US companies with surplus plans are expected to do pension risk transfers in the next year or two.\n\n\u201cWith a surplus, there\u2019s less of a chance a company needs to pay cash to top up the cost of the deal,\u201d Athene\u2019s Brennan said. \u201cDoing a pension risk transfer is the ultimate de-risking.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX\u2019s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving The Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet\u2019s Favorite Wok Eclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\n16.

        "title": "The AI Underdogs: 3 Stocks That Should Be Getting More Love",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence, the usual suspects for AI stocks comes up. Clearly, going with these winners has not been a bad idea. However, investors that are just tuning into this opportunity may want to consider lesser-appreciated ideas.\n\nA primary concern is that the top-tier AI stocks feature rich multiples, whether against sales, earnings or some other metric. To be fair, with such a vast opportunity, it\u2019s difficult to determine valuation. What seems like an overvalued play could indeed be a discounted prospect.\n\nNevertheless, there are quite a few compelling enterprises that just aren\u2019t getting the spotlight. The argument here is that they should. So, without further delay, below are intriguing ideas for AI stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWith discussions about digital intelligence, IBM (NYSE:IBM) tends to be an afterthought. That\u2019s not meant to be a pejorative against the company known as Big Blue. It\u2019s just that the legacy tech firm has been slow to adapt to various changes in the tech ecosystem, such as cloud computing. However, with IBM\u2019s aggressive (if not audacious) plan to replace nearly 8,000 jobs with AI, it\u2019s one of the top names to consider.\n\nOther companies talk a good game when it comes to generative AI. However, if Big Blue is successful in replacing human workers with machines, it would achieve an unprecedented level of productivity acceleration. Obviously, humans have this pesky tendency of demanding things like salaries and civil rights. With machines, you don\u2019t deal with any of these \u201cunproductive\u201d issues.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to dismiss the results so far. Last fiscal year, the company beat bottom-line targets four times out of four. The average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.58%. For the current fiscal year, analysts see revenue of $58.69 billion. That would be up 3.1% from last year\u2019s print of $56.94 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombined with IBM\u2019s forward yield of 3.48%, it\u2019s one of the underappreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you hear the name Walmart (NYSE:WMT), you immediately think about retail and discounts. Chances are, you\u2019re not really looking at WMT stock as an AI play. However, the company\u2019s leadership team would like to shift this paradigm. Per its website, the big-box retailer is leveraging generative AI to give time back to households for more important endeavors.\n\nUnder a typical search protocol, a customer may go to a retailer\u2019s e-commerce platform and look for items to buy. However, knowing what you want requires some planning. And planning takes time. That can accrue to wasted hours during the week that can be spent on more important matters. Therefore, Walmart has integrated a large language model to provide smart recommendations to their customers.\n\nStated differently, Walmart aims to take away the pain point of the planning process and just get right down to product recommendations. That\u2019s a win for the customer and a win for Walmart. Moving forward, analysts see the company hitting just under $620 billion in sales for fiscal 2025. That should be more than doable.\n\nPlus, you\u2019re looking at a solid retail business that pays dividends. Therefore, WMT ranks among the hidden-gem AI stocks.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nFor tech-centric AI stocks, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is notable because it really hasn\u2019t received much love at all. While other tech firms have seen nothing but green ink over the past 52 weeks, BIDU stock is deep in the red. For full disclosure, lingering questions about the viability of China\u2019s economy has sidelined Baidu and other Chinese tech firms. Still, BIDU makes for a tempting source of speculation.\n\nHowever, the underperformance might not last indefinitely. Last week, consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) held preliminary talks with Baidu about using the Chinese firm\u2019s generative AI technology in its devices in China. Unique regulations within the world\u2019s second-largest economy has somewhat forced Apple to consider a local AI partner. Cynically, that\u2019s great news for Baidu shareholders.\n\nBased on past financial performances, it almost seems a matter of time before BIDU stock really soars. In the past four quarters, Baidu\u2019s positive earnings surprise came out to just under 27%. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe that revenue will reach $20.08 billion. If so, that would be up 7.8% against last year\u2019s print of $18.62 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With the equities market seemingly soaring to one plateau after another, bringing up dividend aristocrat stocks seems overly cautious. These ideas represent companies that have increased their payout annually for at least 25 years. By nature, this is a cautious play but it\u2019s never a bad idea to exercise some prudence.\n\nLook, no one\u2019s saying that investors should hit the panic button and not believe the incredible resilience the equities space has demonstrated. However, it\u2019s also true that the smart money is diversifying its exposure. Recently, we saw a record outflow away from tech stocks. At the same time, there have been major moves into investment-grade bonds.\n\nAgain, this dynamic alone doesn\u2019t justify a panicked response. However, after such a searing ride in the innovation space, it makes sense to spread some of the profits around. With that in mind, below are dividend aristocrat stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a big-box retailer that truly offers a one-stop shopping experience, Target (NYSE:TGT) arguably makes an excellent case for dividend aristocrat stocks. People need their stuff and while e-commerce is popular, sometimes, folks need their stuff right away. Target can accommodate. And you know what it\u2019s also accommodating? A forward dividend yield of 2.61%.\n\nNotably, the company has been increasing its payouts annually for the past 53 years. So, it\u2019s not just one of the dividend aristocrat stocks \u2013 it\u2019s a dividend king. Further, the payout ratio is relatively low at 41.74%. Therefore, investors won\u2019t have to toss and turn at night regarding yield sustainability. Target more than likely has your back.\n\nPer data from Yahoo Finance, I\u2019m digging the recent financial performances. In the past four quarters, the retailer has exceeded expectations for earnings per share. The average positive earnings surprise came out to a very robust 28%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year (2025), analysts believe Target will post EPS of $9.40. That would be an improvement over last year\u2019s print of $8.94.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA healthcare giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with last year\u2019s spinoff of its consumer health products division now focuses on pharmaceuticals and medical technology. Subsequently, the renewed and sharpened focus could serve JNJ well. Currently, J&J ranks among the favorites for dividend aristocrat stocks and I don\u2019t expect much to change moving forward.\n\nRight now, it posts a solid forward dividend yield of 3.07%. That\u2019s well above the healthcare sector\u2019s average yield of 1.58%. Notably, the company enjoys 62 years of annual payout increases. Along with a payout ratio of 43.31%, stakeholders can rest easy at night. This is passive income you can trust.\n\nTo be fair, the company had some shaky earnings performances last year. In the first and second quarters, J&J missed its EPS target, albeit by an average of 3%. However, management began righting the ship in the second half. During this period, the average positive earnings surprise landed at exactly 3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate that EPS will clock in at $10.65. That would be a solid improvement over last year\u2019s print of $9.92.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nA soft drink and beverages giant, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) represents one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks thanks to its enormous brand presence. Moving forward, it should also benefit from the trade-down effect as a cheap provider of caffeinated beverages. As for the topic of this article, Coca-Cola offers a forward dividend yield of 3.04%.\n\nConspicuously, this passive income runs higher than the consumer staple sector\u2019s average yield of 1.89%. Granted, the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 61.34%, though it\u2019s not by any means terrible. Further, Coca-Cola has been increasing its payout annually over the past 63 years. There\u2019s just practically zero chance that management will give up this lofty record without a serious fight.\n\nEven better, it\u2019s not merely a dividend queen as its financial performance from last year demonstrated. The \u201cworst\u201d print arrived in Q4, when the company met its EPS target of 45 cents. Overall, in the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came in at 5.23%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts project that EPS will land at $2.59. That\u2019s a decent improvement over fiscal 2023\u2019s result of $2.48.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it: renewable energy specialist NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has had a rough performance over the past 52 weeks. Still, in recent sessions, the bulls have started to find their footing. Over the long run, the red ink could be a discounted idea. After all, renewables won\u2019t be going away anytime soon. Fundamentally, then, NEE ranks among the compelling dividend aristocrat stocks.\n\nAs for the print itself, investors can treat themselves to a forward yield of 3.03%. Yes, that\u2019s a bit lower than the utility sector\u2019s average yield of 3.75%. However, because we\u2019re dealing with a burgeoning market, this appears a trustworthy source of passive income. The payout ratio is very much acceptable at 56%. Also, the company commands 30 years of payout increases.\n\nAlso, last year\u2019s financial performances were above expectations in terms of the bottom line. In the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 9.53%. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe that per-share profits will hit $3.40. That would be a solid run from 2023\u2019s result of $3.17.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nI\u2019m going to be talking about IBM (NYSE:IBM) all day. While so many enterprises have made such a big fuss about integrating artificial intelligence, Big Blue is truly putting its money where its mouth is. Last year, management expressed its intentions to replace thousands of its (human) workers with AI. You can\u2019t accelerate productivity better than that.\n\nEven better, while you\u2019re waiting for this narrative to pan out, you can enjoy a forward dividend yield of 3.48%. That\u2019s well above the tech sectors average yield of 1.37%. Sure, the payout ratio is toward the elevated side at 62.28%. Nevertheless, the company enjoys a track record of 28 years of rising payouts. You can probably sleep easy on this one.\n\nAlso, while Big Blue hasn\u2019t exactly lit up the board, it\u2019s been a steady hand last year. Over the past four quarters, the company generated a positive earnings surprise of 5.58%. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe EPS will hit $9.29. That\u2019s up noticeably from last year\u2019s print of $8.85.\n\nEssex Property Trust (ESS) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nStructured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Essex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) acquires, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily residential properties in select west coast markets in the U.S. Per its public profile, the REIT has ownership interest in 252 apartment communities comprising approximately 62,000 apartment homes. Fundamentally, ESS ranks among the tempting dividend aristocrat stocks because we all have to live somewhere.\n\nAs for the passive income, Essex is quite generous, offering a forward dividend yield of 4.05%. To be fair, the payout ratio is steep at 170.15%. That\u2019s obviously a risk factor to consider. Nevertheless, REITs generally tend to run a higher-than-average payout ratio compared to non-trust entities. Also, with a track record of 30 years of consecutive payout increases, Essex is hardly a fly-by-night operation.\n\nStill, in exchange for the higher payout, investors must absorb a greater risk profile. In particular, the RETI\u2019s Q4 earnings report was ugly, delivering EPS of $1.02 against an expected target of $1.46. Further, analysts are looking at per-share profits of $5.32 this year, below the $6.32 posted in 2023.\n\nHowever, the overriding relevance of the business could be enough to seal the deal. It\u2019s an idea to watch.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a hydrocarbon energy giant, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) carries some questions regarding its future viability. With so much emphasis placed on green and renewable energy solutions, entities like Chevron appear to be on borrowed time. Then again, very few resources feature the same energy density as fossil fuels. Plus, the world still runs on oil, making CVX a worthwhile idea for dividend aristocrat stocks.\n\nPresently, Chevron offers a forward yield of 4.22%. That\u2019s just under the energy sector\u2019s average yield of 4.24%. However, other factors play very much into CVX stock\u2019s favor. For one thing, the payout ratio is relatively low at 45.28%, inspiring confidence regarding yield sustainability. More importantly, the company features a track record of 37 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nOverall, if you took away the clunker of an earnings performance in Q3, Chevron has more then held its own. Excepting Q3, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.1%. For the current fiscal year, the average EPS target calls for $12.62, which is below last year\u2019s print of $13.13.\n\nHowever, the high-side estimate calls for $14.55. That might not be unreasonable given current geopolitical dynamics, making CVX an intriguing upside opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) ended the recent trading session at $188.79, demonstrating a -1.07% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.31% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.41%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.27%.\n\nThe technology and consulting company's shares have seen an increase of 2.76% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.86% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.05%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of IBM in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.59, marking a 16.91% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $14.56 billion, indicating a 2.18% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.07 per share and revenue of $63.79 billion, which would represent changes of +4.68% and +3.12%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% higher. At present, IBM boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at valuation, IBM is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.96. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.25.\n\nWe can additionally observe that IBM currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. IBM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.57 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 156, putting it in the bottom 39% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "content": "It\u2019s been almost a year since AI\u2019s bloom last spring, recalling another flowering: The \u201ctulip mania\u201d of the Dutch Golden Age, one of the most infamous examples of a financial bubble in economic history. But will ChatGPT blossom, with ramifications for any worker\u2019s job, or will it wither as the petals fall off the proverbial plant?\n\nEven if people are mixed on whether AI will take your job or enhance it, one thing is becoming clear: Managers are starting to pit these innovations against disenfranchised workers.\n\nLook no further than IBM, whose shares have soared by nearly 17% since the beginning of the year\u2014a boon attributed in part to the company\u2019s adoption of AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been open about the fact that many jobs at IBM can be partially or completely replaced by AI, even writing in an April commentary piece for Fortune that he had used AI to reduce the number of employees working on relatively manual HR-related work to about 50 from 700 previously, which allowed the company to focus on other things.\n\nBut Krishna is a bit mixed on the topic, having flip-flopped from saying certain roles would be replaced by AI to declaring that AI will generate more jobs than it eliminates. That\u2019s all to say, the jury is out on how the decision-makers will eventually greet and implement AI.\n\nHowever, bosses are considering following IBM\u2019s lead, a massive survey suggests: A whopping 41% of managers say they\u2019re hoping to replace workers with cheaper AI products this year, according to a survey of 3,000 managers by software company beautiful.ai.\n\nThe report comes amid a groundswell of worker rage and instability. Employees haven\u2019t felt this poorly about their jobs since this pandemic first hit, according to a survey from BambooHR. Struggling to make ends meet, many Americans have turned sour on the workforce and reported a loss in faith in almost every profession in the most recent Gallup Honesty and Ethics poll.\n\nWage growth has recently outpaced inflation, though after years of volatility it makes sense that many households aren\u2019t feeling that data necessarily hit their wallets. While union popularity recently surged (amid UAW success stories and research regarding the financial impact of a union), membership is still at a record low after decades of decline. The struggle for greater pay and a livable wage is evident in the \"hot labor summer,\" as strike activity increased by 280% in just this past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it seems as if some managers' heads are being turned when the question becomes whether to give out a raise or hire a robot. In the new survey, almost half of managers (48%) reported that their companies would profit from replacing swaths of human workers with tools.\u00a0And 45% said they saw these innovations as a chance to \u201clower salaries of employees because less human-powered work is needed.\u201d\n\nAre managers going sci-fi, or bystanders to the AI surge?\n\nOf course there was a wave of paranoia when AI first began to go through its growth spurt in 2023. Rapid improvement and evolution caused many to shift in their seats as 61% of Americans believed new products could threaten civilization, per a Reuters/Ipsos survey.\n\nAs knee-jerk reactions to AI faded over the course of the year, new theories cropped up about AI\u2019s trajectory. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t replace you, but a human who could use AI better than you might,\u201d became a popular take. Some suggested your danger of losing a job depending on your sector, level of seniority, or location of work. And junior workers, by nature of vulnerability, reported the greatest fear of losing their jobs to AI. Many employees look to learn more about the beast they fear (it\u2019s the devil\u2014or generative AI\u2014you know), as 79% reported they wanted training in the area to consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\n\nConsider Noah Smith, the influential economic writer who left his perch at Bloomberg Opinion to launch his own Substack, and Niall Ferguson, the Scottish economic historian who has held perches at Stanford and Harvard (as well as Bloomberg Opinion). They recently weighed in with their versions of the doomer vs. accelerationist debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that regular humans will have plentiful, high-paying jobs in the age of A.I. dominance\u2014often doing much the same kind of work that they\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Smith wrote on his Substack, prompting agreement and debate from a range of leading economists who talked to the New York Times\u2019 Peter Coy. Ferguson had cold water to throw on this, saying, \u201c\u2026recent evidence about labor market shocks from automation and international trade suggests that the negative impacts of AI will be geographically and demographically concentrated, and labor markets in the hardest-hit places will not adapt smoothly.\u201d\n\nEven so, after investors have poured billions into AI, triggering comparisons to the stock market of the mid- or late-90s, Rana Foroohar of the Financial Times cautions we might be getting ahead of ourselves. Cautioning against the \u201cinevitability\u201d of AI changing the world, upending our jobs, or boosting productivity, she warns we are still at the early stage of innovation, and this will take decades to play out\u2014and, of course, that the bubble could soon burst.\n\nWe\u2019re in new territory, or shaky ground, if you take the experts' mixed predictions for it. It all means managers likely don\u2019t have the AI leverage they think they do to quash a potential worker uprising (if that\u2019s what they wanted). And even if they did, managers might be better off worrying for their own roles. Those at the top might be more exposed to AI invasion, though by nature of making executive decisions are likely shielded from true vulnerability. And 48% of managers posited that AI tools were a threat to their salaries and will lead to wage declines throughout the workforce this year. Even more (50%) reported fear their management position would experience a dock in pay related to AI.\n\nBut most managers aren\u2019t actually looking to have a fully robotic workforce. Rather, 66% of managers are looking to use AI tools to enhance their employees\u2019 productivity. Only 12% of bosses said they\u2019re using AI with the purpose of downsizing or spending less on their workforce. So managers might be bluffing or simply weighing their options right now.\n\n\u201cAI may not replace managers, but the managers that use AI will replace the managers that do not,\u201d IBM\u2019s chief commercial officer Rob Thomas said in a conference, according to TechCrunch. \u201cIt really does change how people work.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "12 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best data center stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the data center industry, which is one of the hottest in the world right now, then you can skip ahead to take a look at the 5 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were expecting at the start of the fourth quarter of 2021. Back then, the Federal Reserve had yet to start to raise interest rates, even though some voices on Wall Street were raising alarm bells about the effects of the monetary policy and stimulus packages in the era of COVID-19 lock downs. High rates naturally do not bode well for high growth sectors, and technology stocks big and small had a rough time on the market the next year particularly as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global food and energy markets and spurred multi year high inflation levels which made some question whether consecutive 75 basis point hikes by the Federal Reserve were still a bit low.\n\nNow, with the first quarter of 2024 coming to an end, the stock market is a fundamentally changed environment due to the rise of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA has shown to be the hottest artificial intelligence stock on Wall Street, and at its heart is the multi-billion global data center industry. While most people experience the user side of AI, at its heart, the technology is part of a broader set of data analysis techniques such as machine learning.\n\nWhether it's AI or ML, both require copious amounts of data to spearhead leading edge applications in high technology industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Processing and storing this data requires considerable data center facilities, which are large scale computing houses that 'host' equipment such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and storage modules.\n\nA variety of firms cater to the needs of the global data center industry. Some of the best known in this area are data center hardware manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). On the software side, firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) provide businesses with software environments to generate meaningful insights from their data.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, to analyze the performance of data center stocks, one can either see how individual firms such as the equities listed above are performing or track a collection of stocks called an exchange traded fund (ETF). Most popular data center ETFs also include real estate investment trusts (ETFs) due to the sizeable real estate requirements of operating and owning data centers. One such ETF is the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF. Its six month, 12 month, and 36 month year returns sit at 14.5%, 22.27%, and 2.10%, respectively. As expected, the ETF's annual returns in 2022 were negative, as the broader technology sector took a beating.\n\nFinally, one stock that helps keep track of the broader data center industry might be faring is Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR). Here's what Baron Funds had to say about this particular stock in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nFollowing strong share performance, we trimmed our large investment in data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for the company.\n\nData center landlords such as Digital Realty (and Equinix, Inc.) are benefiting from record low vacancy, demand outpacing supply, more constrained power availability, and rising rental rates. Several secular demand vectors, which are currently broadening, are contributing to robust fundamentals for data center space globally. They include the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, increased cloud computing adoption, the ongoing growth in mobile data and internet traffic, and artificial intelligence as a new wave of data center demand.\n\nIn the last few months, we have also spent time with CEO Andy Power of Digital Realty. Over the last few years, Andy and Digital Realty\u2019s management team have been undergoing a business transformation, which accelerated after its acquisition of Interxion in March 2020, a pure-play European network-dense data center operator. The company has been shedding non-core slower-growth assets, investing and expanding in Europe, growing its retail colocation business, improving its balance sheet, and adding operational expertise by supplementing new management leadership. We have spent a significant amount of time with Andy over the years and believe the investments the company has made are on the cusp of bearing fruit and will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, we believe the fundamentals in its core business are at an inflection point with robust demand/bookings, pricing power, hyperscale cloud players outsourcing a higher percentage of their digital infrastructure needs and limited competitive capacity. We believe these factors will lead to growth in the core business in the next few years and are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the company.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some undervalued and best data center stocks according to analysts. A couple that top the list are VNET Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET), IHS Holding Limited (NYSE:IHS), and Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD). 12 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nThe silhouette of a data center facility in the sunset, illustrating the companies focus on data center solutions.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best data center stocks according to analysts, we ranked the data center related constituents of the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF by the average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked those with the highest upside.\n\nFor these undervalued data center stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Nanotechnology involves tweaking matter at a molecular scale, and when things get smaller, they have a greater surface area than their size, impacting their behavior. That\u2019s all a bit too technical, though, and all that\u2019s relevant is that nanotechnology stocks could potentially blow up in line with the evolution of tech.\n\nMoreover, nanotech blends incredibly well with AI, which could be massive for the tech space and related stocks. For instance, nanotech could potentially scale down the size of AI systems and make them more efficient, while AI could help improve nanotech designs. The endless possibilities add to the allure of nanotech stocks to buy.\n\nNanotechnology Stocks To Buy: Analog Devices (ADI) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnalog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a top semiconductor company investing heavily in nanotechnology. It boasts a massive revenue base near $11.57 billion while rewarding its shareholders with a growing dividend each year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s gotten deeply involved with nanotechnology and has recently offered several products that benefit from nanoscale engineering. Moreover, it produces specific nanotech products such as the nanoDAC (Digital-to-Analog Converters) series, shedding light on the powerful impact of miniaturization. Additionally, its product range extends beyond the nanoDAC range, including amplifiers, data converters, and whatnot.\n\nFurthermore, ADI\u2019s founding role in MIT.nano, a leading research lab dedicated to nanoscience, reflects its leadership stance in the sector. However, investing in ADI isn\u2019t cheap, but Tipranks\u2019 analysts assign a 10% upside from current prices. Moreover, it comes with a solid dividend growing\u00a0for the past 20 years.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a leading pick-and-shovel play in the semiconductor space. Over the years, it has become a juggernaut in materials engineering, growing its revenues from $9.66 billion in 2016 to $26.5 billion last year. Moreover, it posted a record free cash flow figure of $7.6 billion, which bodes remarkably well for its shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilar to ADI, AMAT is looking to take things up a notch or two with nanotech. It has committed billions of dollars for its innovation infrastructure to expand its capacity efficiently through 2030. The Maydan Technology Center is a testament to that blueprint and the Materials Engineering Technology Accelerator (META), which aims to take nanotech to the next level. Moreover, with MIT, AMAT disbursed a grant of roughly $40 million to advance nano-fabrication equipment and competencies to MIT.nano.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has spearheaded tech advancements across multiple fields, and nanotechnology is no different. In fact, Big Blue has been involved in miniaturizing technology since the 80s, with the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope. The invention led to nanometer-scale silicon transistors, which proved critical to the development of microelectronics space. These inventions effectively laid the groundwork for modern-day nanotechnology, positioning IBM as a major stakeholder in the sector\u2019s expansion.\n\nFast-forward to 2023, its contribution to the sector is shown through its partnership with\u00a0Micron (NASDAQ:MU)\u00a0in a $10 billion chip research program in Albany. This ground-breaking collaboration is supported by a hefty $1 billion investment from New York State in developing a NanoFab Reflection facility and equipping it with a trailblazing ASML lithography machine.\n\nHence, IBM looks to continue pushing the boundaries of chip manufacturing while reinforcing its position in tech. On a side note, its financial performance has been impressive lately, marked by two consecutive quarters of revenue and earnings beats. Moreover, its stock has been up a healthy 30% in the past six months due to its strong quarterlies and investments in AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Time to Buy Chipotle (CMG) or IBM's (IBM) Stock for Higher Highs?",
        "content": "Two large-cap stocks that may be catching investors' attention are Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG and IBM IBM as both have been on the cusp of reaching higher highs.\n\nDriven by a remarkable turnaround in its sales growth IBM shares hit 52-week highs of $199.18 last Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chipotle\u2019s continued expansion has been magnified by the company planning a 50 to 1 stock split and hit peaks of over $3,000 a share today.\n\nHaving a dominant footprint in their respective industries, IBM has a market capitalization of $177.65 billion with Chipotle at $76.77 billion. That said, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy stock in either of these corporate titans as they continue to take market share in the computer-integrated systems and retail restaurant markets respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM\u2019s Renovation\n\nFormally known for its computer hardware products IBM\u2019s transformation to software applications including hybrid cloud and AI strategies has put an end to the tech giant's slowing sales growth. Furthermore, IBM\u2019s annual revenue of $60.53 billion spiked 5% last year marking the largest percentage increase since 2011. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM\u2019s total sales are projected to rise 3% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to edge up another 4% next year to $66.59 billion. More importantly, is that annual earnings are expected to be up 4% in FY24 and forecasted to pop another 5% in FY25 to $10.58 per share. It\u2019s also noteworthy that FY25 EPS projections would represent 33% growth over the last five years with IBM\u2019s bottom line edging closer to pre-pandemic levels of $12.81 per share in 2019. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChipotle\u2019s Stock Split\n\nUnprecedented growth has become Chipotle\u2019s trademark but a stock split has long been awaited to make its shares more affordable to retail investors. On Tuesday, Chipotle\u2019s board delivered and announced what will be one of the largest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history and is expected to take effect on Wednesday, June 26.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering its most recent closing price the 50-1 split would put CMG shares at around $58. With Chipotle\u2019s annual earnings projected to jump 18% this year to $53.11 per share this would be adjusted to roughly $1.06 a share post-split. Notably, Chipotle's EPS is currently forecasted to leap another 21% next year to $64.62 per share or $1.29 a share post-split. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Performance & Valuations\n\nYear to date Chipotle\u2019s stock has soared +27% while IBM shares have climbed +19% with both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s +8% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +9%. Over the last year, Chipotle\u2019s stock has now risen +78% with IBM up +54% to easily top the broader indexes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM still trades at a reasonable 19.2X forward earnings multiple which is below the S&P 500\u2019s 21.7X but slightly above its Zacks Computer-Integrtred Systems industry average of 18.2X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs for Chipotle, it has historically been able to command a premium due to its high growth margins and niche as a premium fast food leader. CMG currently trades at 52.6X forward earnings which is well below its decade-long high of 231.1X and closer to the median of 49.7X. However, it is important to remember that following its stock split CMG\u2019s P/E will likely be higher from its EPS being diluted. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the moment, Chipotle and IBM\u2019s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, longer-term investors may continue to be rewarded but there could be better buying opportunities ahead considering their very strong year to date rallies.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 best cities for cyber security jobs in the world. We have also discussed the growing demand in the field. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World.\n\nThe cybersecurity field is growing at an unprecedented scale as cybercrimes have increased by 300% since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This number is shedding light on the urgency of building strong defenses against online threats that has fuelled a 32% projected increase in cybersecurity jobs over the next decade. Presently, there are nearly 600,000 unfilled cybersecurity positions in the United States alone which confirms that there is an immense demand for skilled professionals in the industry.\n\nMoreover, the UK has also decided to double its investment in overseas cyber security projects, confirming the increasing seriousness of cyber threats. With an increase in spending to \u00a325mn ($32.02) in 2022-23, the government shows the understanding of the pressing need to fortify global digital defenses.\n\nDespite misconceptions about the field's exclusivity, cybersecurity offers high-paying opportunities without the need for a bachelor's degree. For example, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s initiative, Grow with Google, aims to address this gap by providing accessible online training in cybersecurity and other high-demand skills. With programs like these, individuals can acquire valuable certifications in as little as 3 months, setting them on a path to secure, well-compensated employment in cybersecurity.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that several specialized areas tend to offer lucrative compensation in the cyber security field due to their high demand and the level of expertise required. Among these, roles such as Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), security architects, and penetration testers often command the highest salaries.\n\nThe field of cybersecurity is not attractive solely because of the high salaries, in fact, the field also offers the flexibility of remote work and the satisfaction of combating digital threats across different sectors, including finance, healthcare, and government. Salaries in the field often exceed $100,000, with some remote positions offering upwards of $200,000 annually. Speaking of salaries, Virginia and California are the highest paying states for cyber security professionals, making them the best states for cyber security jobs. To read more about high-paying remote jobs, see the remote jobs that pay atleast $50 an hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2024, cybersecurity predictions point to an increase in AI-generated threats. Even though large language models have revolutionized organizational cybersecurity, limitations have made it necessary to shift towards specialized, smaller models. Threat actors are expected to exploit AI development through sophisticated phishing campaigns and deepfakes. Furthermore, according to the World Economic Forum, there's an anticipated spike in third-party data breaches, accentuated by a 72% increase observed in 2023. Consequently, organizations must fortify their cybersecurity posture by scrutinizing not only their practices but also those of their vendors.\n\nIn order to combat and raise awareness about the serious cyber threats, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched its cybersecurity research center in Tokyo on March 7, 2024, aiming to improve security in the Asia-Pacific region. Situated in Tokyo's Roppongi district, the center will engage in cybersecurity policy discussions, educational initiatives, resource development, and research collaborations with Japanese institutions. Covering 13 countries, it serves as an Asia-Pacific hub for (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s cybersecurity efforts. The initiative coincides with Japan's \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month,\" highlighting how the country is committed to enhancing online security. With rising cyber threats, including government-targeted attacks and incidents like the Port of Nagoya ransomware attack, Japan is also actively working on its efforts to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure and promote regional collaboration.\n\nOn the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) have announced an expanded strategic partnership aimed at enhancing clients' cybersecurity capabilities. This collaboration signifies the importance of unified efforts in tackling evolving security threats. With this partnership, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) aim to provide end-to-end security solutions to clients. Notably, the partnership will focus on two critical areas: modernizing security operations and securing cloud transformations.\n\nThis joint venture will essentially capitalize on advanced AI and automation technologies to provide clients with autonomous and advanced managed security operations. This includes 24x7 monitoring, investigation, and automated remediation of security alerts. Moreover, the partnership will facilitate clients' journey to the cloud by leveraging Prisma Cloud byPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) in conjunction with International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting services. 15 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World\n\nA high-rise office building, its staff busy at work providing cybersecurity services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best cities for cyber security jobs in the world, we first identified 15 countries with the highest salaries for cyber security jobs.

        "title": "12 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.\n\nMoreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as \"very important,\" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.\n\nCompanies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced \"new collar\" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree \u2014 the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.\n\nFurthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.\n\nAnother observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates. To read about unemployment rates, see the countries with the highest unemployment rates. 12 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College\n\nA student concentrate on their laptop in the library, taking advantage of an educational program online.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best alternatives to a 4-year college degree, we have looked at alternatives with 4 major traits. Firstly, we tried to include options that offered specialized training or are specific in nature. Secondly, we identified options that provided hand-on experience. Thirdly, we looked at degree alternatives that were largely accessible. Lastly, we selected alternatives that aligned with current industry demands and trends and hence, came with high employability chances. We tried to score each alternative out of a total of 40 on the basis of consensus about the presence of these traits. We utilized Reddit as our primary source of consensus. The list is presented in an ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12. Volunteer Work at Non Profit Organizations\n\nIM Score: 20\n\nVolunteer work at non-profit organizations offers practical, hands-on experience in real-world settings, fostering valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Unlike a four-year college degree, volunteering provides immediate engagement with societal issues, promoting empathy and social responsibility. It allows individuals to explore different career paths, gain insights into various industries, and network with professionals. Additionally, volunteering can lead to job opportunities and personal fulfillment without the financial burden of college tuition. It can also lead to inner sense of purpose and happiness. To read more about such jobs, see the happiest jobs in the world.\n\nVolunteering is also a great option if you are struggling to find a direction. It is also one of the best alternatives for college dropouts.\n\n11. Get an Associate Degree at a Community College\n\nIM Score: 21\n\nGetting an Associate Degree at a Community College offers several advantages over a 4-year college degree. Firstly, it's typically more affordable, allowing students to save money on tuition and fees. Additionally, community colleges often offer flexible schedules, making it easier for students to work while attending school or to balance other responsibilities. The smaller class sizes can provide more personalized attention and support. Associate degrees can also lead to some of the highest paying jobs as well.\n\n10. Start Freelancing\n\nIM Score: 22\n\nFreelancing offers flexibility, autonomy, and potentially higher income without the time and financial commitments of a four-year college degree. It allows individuals to capitalize on their skills immediately, gaining practical experience while networking and building a portfolio. Additionally, freelancing offers the opportunity to work on diverse projects, fostering continuous learning and skill development. With the rise of remote work and digital platforms, freelancers can access global opportunities, transcending geographical limitations. In exceptional cases, it is one of the easiest and high paying alternatives to a 4 year college degree.\n\n9. Get an Internship or an Entry Level Job\n\nIM Score: 24\n\nThis is one of the best options other than college after high school as choosing to pursue an internship or an entry-level job over a 4-year college degree can offer several advantages. The real-world experience can often be more immediately applicable to a career path than theoretical learning in a college setting. To read more about this, see the highest paying entry level jobs with no experience.\n\n8. Join Apprenticeship Programs\n\nIM Score: 26\n\nApprenticeship programs are one of the most popular alternatives to college degree as offer hands-on experience and specialized training, often tailored to specific industries, providing immediate applicability of skills. For instance, in fields like software development, apprenticeships such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s apprenticeship program offer direct mentorship from industry experts, real-world projects, and potential job placement.\n\n7. Get Microcredentials and Nanodegrees\n\nIM Score: 27\n\nMicrocredentials and Nanodegrees offer focused, specialized learning tailored to immediate industry needs, providing a quicker pathway to acquiring relevant skills compared to a traditional 4-year degree. For instance, in fields like Data Science, professionals may opt for a Nanodegree in Machine Learning Engineer, which equips them with specific skills sought after in the industry. In 2024, it is definitely a good alternative to a 4 year college degree.\n\nThe Alpahebet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Udacity Nanodegree program offers courses in various fields like data science, artificial intelligence, and web development. Each Nanodegree typically consists of several courses, providing hands-on projects and personalized feedback. Learners can access video lectures, quizzes, and community support. Completion time varies, with programs ranging from 3 to 12 months.\n\n6. Join the Military Services\n\nIM Score: 30\n\nMilitary service provides hands-on experience in a variety of roles, including technical, logistical, and tactical positions, which can translate directly into civilian careers. Additionally, the military often offers financial support for further education, including assistance with tuition fees and specialized training programs. Moreover, serving in the military can instill values like teamwork, resilience, and adaptability, which are highly valued in both professional and personal endeavors.\n\nClick here to see the 5Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n12 Most Useless Associate Degrees if You Want a High-Paying Job 40 Highest Paying Jobs Without a Degree in the US 25 Best Online Degree Programs For Working Adults\n\nDisclosure: None. 12Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Uncertain Times Call for Certain Yields: 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "In an ecosystem of high interest rates, targeting high-yield dividend stocks to buy might seem risky. After all, why bother dealing with the volatility of publicly traded businesses when you can buy safe, secure government bonds? The thesis isn\u2019t as irrational as it sounds.\n\nSure, you can grab 10-year Treasuries that yield 4.3%. For the buy-and-hold types, that\u2019s admittedly quite a deal. However, with the Federal Reserve possibly toying with the idea of interest rate cuts down the line, the buying opportunity for bonds may eventually fade. Second, buying government debt doesn\u2019t give you the chance for capital appreciation.\n\nBut arguably the most important reason to consider high-yield dividend stocks to buy is the possible rotation away from risk-on names. Recently, technology-related securities saw $4.4 billion of outflows, the biggest such outflow on record. Right now, you\u2019re seeing the red-hot cryptocurrency sector hit pause on the rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m not saying run around like your hair\u2019s on fire. Rather, it just might be prudent to consider enterprises that offer robust passive income. With that, below are attractive high-yield dividend stocks to buy.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah \u2013 I talk way too much about IBM (NYSE:IBM). However, after years of disappointing trading sessions, the company is starting to finally look appealing. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained just under 20%. Over the past year, the security moved up almost 54%. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re not talking about Big Blue.\n\nYou can credit artificial intelligence, machine learning and similar directives for a good chunk of the upside. While investors chase the usual suspects tied to digital intelligence, what I appreciate about IBM is that it has a long legacy of AI-related research and development. Also, it features ample case studies of real, practical innovations leveraging AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, when analysts are looking for average earnings per share of $10.09 on sales of $63.77 for the current fiscal year, I believe it. The projections might even be understated. Either way, while you\u2019re waiting for the narrative to play out, IBM investors can enjoy a solid forward dividend yield of 3.43%.\n\nExperts only rate IBM a consensus hold with a $191.69 price target. Here, the high-side target of $220 seems more reflective of current realities.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, identifying Chevron (NYSE:CVX) as one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy might go against contemporary beliefs. After all, electric vehicles are the future, climate justice, go green, yada yada. However, hydrocarbons could very well be relevant for decades, maybe even centuries. Amid economic difficulties, you can\u2019t just throw away infrastructure that\u2019s been built for the combustion-powered paradigm.\n\nWe all got a taste of that recently. Following a key decision by the Department of Energy, EV stocks tumbled as government mandates to effectively force the electric transition have been softened. This update gives traditional automakers breathing room. It also means that there\u2019s a runway for manufacturing gasoline-powered cars to 2030.\n\nAnd who knows what could happen in the future? I\u2019m almost certain that if President Joe Biden wins reelection this year, voters will pivot to the right in 2028. That could be very lucrative for CVX stakeholders.\n\nRight now, Chevron pays a forward yield of 4.16%. Combined with a moderate buy rating, CVX ranks among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy.\n\nDine Brands (DIN) din stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the riskiest ideas for high-yield dividend stocks to buy, Dine Brands (NYSE:DIN) might even seem reckless. Since the start of the year, DIN lost more than 5% of equity value. But that\u2019s not the worst of it. No, investors will quickly point to the loss of 31% over the past 52 weeks. That\u2019s ugly and it\u2019s not surprising given the consumer headwinds impacting the space.\n\nHowever, many experts believe that revenge travel \u2013 or a similar sentiment or residual effect \u2013 will support a key segment of the discretionary retail sector. If that happens to be the case, then people may look to save money through cheap eateries. It doesn\u2019t get that much cheaper than Dine Brands until you fall into the fast-food category.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the company \u2013 despite significant sector headwinds \u2013 managed to beat earnings-per-share targets in all four quarters last fiscal year. The average positive earnings beat came out to nearly 17%.\n\nRight now, Dine offers a forward yield of 4.4%. Carrying a strong buy consensus view, DIN should be on your radar.\n\nAgree Realty (ADC) Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nStructured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) focuses on the acquisition and development of properties net leased to industry-leading, omnichannel retail tenants. Per its public profile, the REIT owns and operates a portfolio of 2,135 properties, located in 49 states and containing approximately 44.2 million square feet of gross leasable area.\n\nSo, a lot of companies make their business sound way more complicated than it needs to be. Here\u2019s the deal with ADC stock. If you need something \u2013 groceries, a quick bite to eat, a home-improvement product \u2013 there\u2019s a good chance that the store you go to will be located on a property that Agree owns. Unless you envision a world where commerce becomes obsolete, Agree should maintain permanent relevance.\n\nTo be fair, the company missed earnings targets last year. However, in the current fiscal year, analysts believe that Agree will print EPS of $1.86 on revenue of $593.58 million. Last year, the company delivered EPS of $1.63 on sales of $537.5 million.\n\nLastly, Agree pays out a forward yield of 5.32%. Combined with a strong buy view, ADC is easily one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nA big tobacco firm, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) undoubtedly represents one of the most controversial names in the market. Still, for those who are agnostic about people\u2019s personal decisions, PM could rank among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy. Per the company\u2019s public profile, Philip Morris\u2019 product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products.\n\nSince the start of the year, PM stock slipped just a bit below parity. However, recent sessions suggest that a turnaround may be possible. For one thing, the company generally can be relied upon to produce solid earnings. That said, it did miss expectations in Q4. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate that EPS for the current fiscal year will come in at $6.40. That\u2019s noticeably above last year\u2019s print of $6.01.\n\nMoreover, the top line could rise to $37.17 billion, 5.4% above last year\u2019s result of $35.25 billion. And in fiscal 2025, revenue could hit $39.56 billion, implying over 6% year-over-year growth. Factor in the forward yield of 5.47% and a moderate buy consensus view and PM could be an intriguing wager.\n\nB2Gold (BTG) b2gold (BTG) logo on a web browser enlarged by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA gold-mining enterprise, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) operates the Fekola Mine in Mali, the Masbate Mine in the Philippines, and the Otjikoto Mine in Namibia. Per its corporate profile, B2Gold also has a 100% interest in the Gramalote gold project in Colombia among other endeavors. While gold-related investments occasionally perform well in periods of uncertainty, this didn\u2019t rub off BTG stock.\n\nIndeed, shares slipped almost 21% since the beginning of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, BTG is down nearly 34%. Obviously, B2Gold isn\u2019t an investment for the faint of heart. To emphasize this point, just look at the financials. While the company handily beat the EPS target in Q1 last year, the other results weren\u2019t so great. Overall, the average earnings surprise came out to a mere 0.45%.\n\nMoreover, experts are anticipating a \u201clost\u201d year in fiscal 2024. However, 2025 could see a turnaround, with revenue possibly coming in at $2.39 billion. While investors wait for the narrative to pan out, they can collect a forward dividend yield of 6.43%.\n\nAnalysts also peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a $4.15 price target, implying 67% upside potential. Thus, it could be one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy for speculators.\n\nAlliance Resource Partners (ARLP) A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (ARLP)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh\u00a0/\u00a0Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want the most extreme of high-yield dividend stocks to buy, you might want to consider Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP). Straight off the bat, you need to know that Alliance is structured as a master limited partnership (MLP). Now, MLPs provide the tax benefits of a partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities. Long story short, MLPs pass through the majority of their income and tax liabilities directly to their investors.\n\nPart of the joy of owning an MLP like Alliance is the often-hefty dividend yield. In this case, we\u2019re talking about a forward annual dividend yield of 14.08%. Further, the payout ratio is relatively reasonable at 58.21%. All other things being equal, investors can depend on the reliability of this source of passive income.\n\nOn the other hand, the pain associated with MLPs is that because the tax liabilities are passed through to individual unit holders, investors must file a Form K-1, which details their share of the partnership\u2019s income and losses on their individual tax returns.\n\nStill, one last positive parting shot is ARLP\u2019s moderate buy rating with a $27 price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "IBM Eyes First Record Since 2013 as AI Optimism Fuels 19% Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 One of the oldest companies in tech has been quietly trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team What Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago\u2019s Most Elite Neighborhood Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. recently hit its highest since 2013, putting it about 6% below an all-time high as investors bet that a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM\u2019s 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n\u201cIBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,\u201d said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm\u2019s cash flow generation and \u201chealthy\u201d dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.\n\nMuch of the year\u2019s advance followed IBM\u2019s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.\n\nThe stock\u2019s surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM\u2019s 82% gain over the same period.\n\nWall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM\u2019s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBM\u2019s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the company\u2019s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. \u201cWe can easily do better elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIn a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its biggest companies, an index of small-cap tech stocks is down 7% this year, making it a dramatic underperformer compared with other size categories. The S&P 500 tech sector index, which tracks large-cap tech stocks, is up 12% in 2024. However, an index of mid-cap tech has done best of all, with a gain of 14%.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co. after the telecom giant notched a significant technological breakthrough last year, people familiar with the matter said. The US will award Intel Corp. $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor factories, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday, marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the domestic chip industry. Tencent Holdings Ltd. plans to more than double its stock buyback program to at least $12.8 billion in 2024, mollifying investors concerned about a gradual dissipation of growth during a Chinese economic downturn. Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea\u2019s largest company. PocketHealth Inc. has raised $33 million from new investors including Deloitte Ventures and Samsung Next, joining a growing crop of startups gathering capital to explore the use of AI in healthcare.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nJinkoSolar Kingsoft Cloud Postmarket\n\nMicron\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion China\u2019s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers\u2019 $700 Million Man, Will Transform Baseball\u2014If He Wants To Julius Baer Hits Reboot to Escape Swiss Banking\u2019s New Malaise Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "IBM (IBM) ended the recent trading session at $193.34, demonstrating a +0.86% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.57%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.83%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.39%.\n\nShares of the technology and consulting company witnessed a gain of 2.16% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 3.42% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.97%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of IBM will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.59, up 16.91% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $14.56 billion, up 2.18% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $10.07 per share and a revenue of $63.79 billion, demonstrating changes of +4.68% and +3.12%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.01% upward. IBM is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note IBM's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.05. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.45, which means IBM is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also important to note that IBM currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.76. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Integrated Systems industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.62 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 99, positioning it in the top 40% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nInvestors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.\n\nThe research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) are some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks that are grabbing investors' attention.

It uses a scale from 1 to 5, with each number indicating a different recommendation:\n\nStrong Buy Buy Hold Underperform Sell\n\nFrom this ranking, we selected the stocks with scores of 2.5 or less.\n\nWe also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 funds as of Q4 2023.

        "title": "How IBM Makes Most Of Its Money Might Surprise You, and Excite You",
        "content": "Investors of a certain age may remember that International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) -- better known as IBM -- was a powerhouse in its prime. That was back in the 80s and 90s, when mainframe computers and then personal computers first started to become common. IBM's hardware was a centerpiece of the movement. The company even remained relatively relevant into the early 2000s.\n\nSlowly but surely, however, competition chipped away at its dominance. Its sales ultimately peaked in 2012 because IBM didn't do much to address then-nascent opportunities like cloud computing, mobile devices, and cybersecurity. It's been so long since IBM has mattered that many investors have all but forgotten about it.\n\nWell, IBM is back. It can't be said that it's better than ever. But it's looking like a more promising investment than it has in a long, long time. This new IBM, though, is very different than the hardware-centric one that older investors might recall from yesteryear.\n\nMeet the new-and-improved IBM\n\nIBM has managed a consulting business for decades now, even if this work was entirely related to the use of its systems. And, for as long as its computers could be programmed, the company's supplied some sort of software.\n\nThe importance of these different operations has been shaken up over the course of the past several years, however. Software has become IBM's single biggest source of revenue as the company turns up the heat on hybrid cloud computing. Its consulting business is still sizable, but it's a distant second now, with infrastructure (hardware) running a close third in terms of sales. Data source: IBM. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\n\nThis might be surprising to investors who remember what IBM used to be. But it shouldn't be too surprising. This is a change the company's known was coming -- and even intended -- for years now.\n\nAs CFO James Kavanaugh reminded investors last month at Morgan Stanley's annual Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, for every dollar's worth of systems that IBM sells, it generates an additional $3 to $5 worth of eventual software revenue and between $6 and $8 worth of services sales. One product or service doesn't really work without the other. This is how the company's top and bottom lines have remained so stable of late, even if the growth rates for both are modest.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's only half of the bullish picture for this particular business model, though. What's not highlighted by these numbers is how this platform/software/services mix drives the greatest degree of revenue for the company's highest-margin business. That's software. Roughly 80% of IBM's software sales are converted into gross profits, making it (by a country mile) the company's top income driver. Data source: IBM. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\n\nSurprised? Don't be. Think about it. Hardware is manufacturing-intensive since each unit produced requires the purchase of several technological components. Consulting requires people. Software, however, is very different. Once the code is written, it can be readily copied and distributed at little to no cost.\n\nFor income investors, there's very little not to like\n\nThis shift in the business model is a two-edged sword. While it sets the stage for consistent sales and earnings, it also limits potential growth rates. IBM sells systems at competitive, lower-margin prices in order to spur higher-margin service and software sales. The ensuing cloud-centric software and consulting revenue, though, is only booked on a quarterly basis from that point forward. It could take years for a customer to update their tech with the purchase of a new platform that prompts a new service or consulting contract, or renews the need for software to make the hardware work.\n\nIn many ways, though, this model simplifies the business into one that IBM can execute very well. The ultimate goal is simply bringing more clients into the fold. Once they're onboard, they'll likely remain onboard as paying customers for a while. Indeed, some of them will remain lifetime customers just because they're already familiar with IBM's offerings.\n\nAs for investors, IBM's shift toward a services- and software-oriented business model bodes well for the company's future cash flow, and for this tech stock's future dividends. To this end, IBM is expecting free cash flow of $12 billion this year. That's up from last year's figure of $11.2 billion, which is up from only $9.3 billion a year earlier. You can plug into this cash cow while the stock's dividend yield stands at 3.4%. By the way, this yield is based on a dividend that's been raised every year for the past 28 years.\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.07 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 indicates a change of +5.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.2%. The $63.79 billion and $66.59 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.1% and +4.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $17.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $3.87 for the same period compares with $3.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.59%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- At the screenings of Ryan Gosling\u2019s new movie The Fall Guy and Sydney Sweeney\u2019s Immaculate \u2014 headlining events of the first week of this year\u2019s South by Southwest conference \u2014 a reel of speakers touting the merits of AI including Peter Deng, head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, was loudly booed by audiences.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Probing Indian Billionaire Gautam Adani and His Group Over Potential Bribery A $2 Billion Airport Will Test Modi\u2019s Mission, Adani\u2019s Ambitions Fed Seen Sticking With Three 2024 Cuts Despite Higher Inflation Bitcoin Extends Retreat From Record as \u2018Bubble\u2019 Talk Escalates S&P 500 Falls Amid $5.3 Trillion \u2018Triple Witching\u2019: Markets Wrap\n\nIn other halls of the annual Austin confab, which attracts over 300,000 people each year, the tone was one of heady optimism. Companies were spinning a positive narrative \u2014 pushing the idea that AI wouldn\u2019t destroy jobs, but rather represented a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernize a multitude of industries.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. Chief Human Resources Officer Nickle LaMoreaux told a SXSW panel that AI will instead alleviate labor shortages that are set to worsen as birth rates decline across developed economies. And while only a tiny percentage of jobs can be completely automated, the vast majority won\u2019t disappear \u2014 but will change dramatically.\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to go out there and set the record straight on this,\u201d LaMoreaux said. \u201cThe thing we need to be rightfully scared about is job change \u2014 and how are we going to get ready for that.\u201d\n\nThe sparring over AI at SXSW, a conference known as a venue to vet new ideas, was a sampling of the debate over whether AI is a force for good or bad \u2014 especially for workers. While 42% of office workers say they\u2019re excited for AI to take over some of their tasks at work, some 27% find the prospect concerning, according to a global survey from Slack of over 10,000 employees conducted in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM made news last May when Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg the company expects to pause hiring for back-office roles it thinks could be replaced with AI in the coming years. \u201cAny of you that support CEOs, you know that sometimes the worst thing they can do is go talk to the media \u2014 it makes your job a little harder,\u201d LaMoreaux said, adding that Krishna\u2019s comments were taken a \u201clittle out of context.\u201d\n\nRead More: AI Regulation Is Needed to Support US Workers in Future, Business Officials Say\n\nStill, recent reports have stoked fears about AI job replacement. On Tuesday, IBM reportedly told employees it was cutting staff in its marketing and communications department, prompting more headlines about AI-related layoffs. Fintech firm Klarna said last month that its new AI chatbot tool is already doing the work of 700 full-time customer-service agents, putting the company on track to improve profits by $40 million this year.\n\nResponding to a question about Klarna\u2019s announcement, Jim Link, chief human resources officer of the Society for Human Resource Management, said that the research is mixed on what impact AI will have on jobs. \u201cThere\u2019s other research out there that shows that AI will actually generate more jobs than it eliminates,\u201d he said. But nearly a year and a half into the current AI hype cycle, it remains unclear what those new AI jobs will be, aside from the much-cited \u201cprompt engineer\u201d and the new c-suite entrant, \u201cchief AI officer.\u201d\n\nRead More: AI Is Driving More Layoffs Than Companies Want to Admit\n\nUltimately, Link said, the moment has come for companies and workers to invest in AI training, a sentiment echoed by other executives at the conference. \u201cThose people who are AI-savvy and have AI skills could replace those who do not have the skills,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt about that.\u201d\n\nOn another panel, Donald Knight, chief human resources officer of hiring software company Greenhouse, waved off concerns about entry-level jobs automated away by AI. Instead, armed with new technologies, he argued younger workers will be able to do more fulfilling work and make more meaningful contributions right away, instead of shouldering the grunt work that\u2019s traditionally been a right of passage.\n\n\u201cThese types of tools that they\u2019re growing up on are going to allow them to deploy creativity in your companies like you\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be phenomenal.\u201d\n\nIn other rooms, the tone was more cautious. Major TV and film studios\u2019 use of AI was a point of contention in contract talks with Hollywood writers and actors, prolonging the strike by SAG-AFTRA. Though the final deal included some protections from automation, many industry luminaries worry the provisions didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re anxious about AI, while everyone is saying, \u2018Chase it! Get ahead of it!,\u2019 it\u2019s because you know deep down, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re next,\u2019\u201d Daniel Kwan, co-director of Everything Everywhere All at Once, said in a keynote address. \u201cEven if the jobs aren't going to be lost, the value of the job will go down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say we shouldn\u2019t use AI, Kwan said: \u201cAI is here. It is going to be rapidly deployed in every aspect of our lives.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls America\u2019s Plumber Deficit Isn\u2019t Good for the Economy Gold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them When It Comes to Texas, Is Musk All Hat and No Cattle?

The corporation distributes cash to its investors each month. The high yield makes it more difficult for the stock to gain value, but it\u2019s still up by a respectable 20% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe firm prioritizes debt investments in the lower middle market. That focus reduces Main Street Capital\u2019s correlation with the broader market. If the stock market endures a correction, MAIN stock is less likely to go down with other equities. The Main Street Capital team has been working together for over 20 years and has more than 100 years of cumulative experience.\n\nMain Street Capital\u2019s portfolio consists of 190 companies and has its capital spread across dozens of industries. The firm\u2019s three largest industries are Machinery (8%), Internet Software & Services (5%), and Professional Services (6%). Its capital is spread across the United States with a big emphasis on the Western and Northeastern regions.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has experienced a resurgence as the company continues to modernize with cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Shares are up by 56% over the past year and currently have a 24 P/E ratio. The stock also offers a 3.40% dividend yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM hasn\u2019t raised its dividend by much. The firm hiked its quarterly dividend from $1.65 per share to $1.66 per share in 2023. The company is due for a dividend hike in the next quarter, which can set for a higher growth rate. IBM\u2019s financials support the possibility of a dividend hike that\u2019s greater than $0.01 per share.\n\nThe tech giant closed out the fourth quarter of 2023 with 4% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and 21% YoY net income growth. That\u2019s an acceleration from full-year revenue growth of 2% YoY.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t the type of stock to outperform the stock market. However, it can deliver consistent dividend payouts with a lower margin of risk than high-flying growth stocks.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) has a lower yield than the other two stocks on this list. The tech conglomerate has a 1.30% dividend yield and trades at a 33 P/E ratio. Oracle hikes its dividend every two years. It\u2019s less frequent than the other picks, but the dividend hikes are massive. Oracle last hiked its quarterly dividend in 2023 from $0.32 per share to $0.40 per share. That\u2019s a 25% increase over two years.\n\nOracle has also outperformed the other two stocks on this list thanks to strong demand for its cloud computing segment and rising profit margins. Shares are up by 46% over the past year and 137% over the past five years.\n\nThe firm reported solid earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue was up by 5% YoY, with significant growth in the company\u2019s cloud segments. Overall, cloud revenue increased by 25% YoY and is becoming a larger percentage of total revenue. Oracle\u2019s cloud growth will translate into higher revenue and earnings growth rates in future quarters.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These devices can collect, and more importantly, exchange data with each other and central systems over the internet. They gather information to make decisions and interact with the physical world and digital systems.\n\nThe IoT market is one of the fastest-growing ones globally. Growth is propelled by an increased demand for automation and an increasing need for big data for data management. Research and cloud computing platforms are also driving the growth of IoT. In addition, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also pushing the market's growth. Its market size, which was $328.6 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. The global IoT market will experience a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.46% during this forecast period. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at 33%.\n\nThe IoT market is segmented by components, deployment, organization size, platform, technology, and industry verticals. The software segment has the largest share when segmented according to component. The cloud segment leads in the deployment segmentation, whereas the enterprise segment has the largest share when segmented according to organization size. In addition, the network communication segment has the largest market share when segmented according to technology.\n\nIoT devices often rely on ML and AI to carry out their tasks. Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Echo devices are an example of IoT devices that use AI to enhance their capabilities. These devices are smart speakers that come with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. Recently, Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has made many AI-related enhancements to Alexa to give it a more opinionated personality. These enhancements also give it the ability to adjust tone and response to express emotions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently, generative AI like ChatGPT has gained the attention of tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), among others. The AI market is currently in the stage of maturation and has significant opportunities for real-world application. It has a positive long-term growth outlook, and these tech giants are looking to cash in on this opportunity.\n\nThe global AI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% during the forecast period of 2022-2023. It was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $2,575 billion by 2032. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at more than 36%. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to expand the highest during this forecast period with a CAGR of 20.3%.\n\nThe AI market can be segmented according to technology, solution, and end user. Technology-wise, deep learning has the largest share. The services segment takes the lead when segmented according to the solution. When segmented according to end users, banking, financial services & insurance (BSFI) takes the lead.\n\nAI's flexibility and adaptability are driving its growth. Some of the areas where it is being increasingly used are life-saving medical devices and self-driving features in electric cars. This growth is also propelled by an increasing investment from top tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) for the upgradation and development of various applications of AI. One of the supplier-side factors driving the growth of AI is the vendor and end-user industries' partnership to enhance reach. An example of such a partnership is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Intelligent Network's collaboration with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also causing disruption left and right. A startup founded by an ex-Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa scientist is looking to disrupt the investment industry through AI. Theia Insights recently raised $6.5 million. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of financial information through AI and other tech so investors can make better decisions.\n\nMachine learning and deep learning-based healthcare detection systems are also emerging trends in the industry. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s machine learning technology advances the early detection of diabetic eye disease using deep learning. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s diabetic eye disease detection technology is found to be 86% accurate in classifying the severity of the disease across the five levels recognized on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.\n\nOne of the ongoing trends in AI is experimentation in advertising. AI giants such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Co-pilot, open AI's Chat GPT, and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Gemini are experimenting with ads so they could solve the monetization issue of generative AI. Most people are not willing to spend $20 every month for premium generative AI models such as GPT-4. So, ads could soon take over chatbots, which would provide these companies with a more viable revenue model. This is already been done by Adzedek which introduces itself as an AI chatbot advertising market palace. The company lets brands run sponsored ads in its custom chatbots, the revenue of which is shared between Adzedek and the chatbot creator.\n\nThere is severe competition within the AI industry which also comes from new entrants. A Palo Alto-based startup by the name of Inflection AI has developed a generative chatbot that is considered as powerful as the GPT-4 model, especially across STEM subjects. This Inflection AI model is currently powering Pi, Inflection AI's voice assistant. Many people consider Pi to be ChatGPT that can take commands in the form of voice inputs.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.  10 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\nPhoto by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa, we used five (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the speaker appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of speakers in our sources.

        "title": "2 Data Analytics Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March",
        "content": "The excitement surrounding data analytics investments is firmly grounded in reality, underscored by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the ever-increasing flow of data.\n\nCompanies across the board are eager to harness real-time data to fuel their AI systems, aiming to unlock significant business advantages. Specialists in data analytics play a crucial role in both streamlining the process of feeding new data into the AI engines and empowering organizations to make data-driven business decisions.\n\nOn that note, let me show you two fantastic investment opportunities in today's data analytics industry. Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) is an innovative market darling with room to grow. IBM(NYSE: IBM) is an old-school tech titan with a new lease on life in the AI era.\n\nPalantir: Richly valued for good reasons\n\nData analytics expert Palantir is not a cheap stock. The share price has more than tripled over the last year and Palantir trades at nearly 300 times trailing earnings or 27 times sales.\n\nWith these lofty valuation ratios, one might expect Palantir to a small-cap start-up with skinny profit margins supported by modest yet skyrocketing sales. But its annual sales passed the $2 billion benchmark last year and Palantir's net profit margin stands at a robust 9%. The year-over-year revenue growth stopped at 17% in 2023, down from 24% in 2022 and 41% before that.\n\nYet, Palantir has earned its nosebleed-inducing valuation by plotting a clear path to continued growth.\n\nThe company started as a specialist in defense solutions. That's still an important business but Palantir is expanding its reach to commercial clients, too. Commercial sales are growing faster than government revenues, accounting for 45% of total sales last year. And the shift is accelerating right now. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2024, Palantir's management expects total revenues to increase by roughly 20%. However, U.S. commercial sales should lead the charge with a jump of \"at least 40%.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKeep in mind that government contracts often come with lower profit margins than business-to-business services, and you're looking at a promising recipe for profitable growth. Palantir's business is expanding in a more lucrative direction, as the company becomes a leading provider of AI-based data analytics tools. Yes, AI analytics can optimize the data feed that becomes the next generation of machine learning or large language model (LLM) AI platforms.\n\nPalantir's commitment to advancing AI and machine learning innovation places it at the forefront of analytics technology, enhancing its platforms with AI-driven insights and predictive analytics. This commitment not only enriches its service offerings but also lets clients make the most of their data in sophisticated and impactful ways. The scalability of Palantir's solutions makes defense-quality data analytics available to anyone, letting organizations of any size benefit from the company's cutting-edge AI technology.\n\nThrough these strategic advantages, Palantir Technologies has carved out a leading position in the data analytics and AI sector, demonstrating a clear path for continued growth and innovation. So the stock may be expensive, but for all the right reasons. The company should grow into its roomy boots over time, supporting its market value with stronger profits and continued top-line growth.\n\nDon't forget about IBM\n\nBig Blue rarely shows up in the AI conversation, and since most investors prefer to focus on newer and fresher names. A shorter operating history can be OK as long as the growth story looks good, right?\n\nWell, good old IBM actually combines the best qualities of an experienced tech giant and an exciting AI expert. The company is entering an impressive growth phase, powered by cloud computing and AI services, that should drive sales and free cash flows dramatically higher over the next few years. But most investors haven't noticed this unstoppable growth spurt yet, so the stock trades at the modest valuation ratios of 24 times earnings and 2.9 times sales.\n\nIf Palantir's valuation is too rich for your blood, IBM could be the value-priced AI investment you're looking for.\n\nAnd AI-assisted data analytics play a massive part in IBM's future growth story. It's anchored by the powerful Watson AI platform, and its data analytics services are a cornerstone of IBM's offerings in the cutting-edge technology landscape.\n\nWatson AI uses advanced machine learning and natural language processing to analyze vast data sets, enabling businesses to uncover insights, predict outcomes, and make data-driven decisions with unprecedented accuracy and speed.\n\nThat sounds a lot like Palantir, but it's not the whole story. Beyond this fundamental analytical prowess, Watson's applications span a broad range of industry-specific features. In healthcare, it assists in diagnosing diseases and recommending treatments. In finance, IBM's Watson enhances risk management and customer service. And that's just a fleeting glance at a robust sector-spanning portfolio.\n\nIBM complements Watson's AI capabilities with a robust suite of analytics tools and cloud services. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive ecosystem that supports the entire data lifecycle from collection and storage to analysis and visualization. This holistic approach helps clients leverage their data to the max, driving innovation and efficiency across their operations.\n\nInvestors started to open their eyes to IBM's AI-driven prospects around January's earnings report. The stock has gained 20% in three months and 30% in half a year, but IBM's shares are still cheap in comparison to other AI investments. If you don't have any Big Blue shares in your portfolio yet, this would be a good time to grab a few shares on the cheap. I don't know how much longer the bargain-bin stock price will last. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIf you believe in the transformative power of AI and data analytics, both Palantir and IBM deserve a spot on your watchlist. The market's always evolving, and sometimes the best moves are made when others aren't paying attention.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "At the end of every year, we\u2019re presented with the top\u00a0Dogs of the Dow. Made up of the hardest-hit Dow stocks, which also pay out hefty dividend yields, you buy the Dogs at the start of the year, and cash out at the end of the year with hopeful wins in hand.\n\nIn 2023, the Dogs of the Dow returned about 10.1%, as compared to the 14.4% gains on the overall Dow Jones Industrial Average.The 2022 Dogs of the Dow did beat the major indices. In fact, while the Dogs of the Dow stocks fell 1.6% on the year, once you add in the dividend payouts, the Dogs returned 2% on the year. While 2% may not sound like a big win, consider that, in 2022, one of the worst years on record since 2008, the Dow Jones lost about 9%.\n\nAs for 2024, here\u2019s how the Dogs of the Dow have done year to date:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ran from about $380 to $387, and yields 2.84% Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ran from $156 to $159.52, and yields 2.98% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been about flat at $59, yielding 3.26% Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) fell from $285 to a low of $273.75, and yields 3.29% Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) fell from about $50 to $49.50, yielding 3.23% IBM (NYSE:IBM) jumped from about $160 to $195.95, yielding 3.39% Chevron (NYSE:CVX) ran from about $148 to $149.88, yielding 4.35% Dow (NYSE:DOW) ran from about $54 to $56.61, yielding 4.95% 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) fell from about $107 to $93.90, yielding 6.43% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) ran from $37.10 to $39.51, yielding 6.73%\n\nOf those, we expect these three top Dogs of the Dow of 2024 to run even more.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

Helping, the company\u2019s WatsonX AI platform is its newest AI and data platform that allows, \u201cAI builders to train, test and deploy generative AI capabilities powered by foundation models,\u201d according to TechTarget.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter, IBM is seeing massive improvements to productivity thanks to the AI boom. And, as IBM noted late last year, \u201cIf you leverage AI correctly, there\u2019s probably $10 trillion of productivity that will be reaped by companies and governments over the next 10 years,\u201d\u00a0as quoted by CNBC.\n\nEven better, the company just forecast full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digits, which is higher than expectations for 2.8%. It also guided for stronger free cash flow of $12 billion for the year, driven by higher profitability.\n\n\u201cInvestment firm BofA labeled the company\u2019s free cash flow guide as \u2018the standout metric\u2019, comfortably beating its expectations of $11 billion \u2013 $11.5 billion. For UBS, the company\u2019s full-year free cash flow outlook was a positive surprise compared to its estimate of $11 billion,\u201d\u00a0as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon started the year off well but from here, I\u2019d initially like to see VZ challenge $43 again. Helping, Verizon just\u00a0declared a 66.5 cent quarterly dividend, which is payable May 1 to shareholders of record as of April 10.\n\nThat dividend also appears to be safe. Late last year, company CEO Hans Erik Vestberg said Verizon\u2019s \u201cdividend coverage is very healthy. Year-to-date our free cash flow dividend payout ratio is approximately 56%, a significant improvement from a year ago,\u201d as\u00a0quoted by Barron\u2019s.\n\nThe company also just forecast an adjusted EPS range of $4.50 to $4.70 for the full-year. That\u2019s higher than expectations, and is being supported by an impressive increase in wireless subscribers with net additions up about 400,000 in the fourth quarter. Even better, its free cash flow (FCF) is on the rise, with its FCF up to $18.7 billion for 2023 from $14.1 billion in 2022.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) An image of an old red and rusted fridge door with a metal \"Coca-Cola\" logo handle and white embroidered text that reads \"Drink\" in a small font and \"Coca-Cola\" below in a very large font.\n\nSource: phloxii / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the year began, Coca-Cola has been trading sideways, bouncing around in a tight channel between $59 and $61. Now at the lower range of the channel, I expect for the stock to again pivot higher immediate term. Longer term, I\u2019d like to see KO to break above resistance around $62, with a potential test of $64.\n\nHelping, the company just\u00a0raised its dividend to 48.5 cents, which is payable on Apr. 1 to shareholders of record as of Mar. 15.\n\nTwo,\u00a0KO is still one of Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite stocks. Three, even though it\u2019s been forced to raise prices, its sales are still strong. It fourth quarter EPS of 49 cents came in in-line. Revenue of $10.88 billion \u2014 up about 7% year over year \u2014 beat by $150 million. And four, analysts at JP Morgan just raised their price target to $66, with an overweight rating.\n\nAs noted by TheFly.com, \u201cThe company reported another strong quarter with better than expected sales performance and strong gross margin, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best edge computing stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the edge computing market, head over to 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhat is Edge Computing?\n\nEdge computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In simple terms, edge computing involves relocating a part of storage and computing capabilities from the central data center to close proximity of data sources. Rather than sending raw data to a central facility for analysis, computation is performed at the location where the data is generated and only the computed results, like real-time business insights or equipment maintenance predictions, are transmitted back to the central data center. Devices such as smart speakers, watches, and phones, which engage in edge computing by locally collecting and processing data, are already a part of our daily lives.\n\nContrary to what some may think, edge computing doesn't need a separate \"edge network.\" It can work on single devices or routers. If a separate network is used, 5G is important, offering fast wireless connections. This enables cool applications like autonomous drones, remote surgeries, and smart cities. The edge network is useful when on-site computing is too expensive or complex, but fast responses are needed, and the cloud is too distant. Edge networks enable local computation, allowing devices at the edge (like sensors, cameras, or IoT devices) to process data and make decisions without the need to send all information to a centralized cloud for analysis.\n\nThe Intelligent Edge aims to provide faster, more reliable, and efficient processing for quicker decision-making and reduced dependence on centralized cloud systems, which may face issues like latency and bandwidth. However, deploying and managing edge computing infrastructures pose challenges due to technological complexity, overwhelming data volume, and interoperability issues. Gartner predicts that by 2026, at least 50% of edge computing deployments will involve machine learning. AI algorithms are well-suited for the data-rich environments of edge computing, enabling quick and accurate analysis of vast data sets. Integrating AI allows edge devices to independently process and act on collected data without constant communication with a central server. This integration enhances decision-making speed, crucial for applications like real-time inventory management or industrial equipment calibration.\n\nStory continues\n\nEdge Computing Market Size and Key Trends\n\nAccording to Expert Market Research, the global edge computing market is anticipated to grow significantly from $15.54 billion in 2023 to $147.38 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.4% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. This growth is attributed to the rise of autonomous vehicles, connected car networks, and the demand for lightweight frameworks and applications to enhance edge computing efficiency, creating numerous market opportunities. PwCexpects the global market for edge data centers to nearly triple, reaching $13.5 billion in 2024 from $4 billion in 2017. This growth is driven by the potential of locally located data centers to reduce latency, address intermittent connections, and enable data storage and computation in close proximity to end-users. Edge data centers are growing in popularity due to several key trends. The introduction of 5G is a big factor, as these smaller decentralized centers support high-density 5G applications with low costs and latency, especially in smart-city scenarios. Similarly, the increasing use of IoT devices requires quick data processing at the edge to handle the growing amount of information from sensors in homes and industries. Moreover, the adoption of software-defined networking and virtualization technologies allows software to replace expensive hardware in data centers. Lastly, the demand for video streaming and AR/VR is met by these cost-effective edge data centers, reducing latency and providing good performance for users.\n\nRead also: Top 15 Edge Computing Companies in the World\n\nWhat\u2019s New in the Edge Computing Market?\n\nOn January 5, 2024, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) disclosed that it is partnering with American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a global digital infrastructure provider, to accelerate the deployment of a hybrid, multi-cloud computing platform at the edge. This collaboration aims to expand American Tower's Access Edge Data Center ecosystem by integrating IBM Hybrid Cloud capabilities and Red Hat OpenShift. The goal is to help clients address evolving customer requirements and expectations in digital transformation, incorporating technologies like IoT, 5G, AI, and network automation. IBM plans to provide American Tower with a hybrid cloud platform, facilitating the creation of an edge cloud at American Tower's distributed real estate locations.\n\nSimilarly, on February 5, Ernst & Young announced that it has launched the EY Edge Technologies Lab, aiming to forefront edge ecosystem technologies in digital transformation. This initiative focuses on creating real-time, industry-specific use cases and prototypes for edge-centric solutions, integrating technology seamlessly into business operations. Leveraging EY.ai, a platform combining business experience with AI technology, the Lab demonstrates the advantages of embedding AI at the edge to optimize speed, performance, security, reliability, and resiliency for businesses. The Lab uses Dell NativeEdge and collaborates with Microsoft, PTC, GE Digital, Snowflake, and others to enhance business operations and leverage edge technology efficiently.\n\nSome of the best edge computing market leaders to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor a list of the best edge computing market leaders, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database of 933 hedge funds and picked 10 companies operating in the edge computing software and hardware services industry with the highest number of hedge funds.

It is a global cloud services provider offering cloud-based security solutions for different platforms, web and application security products, and performance optimization solutions such as content delivery and load balancing. The company also provides a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform called Cloudflare One, along with network services for connectivity, security, and performance.\n\nIn Q4 2023, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) reported adjusted earnings per share of 15 cents, surpassing analysts' expectations of 12 cents. The company's revenue for the quarter was $362.5 million, reflecting a 32% year-over-year increase and beating the anticipated $353 million. Cloudflare achieved record operating cash flow at $85.4 million, equivalent to 24% of total revenue, and set a quarterly free cash flow record at $50.7 million, representing 14% of total revenue.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 44 hedge funds were long Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel\u2019s Two Sigma Advisors is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2 million shares worth $165.4 million.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of the edge computing market leaders to watch.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMost of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: \u2022 Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare\u2019s platform: \u201cAnd so we\u2019re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass\u2026 that comes through in a lot of customer examples\u2026. People want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that\u2019s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.\u201d\n\n9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) ranks 9th on our list of edge computing market leaders. It provides integrated solutions and services globally through its Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing segments. IBM focuses on hybrid cloud and AI platforms, consulting for different industries, and offers on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure solutions. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the top edge computing market leaders.\n\nOn January 30, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.66 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on March 9, to shareholders on record as of February 9.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), compared to 53 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.45 million shares worth $238.5 million.\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNew positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM\u2019s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company\u2019s legacy businesses.\u201d\n\n8. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) provides data solutions globally through Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services, and Corporate Investments segments.

These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.\u201d\n\n6. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nArista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) specializes in developing, marketing, and selling data-driven networking solutions for data center and cloud networking, including AI-driven ethernet switching platforms, campus wired and wireless products, and routing systems. The company serves diverse industries such as internet companies, service providers, financial services, government agencies, media, and telecommunications. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) ranks 6th on our list of edge computing market leaders\n\nOn February 12, Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) reported Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.08, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $0.37. The revenue increased 20.3% year-over-year to $1.54 billion, in-line with market consensus.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were bullish on Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 833,408 shares worth $196.2 million.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is one of the notable edge computing market leaders.\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe did a bit of portfolio sculpting during the year, with mixed results. We trimmed Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) several times during the year as it soared. Those trims, a very small one in March at roughly $163 and a larger one in August at $183, don\u2019t look smart with Arista finishing the year at $235 (and up more in January). Arista rose 94% this year. The good news is, Arista finished the year as our second largest holding, at 7.9% of the portfolio.\n\nIf you are wondering how I could sell some Arista at $163 but then hold most of it at $235, the answer is that Arista\u2019s outstanding competitive position in Artificial Intelligence became clearer to me as the year progressed. I felt in March that Arista would earn $8 per share in a few years. I see today that it might earn $8 in 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s possible there is AI-related froth in the Arista stock price, but also probable that Arista will continue to grow rapidly as the computing centers that process AI queries require enormous amounts of data bandwidth. I believe Arista\u2019s routers and switches are the best tools for routing so-called hyperscale traffic. Also, its operating software allows computer giants to manage the kudzu-like growth of their data centers, lowering their total cost of operation.\n\nThe sales of both Arista and Heico reflected my desire to manage PE multiple risk. I keep learning the hard way, however, that trimming your winners generally doesn\u2019t add value. If the valuation is beyond justification, sell the position. If the valuation is high but the business continues to dominate its niche, grow steadily and add value for customers, maybe just take a walk around the block until the urge to sell goes away.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? This Enterprise AI Stock Is Still a Bargain.",
        "content": "While Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) AI-fueled rally may not be over, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify buying the stock as the GPU maker's valuation soars. With a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion as of midday Wednesday, the stock requires investors to ignore the myriad threats that could unravel the company's dominance of the AI chip market.\n\nThe biggest advantage Nvidia has comes from software. CUDA is Nvidia's software toolkit for developing applications that can be accelerated by its GPUs. CUDA has been around for 16 years and has become the de facto standard. As the AI boom got underway, the path of least resistance was Nvidia GPUs and CUDA-powered software.\n\nWhile there are alternatives to CUDA, there's a tremendous amount of inertia keeping Nvidia's dominance intact. Without this software advantage, competing AI chips from AMD, Intel, and others would be having an easier time winning market share.\n\nNvidia recently updated its end-user license agreement for CUDA to explicitly disallow translation layers that enable CUDA-based software to run on non-Nvidia hardware. The company is clearly worried about competition chipping away at its dominant market position. The end of CUDA's dominance would be a boon for any company that buys AI accelerators, and it's likely to happen sooner or later as AI companies seek alternatives.\n\nA low-risk way to bet on AI\n\nWhile Nvidia's competitive advantages will likely erode over time as competition heats up, International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is positioning itself to be the go-to platform for AI among large enterprises and organizations. The company's watsonx AI platform, which gets its name from the Watson AI supercomputer that won Jeopardy! in 2011, is aimed at the type of customers that can't throw caution to the wind as they adopt AI technology.\n\nThe watsonx platform enables enterprises to train, validate, and deploy AI models while keeping an eye on compliance, risk management, and governance issues. Companies that operate in highly regulated industries must follow strict rules regarding their data, and no company wants a customer-facing AI chatbot to go off the rails. IBM's watsonx platform provides guardrails for enterprises deploying AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond general use cases, watsonx has some specific capabilities that can drive adoption. IBM's mainframe systems, which have been at the heart of some industries for decades, run billions of lines of sensitive, mission-critical code written in an ancient programming language called COBOL. As the number of developers capable of writing and maintaining COBOL code declines, IBM's mainframe customers are put in a bind.\n\nThis is where the watsonx Code Assistant comes into play. One application for this product is modernizing COBOL code by transforming it into Java code. This process must be done with care because much of this code is highly sensitive -- think software that processes transactions at major financial institutions. This functionality will not only drive customers to adopt the watsonx platform but also strengthen the mainframe business by making it much easier to modernize applications.\n\nStill a bargain stock\n\nIBM stock has rallied over the past year, gaining about 50% in that time. Optimism about the company's AI prospects along with a string of solid results are the likely culprits behind the surge.\n\nEven as IBM stock closes in on its all-time high, the stock remains a great value for investors. The company expects to generate free cash flow of about $12 billion this year, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at 15. For comparison, other large tech companies trade at significantly higher multiples of free cash flow.

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\n(Reuters) - International Business Machines on Wednesday said that its initial testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Adobe has resulted in productivity improvements.\n\nIBM said it was using Adobe's tools, which can generate images from text-based prompts, to help with marketing campaigns. It is an early test of Adobe's strategy to create AI systems trained on its own proprietary data with legal guarantees against lawsuits, a strategy that Adobe hopes will lure in large businesses.\n\nBilly Seabrook, the global chief design officer for IBM's consulting arm, said that the 1,600 designers in his unit used Adobe's tools to help generate ideas quickly and create variants of them to be used in different parts of marketing campaigns.\n\n\"What typically would take us two weeks for an end-to-end cycle, we've gotten down to two days,\" Seabrook told Reuters.\n\nOverall IBM said it expects a 10-fold increase in the productivity of designers, who will be able to devote more time to brainstorming and creating storyboards instead of generating minor design variants.\n\nSeabrook said that in the short term, the most likely impact to design industry employment from use of the new tools will be to use existing teams to do more work.\n\n\"There's typically a rule of prioritization of what big bets you are going to go after and what staff you're going to put towards a problem. Theoretically, you're opening up more headroom to focus on some of those other problems,\" he said.\n\nThe long term impact on employment is less clear. Seabrook said recent IBM survey data showed most business leaders think designers are more important than ever.\n\n\"They have to be almost the tastemakers and the quality checkers of the output of the generative AI, as well as a little bit of the empathy in the room that helps train and fine-tune and curate that AI,\" Seabrook said.\n\nBut in other parts of the survey data, \"everyone agrees there are going to be fewer jobs,\" Seabrook said. \"We're waiting to see what happens.\"\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Michael Perry`)",

        "title": "7 Ultra-Reliable Dividend Stocks to Buy for Rock-Solid Returns",
        "content": "If you\u2019re searching for ultra-reliable dividend stocks to buy, look no further. Investors understand that securing one\u2019s future reliability is paramount. It\u2019s very difficult to build a retirement portfolio without accounting for volatility and mitigating its risks. Thus, investors choose to put their capital into reliable stocks. And few asset classes are as reliable as dividend stocks overall.\n\nFirst of all, firms that choose to pay a dividend tend to be stable in general. In order to pay a reliable dividend a firm requires reliable sources of capital. Second of all, those firms understand that missing a dividend payment will reduce their stock price dramatically. For that reason, companies that initiate a dividend payment are highly confident of their continued ability to do so.\n\nBearing all of that in mind, let\u2019s look at seven ultra-reliable dividend stocks to buy that investors can use to secure their respective futures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltria (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) might seem like an odd choice to some with which to start a list of reliable dividend stocks. The company made its fortune and established its name in the dying cigarette industry. Cigarette sales continue to decline in the high single digits. That seemingly puts its high yield dividend at risk.\n\nIndeed, Altria does face real risks. For one, the company is battling an illicit vaping market that continues to pull sales from its business. The company is facing declining cigarette sales and attempting to replace them with oral nicotine delivery products including snus.\n\nYet, Altria is also battling as it relates to its NJOY acquisition. The brands vape pods, pens, and E-cigarettes are selling well. Furthermore, Altria\u2019s dividends payout ratio remains below 0.8 and hasn\u2019t been reduced since 1970. It is highly unlikely that it will be reduced anytime soon as it is a primary point of attraction for investors. The current 9% yield on that dividend is like a magnet for investors and one that many should consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has emerged as one of the absolute best stocks for investors seeking a combination of strong dividend yields and artificial intelligence (AI) exposure.\n\nThe firm is strongly exposed to artificial intelligence via an AI platform and hybrid Cloud that will continue to gain it further exposure. Generally speaking, that sounds like the sort of wide-ranging opportunity that investors are likely to hear about any AI stock. Yet, it\u2019s necessary to think about IBM in broad terms. It is one of the most deeply integrated IT firms globally. It has a presence in just about every country worldwide and employs 350,000 people.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the most prominent companies in relation to the emergence of quantum computing. In short, the company is broadly exposed to many of the pillars of future tech growth that investors continue to push their capital into.\n\nThat broad exposure and massive footprint will continue to provide IBM with stability. One or more of those burgeoning areas will emerge quickly and provide growth to the firm. That should result in reinvestment in either future growth or the capital will instead be pushed into its very reliable dividend which was last reduced in 1994. There are merits to either case, both of which continue to make IBM shares attractive.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the more unique potential investments for those seeking the reliability of firms that have long paid a dividend. The firm operates through two business segments that make it quite unique overall. It is part ultra-reliable utilities firm and part high potential green energy firm.\n\nIt\u2019s also a stock that has suffered its fair share of troubles of late. The utilities side of the business was hammered by historically high bond yields that made its dividend pale in comparison. Concurrently, the renewable energy business suffered as the combination of unfavorable contract prices and rising interest rates made returns in the sector much weaker.\n\nBond yields are lower now and interest rates have normalized. It is widely expected that rate cuts will emerge in the coming months which should make the renewable energy business that much more attractive. As a result, NEE shares should rise. In the meantime, consider investing for its dividend which currently pays 3.7% and was last reduced in 1995.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is an important company in a sensitive cyclical portion of the stock market that is highly dependent on the health of the overall economy: the construction industry. Part of the reason that the overall economy is characterized as being \u2018healthy\u2019 is that firms can continue to charge higher prices. That\u2019s important in understanding Caterpillar.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true in the case of Caterpillar which recently saw its volumes decline while revenues increased beyond what Wall Street was expecting. One can easily argue that points to the sort of unhealthy inflation that we are trying to get past at this point. And thus, Caterpillar might arguably not be in such a great place.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s harder to argue against the industrial sector overall. It has proven especially resilient and outpaced the already strong S&P 500 in the early part of 2024. Industrial stocks are entering a period of strong cyclicality and Caterpillar is one of the most reliable dividend stocks to buy overall.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is one of the more prominent firms in connection with the lithium collapse. It\u2019s also an ultra-reliable dividend stock having last reduced its payment all the way back in 1994.\n\nAs a result, there is an easy bullish narrative favoring Albemarle at the moment. it provides investors with reliable income with which to secure their future portfolios while also exposing them to strong upside potential. Albemarle\u2019s share price is widely expected to rebound substantially and provide potential triple digit returns.\n\nYes, lithium sales are weak at the moment. However, Albemarle\u2019s most recent earnings report shows that 2023 was overall an incredible year for the firm. Sales grew by 31% reaching highest ever levels. That resulted in earnings that were the second highest ever.\n\nSure, record high lithium prices in the earlier part of 2023 are responsible for the success. That\u2019s inarguable. Yet, investors should also consider that Albemarle is entrenched in the continued growth of the EV sector and the ultimate rebound of lithium prices. It may take a while for things to swing back in its favor, but that is also a near inevitability.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock is relatively cheap at the moment. That low pricing is one of the major reasons to consider it right now. Investors broadly understand that global tensions could send oil prices much higher in the near term. That would make the domestic production out of firms like Exxon Mobil and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) much more valuable.\n\nBoth ExxonMobil and Chevron make sense as ultra-reliable dividend stocks to consider at the moment. However, I would give the slight edge to ExxonMobil.\n\nTo some, that may seem illogical given that Chevron\u2019s yield is higher by roughly 0.5%. Both firms last reduced their dividends all the way back in the 1980s. So both are ultra reliable. What gives Exxon Mobil the edge in my mind is that the company has consistently found a way to create more value than Chevron. ExxonMobil creates roughly 4.5% return from the capital it invests while Chevron creates almost zero percent return.\n\nBoth are ultra reliable but in my mind Exxon Mobil deserves the edge.\n\nAtmos Energy Corporation (ATO) Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant with sunset and light orange. Best natural gas stocks to buy.\n\nSource: Rangsarit Chaiyakun / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtmos Energy Corporation (NYSE:ATO) is a prime example of the notion that reliable dividend stocks to buy come from reliable sectors. The company is a natural gas distributor and operates from within the ultra-reliable utility sector. The company last reduced its dividend in 1983. It has also grown that dividend at an annual rate of 8.9% over the last 5 years.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a range of scenarios based on current analyst forecasts for Atmos Energy Corporation in consideration of its dividend. Currently, Atmos Energy Corporation\u2019s dividend amounts to $3.22 of extra return annually.\n\nShares currently trade for $112.50. The low analyst forecast for those shares is $110. Thus, those shares would return $113.22 with the dividend and an investor who bought today would still make a marginal return. That\u2019s a likely worst case scenario.\n\nAn alternative best case scenario is that shares rise to a value of $133. That would be worth $136.22 with dividends and a return of more than 18%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights S&P 500 Index ETF SPY, Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK and IBM IBM.\n\nThe Magic Elixir: Low Beta + Strong Outperformance (2 Stocks to Buy)\n\nWhat is the Advantage of Low Beta & Outperformance?\n\nA low-beta stock with strong out performance is ideal for investors seeking a balance between stability and high returns. Beta measures a stock\u2019s sensitivity to market fluctuations, and a low beta indicates lower volatility than the major indices like the S&P 500 Index ETF. When combined with strong outperformance, it suggests that the stock has delivered robust returns while exhibiting a relatively stable price movement.\n\nThis combination is attractive to investors looking for a less risky investment that still offers compelling returns, providing a level of protection during market downturns while capturing the benefits of the stock\u2019s superior performance. It aligns with a conservative investment strategy prioritizing both capital preservation and growth potential.\n\nDeckers Outdoor: A Best-in-Class Retailer\n\nFounded in 1973 and headquartered in California, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Deckers Outdoor Corp. is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities. DECK\u2019s products are sold through specialty domestic retailers, international distributors, and directly to end-users through its websites and catalogs.\n\nThe UGG brand makes up nearly 70% of revenues and has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear. However, the HOKA brand is gaining momentum and accounts for a growing slice of total revenues.\n\nConsistent Growth\n\nDespite the bear market of 2022, inflation concerns, and consumer credit concerns, DECK has delivered consistently growing earnings and sales. The company has been growing for at least a decade, showing that its core products are sticky and resilient with consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrozen Rope Uptrend + Low Beta\n\nDECK is working on its sixth monthly gain in a row, though it should be mentioned that the stock is still in a massive long-term. Investors should not try to predict when a trend will end but instead understand the trend is their friend. In addition, DECK\u2019s beta of 1.01 means it\u2019s about as volatile as the S&P, except shares are up 116% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is only up 27.8%!\n\nInternational Business Machines: An Underrated, Underappreciated AI Leader\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock IBM, or International Business Machines Corporation, is a multinational technology company that operates in various fields, including hardware, software, and services. IBM is renowned for its expertise in computing technology and has a strong focus on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company has developed and implemented AI solutions across diverse industries, leveraging advanced technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics. IBM's AI capabilities are exemplified by its Watson platform, which encompasses AI-driven applications for businesses, healthcare, and other sectors, demonstrating its commitment to advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence.\n\nWatson May Finally Bear Fruit\n\nIBM's Watson is a sophisticated artificial intelligence platform that incorporates machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics. Watson\u2019s ability to understand, reason, and learn from vast amounts of unstructured data makes it unique. Unlike traditional computer programs, Watson excels at processing and interpreting human language, allowing it to comprehend complex information and provide insightful solutions.\n\nWatson's uniqueness lies in its adaptability across diverse industries, offering applications in healthcare, finance, customer service, and more, making it a versatile and powerful tool for organizations seeking innovative AI solutions. IBM has been working on and refining Watson for years, but 2024 will be the year it finally bears fruit for investors. Also, a fun fact is that Watson competed in the popular game show Jeopardy and won both matches by an overwhelming amount \u2013 an impressive feat.\n\nA Consistent Overachiever\n\nIBM\u2019s recent EPS surprise history illustrates that Wall Street underestimates the big tech juggernaut. In fact, IBM has delivered positive EPS surprises in 18 of the past 20 quarters.\n\n\u201cTechno-Fundamentals\u201d Allow You to Gain an Edge\n\nI fancy myself as a techno-fundamentalist \u2013 in other words, I combine price action and fundamentals to gain an edge. IBM has both. IBM has a beta of just 0.7, and the daily chart shows a strong uptrend followed by the earnings-induced gap.\n\nAfter earnings on January 5, the stock jumped nearly 10% as volume swelled to 5x the norm. The robust price and volume action screams of institutional accumulation. Furthermore, the fact that price has held tight after the earnings gap makes it a top candidate for the post-earnings drift phenomenon witnessed in many stocks this year.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Could Trigger a Natural Gas Boom in Europe",
        "content": "When the use of seismic surveys became common place, Oil and gas drillers used to drill only in spots the human eye could detect from seismic and other data, but that\u2019s all changing now. The next round of onshore discoveries is being aided by new Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning software that sees what we can\u2019t, forever disrupting the exploration game.\n\nNowhere is this more urgent than in Europe\u2014a continent starved for domestic resources since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the weaponization of Russian natural gas.\n\nMachine Learning software capable of sampling large volumes of 3D seismic, breaking down wave forms to identify unique patterns, and revealing new targets for the drill bit that the human eye has never seen \u2026\n\nThat completely changes exploration.\n\nIt\u2019s been used around the world, and now, it\u2019s being deployed in Austria and Germany by junior explorer MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), the North American company that is the first to offer investors exposure to European natural gas since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nMCF saw the value of this technology early on and has used it extensively wherever possible in their search for gas in Europe, according to its CEO, James Hill.\n\nAnd for Germany, in particular, the timing is critical. Critical enough, in fact, that the EU has reclassified natural gas as \u201cGreen\u201d and sustainable.\n\nIf Germany fails to sustainably make up for its winding down of Russian natural gas domestically, high-priced LNG imports, delayed nuclear power phaseout and even restarting of dormant coal plants will be the outcome. Renewables cannot yet bridge the gap in the energy transition, and resorting to coal would set things back drastically for the climate.\n\nNatural Gas Paradise Beyond the Human Eye\n\nIn the past, humans only picked prospects to drill visually from the 3D seismic aided by visual hydrocarbon indicators in the data. Now, thanks to new software, they can drill in places they never would have before. AI and Machine Learning sees what we can\u2019t.\n\nStory continues\n\nMCF Energy has both\u2014the power of AI to see beyond the human eye, and prospects with a previously drilled\u00a0 well that produced gas in Austria, along with two previous discoveries in Germany. MCF has just started drilling at its\u00a0Welchau prospect in Austria. Welchau is a geologic structure you can see from space and covers about 100 sq km.\u00a0 An independent evaluation estimated potentially recoverable resources of some 100 million barrels of oil equivalent in an evaluation last year.\u00a0 A well drilled in the 80\u2019s found producible gas and condensate just south of the location being drilled, confirming the presence of gas in the area.\n\nWhen this 40-day drill is complete, MCF is planning to move the drill rig to Germany, where it will re-open an oil and gas play of over 110 square kilometers in the Lech and East Lech concessions, which have already seen two historical discoveries and three previously drilled wells at Lech.\n\nThey\u2019re not drilling blind, or with limitations of the human eye.\n\n\"The Machine Learning technology that MCF Energy is using allows for the computer to \u2018see\u2019 information within seismic data which the human eye cannot. This technology is a game changer and is only now being discovered by other operators,\u201d MCF Energy\u2019s Hill told Oilprice.com recently.\u00a0Using Paradise software, MCF Energy\u2019s key AI analyst, advisor Deborah Sacrey, has a prediction success rate of over 80% for drilling in areas that are not visual to humans on the data. She has 9 discoveries of this nature to her name, according to the company.\n\nSacrey, a geologist and geophysicist with 45 years of oil and gas exploration experience in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of the U.S., specializes in 2D and 3D seismic interpretation. She\u2019s the only one using Paradise for her clientele, and that\u2019s because she was one of its developers.\n\nParadise software isn\u2019t proprietary, but only a small field of experts have the ability to effectively use it, and MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF) has the advantage of having one of its developers on its advisory board.\n\nThe power of supercomputing has now reached the point of being able to sample data within a 3D seismic volume and break down the wave forms into over 50 \u201cneurons\u201d that each have different attributes of waves. Those \u201cneurons\u201d are then matched up to well information in both dry and producing wells. And comparing this treasure trove of data then yields a unique set of \u201cneurons\u201d that identify gas, oil, porosity and many other factors that control production.\n\nSource: Geoinsights.com\n\nAI scans the entire data set for those unique sets of \u201cneurons\u201d and identifies them on the map.\n\nParadise software, according to Sacrey, analyzes seismic data 15 times more densely than other existing software, and that allows it to distinguish very thin beds of deposition in the subsurface and see thin streaks of porosity that the human eye cannot.\n\nParadise\u2019s Fault Detection uses deep learning and machine learning to automatically detect faults, and generates attributes to extract meaningful geological information.\n\nState-of-the-art color-blending highlights geologic features, such as faults or stratigraphic features, in 3D.\n\nParadise software applies Self-Organizing Map (SOM) unsupervised machine learning to reveal stratigraphic facies and their distributions, and captures facies based on distinctive seismic patterns using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning technology.\n\nEstimating volumes of reserves, resources and geologic features, and comparing machine learning classification results and other seismic attributes to traditional well logs should help explorers like MCF get the drill bit in the right place faster, cheaper and much more efficiently.\n\nThis potentially gives MCF Energy a \u201cleg up\u201d when it comes to analyzing the areas to drill and helps to reduce risk in understanding the subsurface.\n\nHow AI Is Changing Exploration & Discovery\n\nThe oil and gas industry is AI\u2019s and Machine Learning\u2019s biggest cheerleader.\n\nThat\u2019s because the disruption these technologies creates and opens opportunities, which could turn into major upside. Forbes calls the changes \u201cprofound\u201d, noting that the world\u2019s top 20 oil and gas producers all have major AI strategies for every point along the chain.\n\nMordor Intelligence projected oil and gas spending on AI to close out 2023 at $2.38 billion, and to reach\u00a0$4.21 billion by the end of 2028.\n\nNew AI announcements come on a near-daily basis.\n\nShell\u2014the biggest producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico--will use\u00a0AI-based technology from big-data analytics company SparkCognition for deep sea exploration and production\u2014both to pinpoint where to drill and boost offshore production.\n\nAI could shorten exploration to less than nine days from nine months, the two companies said in a statement, with SparkCognition\u2019s Bruce Porter noting that \u201cgenerative AI for seismic imaging can positively disrupt the exploration process and has broad and far-reaching\u00a0implications\".\n\nBack in Europe, MCF is doing the same\u2014onshore, and on a continent that desperately needs to secure energy independence from Russia, without creating a secondary dependence on expensive American LNG.\n\nNow, as\u00a0MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF),\u00a0prepares for its first drill in Germany, it\u2019s armed with a significant AI and Machine Learning advantage for targeting drills in plays abandoned by supermajors decades ago, before Europe realized it couldn\u2019t survive on cheap Russian gas anymore.\n\nMCF\u2019s Lech prospect in Germany came with a modern 3D seismic survey of over 160 square kilometers of 3D seismic data to apply new Paradise Machine Learning technology to. \u201cUsing this,\u201d said Hill, \u201cwe were able to identify the gas-bearing zones precisely and compare them to the rest of the area. We compared the known gas-bearing area in Lech with the rest of the survey covering Lech East and identified multiple prospects with great potential.\u201d\n\nParadise\u2019s AI \u2013 Machine Learning Workbench distinguishes thin beds and Direct Hydrocarbon indicators while identifying and calibrating detailed stratigraphy and automatically detecting faults and revealing fracture trends. It also classifies seismic facies, isolates geobodies and calculates potential oil and gas volumes .\n\nMachine learning allows for the concise ability to reveal the natural gas targets and handle well placement to key zones with porosity and hydrocarbon potential identical to the proven areas, and MCF was one of the first companies to apply it to the entire exploration and development program, according to Hill.\n\n\u201cThis proven technique greatly reduces the risk in drilling and helps target the best possible places and depths to drill these wells,\u201d Hill said, adding that it has had a prediction success rate of over 80% when it comes to predicting the geology to identify previously unseen discoveries.\n\nBig Tech is Turning the Oil and Gas Sector on Its Head\n\nGoogle Cloud, a product of Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "For the most part, Reddit\u2019s picks from 2021 haven\u2019t panned out well at all over the long term. You probably aren\u2019t going to find any standout stocks in the same place where you are finding fail videos and extremist political ramblings. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), for example, closed at $4.36 on March 1, versus its 2021 high of nearly $500, while GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), finished at $14.95 on March 1, down from its 2021 high of $120.75. Another Reddit favorite from a few years ago, Bed, Bath and Beyond, even went bankrupt, while headphone maker Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) tumbled from its 2021 high of $127 to $2.50.\n\nEven Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) which has been relatively successful amid the resilience of crypto prices, is still trading well below its 2021 high of $369. Those stocks\u2019 track records show that, over the longer term, powerful fundamentals and huge opportunities win out over bursts of popularity that are completely unjustified by fundamentals and reality-based outlooks. With that in mind, here are three stocks to buy that will indeed climb over the long term because their issuing firms have excellent businesses and great, easily converted opportunities.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is benefiting a great deal from its focus on helping its customers implement AI and shift to a mix of public and private clouds. As a result, it\u2019s one of the best stocks to buy currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the firm\u2019s Watsonx AI platform is proving to be quite popular, with more than 150 enterprioses, including Citi (NYSE:C), NASA, and Samsung, using the system as of last July.\n\nFurthermore, IBM has since made the platform more appealing by partnering with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, AWS, to allow its customers \u201cto quickly and responsibly scale AI workloads by using a comprehensive stack of generative AI, which consists of Amazon Bedrock and IBM watsonx running on AWS Cloud and across hybrid cloud environments.\u00a0\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more organizations greatly increase their use of AI, the growth of the firm\u2019s Data & AI revenue will accelerate, Seeking Alpha columnist Uttam Dey recently predicted.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had more than its share of skeptics in recent weeks, as bears have questioned whether the firm\u2019s search engine can withstand challenges from AI chatbots and the answers provided by its own AI to certain questions offended some users.\n\nHowever, old habits are hard to break, so I predict that most users will continue to rely on Google\u2019s search engine for many years to come. Furthermore, according to a majority of sources, Alphabet\u2019s underlying AI technology is actually very strong.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tech giant, which had nearly $111 billion of cash as of the end of last quarter, can afford to make acquisitions and hire many experts to greatly improve the quality of its AI offerings over the longer term.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m confident that by 2030, Waymo will contribute considerable amounts to the firm\u2019s top and bottom lines.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputer network equipment maker Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 12, showing that it\u2019s benefiting meaningfully from the AI boom.\n\nThe firm\u2019s top line climbed by an impressive 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income rose to $513.6 million, up from $427.1 million in Q4 of 2022.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s most prolific customers are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), which are also two of the largest beneficiaries of the AI Revolution. As MSFT and Meta continue to get big boosts from their deployment of AI, Arista\u2019s financial results should continue to surge.\n\nAmong the 21 Wall Street analysts who cover the name, 13 rate it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and two have \u201cBuy\u201d ratings on it.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to advance to $7.59 this year and $8.56 next year from the $6.94 of EPS that it generated in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in COIN.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World.\n\nHumans are complex beings, gifted with a multitude of qualities-- some innate, others acquired through exposure. Precisely pinpointing a metric to measure their brilliance is a daunting task. The world is filled with awe-inspiring scientists who have shaped and reshaped our understanding of Earth, the cosmos and their multifarious dynamics, researchers who have brought forth astounding findings, politicians who have redrawn boundaries between countries and etched their mark in history, as well as artists and musicians who have brought immense pleasure to the world. The list of diverse accomplishments that humans can possess is endless. They are all stars, shining brilliantly in their respective domains.\n\nPreparing Generations of Brilliance\n\nThe students-- future pillars of all nations-- are unique individuals, each evolving along their path of knowledge. Over the years, significant emphasis has been placed on developing curricula that focus on critical thinking tools, participatory learning, and independent problem-solving techniques. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, in particular, has been hailed as the harbinger of future learning. Major countries like the US and Europe have predominantly incorporated it into their educational systems. However, with time, Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea, and Japan have also embraced this system. By 2020, China had emerged as the leading producer of STEM graduates, with 3.57 million, followed by India with 2.55 million and the US with 820,000 graduates.\n\nSTEM education is gaining even greater relevance in our technologically oriented world. The onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic and the global proliferation of educational apps have fostered an environment conducive to digital education. From 300,000 in 2011, the number of massive open online course learners has surged to 220 million in 2021. Additionally, numerous digital startups have emerged on the online education map, driven by the rise in US venture funding for Education Technology (EdTech). Notable companies, such as Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR), have played a pivotal role in this transformative landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) is an online platform that collaborates with over 300 universities and organizations, including prestigious institutions like Stanford, Duke, UC Berkeley, Dartmouth, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). The platform provides online courses, certifications, and degrees across various subjects. Aligning with the contemporary needs, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) CEO, Jeff Maggioncalda, explains how the company can assist students and professionals through adaptive and personalized learning experiences.\n\nResearch and Innovation Producing Brilliant Students\n\nWhile investing in strong schools and effective teaching tactics is crucial at the foundational level, the fast-paced, technologically oriented world demands an even greater emphasis on continuous research and upgrading. In the contemporary era, countries allocate millions to research to ensure rapid and up-to-date progress. The United States has emerged as the country with the highest spending on academic Research and Development (R&D). According to 2020 OECD data, the U.S. invested $81 billion in this sector, followed by Germany with $28 billion, the United Kingdom and Japan each with $20 billion, and France with $18 billion. The 27 European Union countries, including Germany and France, collectively spent $100 billion in the year 2020. American universities, like John Hopkins, University of California, San Francisco, and University of Pennsylvania, are spearheading the growth in the R&D sector. In 2022, R&D spending by academic institutions in the country reached $97.8 billion, marking an $8 billion increase from 2021. Thus, it is no wonder that the world\u2019s leading technologically innovative companies, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), are situated in the U.S.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a technology pioneer for two decades, stands as one of the most widely used social media platforms globally. Originating from the mind of a brilliant psychology student at Harvard, the company swiftly captured the world's attention and continues to do so. With innovation as the cornerstone of their success, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) recently entered into a collaboration with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Together, they have formed an industry group comprising more than 40 companies and organizations, aimed at establishing open-source artificial intelligence work. This initiative is designed to facilitate technology sharing and reduce associated risks. 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World\n\n20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World, we have used the H-Index of the papers published in all the subject areas from the period of 1996-2022. H-Index is a robust measure of scholarly impact. We present our list in ascending order of H-Index. If you want to delve into the details of what H-index is, please refer to the methodology section in our piece on 15 Countries That Produce the Best Engineers in the World. We also use the OECD's \"What Students Learn Matters: Towards a 21st Century Curriculum\", 2020 report to quote data for percentage of lower secondary school teacher who encourage use of critical thinking and problem solving in their students as well as the percentage of curriculum that embeds critical thinking and problem solving.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet us now take a look at our list for 20 Countries with Most Brilliant Students in the World.\n\n20. Finland\n\nH Index: 793\n\nFinland is renowned for having one of the best and most challenging education systems globally. While the early school years are relatively relaxed, the later years become progressively demanding, urging students to embrace a more application-oriented approach. Consequently, students in Finland excel in honing their acuity and thriving in creative endeavors. In 2022 alone, the country recorded 1,361 patent applications, and it boasts a high citation impact per paper, underscoring the quality of education that produces exceptionally brilliant students.\n\n19. India\n\nH Index: 795\n\nIndia has secured a prominent position in the rankings among 12 Asian countries with the best education systems, boasting 45 high-ranking universities that offer students crucial platforms for growth. Notably, 15 Indian universities have earned spots in the top 1000 Academic Ranking of World Universities for 2023.\u00a0 As one of the most promising innovators on the global stage, the Indian student body is evidently making strides in the creative realm, providing tangible proof of their academic brilliance.\n\n18. Austria\n\nH Index: 822\n\nAs a part of the highly advanced European region, Austria boasts a well-developed public education system, securing the 14th position in the global ranking of the best education systems.

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar AI Stocks With Long-Term Growth Plans",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market is full of hype and speculation, with early AI leaders like Nvidia or Microsoft trading at nosebleed valuations. Whether the AI market darlings deserve their rich valuations or not, three Fool.com contributors believe it's time to look beyond the usual suspects.\n\nThey put their heads together to uncover existing tech giants like International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), Cloudflare(NYSE: NET), and Salesforce(NYSE: CRM) -- three great companies with deep AI expertise. This trio offers compelling value and potentially significant long-term returns from their AI initiatives.\n\nInvesting is a marathon. IBM, Salesforce, and Cloudflare have been running the AI race for years, and they won't stop anytime soon.\n\nIBM is the big, blue AI workhorse\n\nAnders Bylund (IBM): Generative AI tools and flashy consumer tech often dominate the headlines. Meanwhile, good old tech titan IBM is quietly positioning itself as the backbone of enterprise-grade AI solutions.\n\nThe company's hybrid cloud focus, emphasis on explainability and trackable data sources, and deep industry relationships might not seem as sexy as the latest ChatGPT upgrade, but these are the very elements that should make IBM an enduring force in the AI space.\n\nIBM's focus on long-term partnerships and sustainable solutions aligns with the needs of businesses wanting to use AI in an impactful yet responsible way. As concern grows around AI systems' potential for harmful biases, misleading output, and black-box decision-making, IBM's approach inspires a deeper trust.\n\nThe long-term contracts Big Blue signs with enterprise-class customers will depend on that professional-grade trust. \"Hallucinations\" and data mishaps are common themes in today's large language models (LLMs), but IBM isn't interested in playing that game. The likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet don't seem ready to compete from the transparency and quality angle so far.\n\nStory continues\n\nCritics might argue that IBM's \"slow and steady\" approach is a disadvantage. But in the realm of enterprise solutions, patience and thoroughness should be seen as strengths. The slow and heavy vetting IBM's prospective clients apply to the Watson AI systems today will result in lucrative, hard-to-replace, multiyear contracts.\n\n\"The early work for clients around data architecture, security, and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here,\" CEO Arvind Krishna said in the recent fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMoreover, IBM's current valuation presents a potential value opportunity compared to some of the AI market's highfliers. The stock trades at a modest 2.7 times sales and 13 times free cash flow, making even Alphabet look expensive in comparison with the same ratios clocking in at 5.6 and 25, respectively.\n\nIf the company can continue to prove that its AI solutions add tangible, measurable value to businesses, investors who focus on long-term potential may find IBM to be the unsung workhorse of the AI revolution. If nothing else, you're looking at a generous dividend payer with torrential cash flows and a centennial business history.\n\nIBM's big AI bet is starting to pay off right now, but even if the business-grade AI strategy fizzles, it's still a great income-generating stock to own in the long run. That's a big \"if,\" though. AI and hybrid cloud computing have emerged as leading growth drivers for the ultra-experienced tech giant. I expect good things and big wins from Big Blue's AI business in the coming years.\n\nCould this edge computing play be an under-the-radar AI star?\n\nBilly Duberstein (Cloudflare): The past 18 months in artificial intelligence have been all about training, which is the act of building extremely large language models out of billions of data parameters. But now the AI industry is moving to an \"if you build it, they will come\" phase. In layman's terms, companies are now actually putting these models to work.\n\nWhen a trained model is prompted and then goes to work on finding answers or completing a task, that's called inferencing. And inferencing applications are about to take off.\n\nTo see how that shift is unfolding, look no further than Nvidia's recent earnings report. CEO Jensen Huang said he estimates about 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue over the past year was actually for inference, not training. That's somewhat surprising, as Nvidia is thought to be the only game in town for training, whereas it's possible inferencing could be done with some lower-power processors from competitors.\n\nOne company that could be an under-the-radar inference play is Cloudflare, which began as a software company that helped speed up websites, software applications, and content delivery.\n\nBut Cloudflare's management was forward-thinking, taking the time and cost to build an integrated software stack from the beginning, whereby all of its new products and services can be run on the same type of commodity hardware. That has paid off in the form of an ever-increasing portfolio of products, including cybersecurity, network management, and developer platforms that run on its lightweight servers in internet service provider data centers close to customers at the edge.\n\nToday, Cloudflare's servers are in 310 cities in over 120 countries connecting 13,000 networks, with its network now within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the world's population. And that makes Cloudflare a potentially ideal place for businesses to run their inference workloads. That's because inference workloads are likely too computing-intense to run on end devices such as PCs or phones, but are likely \"lightweight\" enough so that they don't have to be run all the way back in a large, cloud-based data center.\n\nManagement began to capitalize on this potential last September when Cloudflare released Workers AI, an inferencing-as-a-service platform for developers in Cloudflare's servers, which could potentially put Cloudflare up against the big cloud computing players for inference workloads.\n\nAnd the new offering is showing early signs of success, with Workers AI requests growing 9x between September and December, according to Cloudflare's recent fourth-quarter conference call with analysts. And even though the new inference offering just came out and contributes little to revenues today, Cloudflare still saw a very healthy 32% revenue growth in the last quarter, driven by its core products. Of note, Cloudflare is really penetrating larger enterprise customers now, with the company recording its largest customer win, as well as its largest customer renewal ever last quarter.\n\nWith much-loved offerings across its core content delivery, network, and cybersecurity markets that are still growing strong, Cloudflare's new inference products could bolster its already-strong growth rate for years to come.\n\nA transition from growth to value\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): After a couple of years of unwinding out-of-control spending that cropped up during the pandemic, customer data and relationship management platform Salesforce(NYSE: CRM) is totally back. The software giant reported revenue growth of 11% this past year, despite a big slowdown in corporate spending as companies looked to tighten up as the economy slowed. Salesforce is predicting some of this soft spending among its users will continue, but is still nevertheless predicting revenue growth of about 9% for 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Salesforce).\n\nAs the business has matured, Salesforce made a quick pivot from all-out growth (it had been putting up 20%-plus sales growth for the duration of its existence as a publicly traded stock over the last two decades) to a more value-generating business. CEO Marc Benioff and the top team ratcheted up generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating profit margins this last year to 14.4%, and expects that figure to jump to 20.4% for full-year fiscal 2025. CRM Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAlong the way, Salesforce started repurchasing its own stock as part of a new strategy to begin returning cash to shareholders. And starting this year, Salesforce will also begin paying a quarterly dividend -- which, as of this writing, is worth 0.5% in annualized yield. That's not too exciting, but it nevertheless signals this data management software company's successful evolution into a more mature business.\n\nOf course, customer data is more important than ever in a new era of AI-fueled computing technology. Salesforce's own development of AI throughout its platform isn't translating into any pick-up in growth just yet. However, that tees up the possibility of management underpromising and overdelivering this year on financial guidance. Plus, Benioff and company said its own internal use of its AI tools should fuel the profit margin expansion story for years to come.\n\nSalesforce stock now trades for about 45 times expected GAAP earnings per share (EPS), or about 30 times EPS on an adjusted basis (which corresponds a bit more closely to free cash flow). Shares have been on a hot run in the last year, but there are still years' worth of profitable returns left in the tank for this cloud software leader. I'm happy to keep holding.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Salesforce wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "While the golden years may be decades away for many of you, here\u2019s the thought process behind retirement stocks for new investors: they represent an inevitability.\n\nHonestly, the aging process may seem to take forever, especially if you\u2019re stuck in a rut climbing the career ladder. However, that might be a blessing in and of itself. When you\u2019re having fun, time just seems to fly. And before you know it, you\u2019re sitting around in a park bench bemoaning how things were different in your day.\n\nGiven that no one is going to escape Father Time \u2013 and eventually the Grim Reaper \u2013 you should think about these retirement stocks for new investors. Yes, it\u2019s a different name but it\u2019s very much the same game.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media platform and overall technology juggernaut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is everywhere these days. That\u2019s about as good a reason as any to target it as one of the retirement stocks for new investors. What may have started out as an idea in a dorm room has catapulted into a leading player in some of the most innovative sectors.\n\nLikely, the trend will only continue to rise. In many ways, META stock is the investment equivalent of sliced bread. While there are other social media networks available for users to choose, none commands the global reach and utility of Facebook. It\u2019s a platform you can grow old with, not age out of, which in my opinion is a risk factor impacting Snap (NYSE:SNAP).\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect investment \u2013 nothing is. And surely, I have big questions about the company\u2019s pivot to the metaverse. Nevertheless, that wart aside, Facebook will probably continue to rise in prominence. And its investments in areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality should pay off.\n\nLastly, its introduction of a dividend is a possible gamechanger. Analysts for good reason rate META stock a consensus strong buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nTo be blunt, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) might seem an incredibly odd idea for retirement stocks for new investors. As a tax consultancy firm, it\u2019s incredibly boring. However, this boring business is about to get exciting \u2013 at least on the relevancy front. It\u2019s all about the burgeoning gig economy.\n\nEarlier this year, Statista noted that in 2023, analysts projected that the gig economy could reach a market value of $455.2 billion. Looking ahead, analysts project that the space could expand to $918.94 billion by 2028. From levels seen in 2022, this trajectory would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.22%.\n\nHere\u2019s why HRB stock will likely become more important. Companies hire employees. In contrast, the gig economy fosters independent contractors. Stated differently, the tax profile is far different from employees to contractors. It\u2019s a sizable leap in complexity and filing requirements, potentially boosting demand for tax consultancy services.\n\nAnalysts rate H&R Block a hold with a $55 price target. I think this is ungenerous considering its forward relevance and dividend yield.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nAn aging tech giant, IBM (NYSE:IBM) recently had its 100th birthday. Before I receive emails regarding the nuances of Big Blue\u2019s origin, the name International Business Machines materialized in February 1924. In the present day, IBM doesn\u2019t seem a particularly enticing idea for retirement stocks for new investors. However, it may be time for a rethink.\n\nFor one thing, IBM stock has been on a surprisingly robust run. Since the beginning of the year, shares gained almost 15% of market value. In the trailing one-year period, they swung up almost 45%. While tech fans have coalesced around the usual suspects, Big Blue has been quietly reasserting itself as an innovator. After all, its Watson computer system \u2013 capable of answering questions posed in natural language \u2013 helped forward the concept of machine learning.\n\nFurther, because it has limited expectations, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see IBM stock continue its ascent. While other companies are latching onto digital intelligence, IBM has been pioneering this trend. Looking ahead, I see more practical applications arising from the Armonk, New York-based enterprise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While the equities sector roars higher, it\u2019s never a bad idea to consider stocks to buy for a down market. No, I\u2019m not prognosticating an imminent calamity. Rather, I just think it\u2019s smart to think ahead.\n\nEssentially, stocks to buy for a down market is Wall Street\u2019s equivalent of an emergency kit. You do have one of those, don\u2019t you? Because if you don\u2019t, you should get one. Sure, it might seem like a waste of time and money, especially if an emergency doesn\u2019t materialize. But that\u2019s the thing \u2013 unexpected calamities have a way of being, you know, unexpected.\n\nSimilarly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get uber-rich with these stocks to buy for a down market. However, should the red ink start flying, you\u2019re going to sleep easier buying these giants on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is now a more streamlined operation, having spun off its consumer health products division. While I have some reservations about the move, in the long run, it may unlock value for stakeholders prior to the spinoff. Looking ahead, though, J&J itself should benefit from rising permanent demand.\n\nAccording to Acumen Research and Consulting, the global pharmaceutical market reached a valuation of $1.5 trillion in 2022. Analysts anticipate that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2023 to 2032. At the forecast\u2019s culmination point, the industry should be worth $2.8 trillion.\n\nAnother factor benefiting JNJ as one of the stocks to buy for a down market is the value proposition. Even without a downcycle, shares trade at a modest trailing-year earnings multiple of 13.29X. If the red ink starts flying, JNJ should be more attractive.\n\nAnalysts view the company as a consensus moderate buy with a $177.67 price target, implying 10% upside potential.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nA soft-drink giant, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) makes for an ideal play for stocks to buy for a down market because of everyday relevance. Recently, a few major enterprises have demanded an ultimatum regarding work from home: either come back to the office or kiss your job goodbye. With this sharp pivot from the pandemic days, demand for caffeinated products should rise.\n\nAt the same time, consumers have struggled with years of high inflation and spiked borrowing costs. People are still opening their wallets but many sectors have indicated concerns about waning capabilities. So, demand for expensive coffeeshops might fade. Cynically, the trade-down effect should benefit KO stock. The underlying product is cheap (and necessary), thus offering a superior alternative.\n\nTo be sure, KO isn\u2019t exactly a sterling deal on paper. Nevertheless, it offers a forward dividend yield of 3.21%, combined with a payout increase going on 63 years. If you\u2019re looking for stocks to buy for a down market, it doesn\u2019t get much more trustworthy than Coca-Cola.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOrdinarily, I might go with another big-box retailer other than Target (NYSE:TGT) for stocks to buy for a down market. Yeah, I\u2019m talking about Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, Walmart seems more capable of withstanding a wider economic hit. Based on the latest consumer demographic data, Walmart shoppers tend to align with realistic income brackets.\n\nOn the other hand, Target tends to align with consumers within higher income levels. Nevertheless, they both provide one-stop shopping experiences that allow them to stay relevant in the age of e-commerce. Further, what I appreciate about TGT stock specifically is that it\u2019s more \u201ctechnically\u201d undervalued than WMT. The former security is up about 6% on a year-to-date basis while the latter gained over 12%.\n\nAlso, I can\u2019t overlook the better value proposition in terms of passive income. Right now, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 2.91%. On the other hand, WMT is comparatively miserly with a yield of 1.39%. Analysts rate Target a consensus strong buy, which seems reasonable.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nA similar investment to Target and Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) should also be on your radar for stocks to buy for a down market. Fundamentally, I appreciate COST stock for its viable consumer demographics. The main takeaway is that shoppers tend to be younger and more upwardly mobile. In other words, Costco\u2019s demo indicates that it starts at a high point and is only rising.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint \u2013 especially in a segment that overlaps with the broader discretionary retail space \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can ask for much better. Now, here\u2019s the thing with COST stock: I wouldn\u2019t buy it at this juncture. Rather, if the market gives you a sizable dip because of some disastrous economic event, Costco is a name to pick up on the cheap.\n\nSome ideas you simply don\u2019t trust when the red stains emerge. That\u2019s because their questionable business models become even more suspect under sever economic duress. But Costco? The retailer has weathered multiple storms. Further, it enjoys natural insulation because of its educated, higher-wage-earning members.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWhen it comes to stocks to buy for a down market, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is an \u201cOG\u201d stock. That\u2019s slang for \u201coriginal gangster\u201d or \u201cgangsta\u201d if you\u2019re really cool. Basically, Big Blue is an authentic, old-school technology investment. While everybody\u2019s been going gaga over enterprises like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for facilitating artificial intelligence, IBM has been doing AI since most of you were born.\n\nAfter years of languishing in the shadows, it appears that the legacy tech juggernaut is finally receiving some dues. It\u2019s not enough. However, I\u2019m sure long-embattled stakeholders will take a 15% pop to start 2024. Also, in the past 52 weeks, IBM stock gained almost 45%.\n\nIf you peruse IBM-related stories on InvestorPlace, I\u2019ve been pounding my fist on the table for a reason. While other companies may be playing cute games with digital intelligence, IBM has been forwarding real solutions. So, I trust that if heaven forbid a severe downturn impacts the market, I can trust Big Blue on any dips.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother major tech giant with a long history, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the contemporary beneficiaries of the AI boon. Since the start of January, MSFT stock gained just under 10% of market value. In the past 52 weeks, it shot up almost 66%. With everyone still head over heels regarding digital intelligence, Microsoft may continue to rise.\n\nHowever, if the market suffers some indigestion, MSFT would easily rank among the stocks to buy for a down market. It\u2019s not just about the AI investments, which has proven fruitful. However, the utility of generative AI is questionable at this moment. What\u2019s not questionable? Microsoft\u2019s dominance in most other areas of productive technologies.\n\nFor example, the business world might implode without Microsoft\u2019s suite of office products. Programs like Word and Excel \u2013 though they do have their quirks and issues \u2013 remain indispensable. Further, the company dominates the PC operating system market environment.\n\nIf you want to draw some cute pictures, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be a better bet. For everything else, there\u2019s Microsoft. It\u2019s a strong buy for a reason.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be 100% clear, if you\u2019re looking for a discounted opportunity, buying tech and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) right now is a tricky proposition. Just at a glance, you\u2019re talking about a security that\u2019s traded at a near-60X trailing-year earnings multiple. Not only that, the forward earnings multiple isn\u2019t that much better at 41X. Still, if the red ink starts flying, AMZN should be on your watch list.\n\nIt\u2019s real simple: the company has reached a knowledge-saturation point where it\u2019s likely impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. With Amazon users enjoying the everyday convenience of product and food delivery, less incentive exists to shop in person. More than that, the company\u2019s controversial role as the vacuum cleaner of small businesses everywhere has succeeded in one critical element: fostering effective economies of scale.\n\nThat might help to explain why even in an ecosystem impacted by stubbornly high inflation and interest rates, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales continues to rise since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense until you realize the (evil) genius behind Amazon. Clearly, it\u2019s one of the stocks to buy for a down market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon.com, American Express, International Business Machines, Microsoft and The Travelers Companies",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, American Express Co. AXP, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop 5 Blue-Chip Stocks for a New-Look Dow 30\n\nThe Dow Index \u2013 popularly known as Wall Street's blue-chip index \u2013 has a new look since the beginning of trading on Feb 26. The restructuring of the 30-stock index resulted in the exit of medical-retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance and the entry of the e-commerce super-giant Amazon.com Inc..\n\nThe restructuring was initiated after the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT) decided on a 3-to-1 stock split. Unlike the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 the Dow is a price-weighted index and not a market-capital-weighted index.\n\nDow's New Look\n\nThe Dow, which started its journey in May 1896, is always inclined toward old-economy cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and oil-energy. However, its peers have more representation from growth sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary.\n\nAs a result, the blue-chip index under performs its peers. In 2023, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.3%, 7.1%, and 8.6%, respectively.\n\nInclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index's exposure to new-economy stocks. Broadly, Amazon is categorized as a consumer discretionary company. However, its massive adoption of high-end technologies compelled a large-section of financial analysts to categorize it as a technology bigwig.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's entry will significantly increase the exposure of the blue-chip index in the e-commerce, consumer retail and technology space. Amazon's weight in the Dow will rank 17th out of the 30 stocks. Walmart's weight will drop to 26 from 17. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) will remain the most heavily weighted stock on the Dow.\n\nDow Likely to Gather Momentum\n\nOn Feb 23, the Dow recorded its all-time highs of 39,282.28 on an intraday basis and 39,131.53 on a closing basis. Technically, at its current level of 38,972.41, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 38,027.55 and 35,253.78, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.\n\nHistorically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from Prime and AWS momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to the performance of AWS. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. Moreover, AMZN's robust advertising business contributed well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continues to act as a tailwind. AMZN's strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nAmerican Express Co. has benefited from growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances. Consumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AXP, is advancing well. AXP's balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\n\nZacks Rank #2 American Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 14.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. is likely to benefit from the rising demand of its hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Increased watsonx adoption by clients is a tailwind. IBM's collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow generation of IBM provides the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.\n\nZacks Rank #2 International Business Machines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.1% and 4.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT were driven by the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last seven days.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners' insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV's commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at profitable agencies like auto and homeowners business. Strong and reliable returns from the growing fixed-income portfolio should drive net investment income. Sufficient capital boosts shareholder value. TRV aims for a mid-teens core return on equity over time.\n\nZacks Rank #2 The Travelers Companies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.8% and 34.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "7 A-Rated Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Before Q1 Ends",
        "content": "You may be short-sighted if you think generative artificial intelligence is the best thing happening to technology stocks this decade. There also are great opportunities right now in A-rated quantum computing stocks.\n\nQuantum computing will surely change the computer industry as we know it. It will be the next great breakthrough in technology. Quantum computing uses computer hardware and algorithms to use quantum mechanics to solve problems that classic computers can\u2019t touch.\n\nSimply put, classic computers operate on chips that use bits for computations. The bits can show either a value of zero or one and a combination of zeros and ones used to complete tasks in modern computers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut quantum computers operate at subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons. Quantum bits allow these particles to exist in more than one state (zero or one) simultaneously, greatly increasing processing speeds.\n\nQuantum hardware is relatively new (roughly three decades) but we\u2019re just now starting to see some inroads in everyday computing. According to a Zapata survey, more than two-thirds of companies with revenues of $250 million and computing budgets of at least $1 million are spending more than $1 million yearly to develop quantum computing applications.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader analyzed quantum computing stocks with the best fundamentals, earnings performance and momentum today. These are the best of the best A-rated quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nHere are seven that all get \u201cA\u201d ratings in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is perhaps the most established of the quantum computing companies.\n\nIn 2016 it put the first quantum processor on the cloud, which made it possible for anyone to run experiments. In 2019, it launched the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, the Quantum System One.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe innovations keep coming. Its first universal quantum computer with over 1,000 qubits rolled out in 2023, as well as new modular quantum processors.\n\nIn December it announced Quantum System Two, its first modular quantum computer that it calls \u201cthe cornerstone of IBM\u2019s quantum-centric supercomputing architecture.\u201d\n\nIBM has deep pockets for this research, which will surely continue to pay off down the road. The company has a market cap of nearly $170 billion and more than $13 billion of cash on hand to pour into research. And the stock is doing well, up 42% in the last year on the strength of $17.4 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago.\n\nIBM stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gets a lot of publicity and credit for its work in generative AI and its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. But its work with quantum computing is equally impressive.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure Quantum is a cloud service that allows users to build and refine quantum algorithms. It includes tools to accelerate scientific discovery, as well as to use natural language to work through chemistry and materials sciences problems.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s advanced work with AI is notable when you consider the potential of quantum computing. As Forbes writes, \u201cQuantum computing, an entirely new way of processing information, when combined with AI, has the potential, without exaggeration, to bring about a new computing revolution. Transformation may be an understatement.\u201d\n\nMSFT stock is up 60% in the last 12 months and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) already is staking its claim as the most influential stock of the decade.

        "title": "Get Paid While You Wait: 7 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now",
        "content": "The stock market bulls are charging right now. The Federal Reserve appears set to lower interest rates this year, which could stoke equity markets. Meanwhile, the emergence of AI has powered tech stocks higher.\n\nHowever, some analysts are worried that this rally could come crashing down. Given high valuation multiples on many leading momentum stocks right now, this is a tricky time to put capital to work.\n\nThe good news, though, is that there are still plenty of good investment opportunities for long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne great hunting ground is in Dividend Aristocrats. These are the companies that have increased their dividend payments for 25 or more years in a row. This record proves that these firms can prosper regardless of broader economic and political conditions. And these seven are at attractive valuations today, making great entry points for these Dividend Aristocrats to buy.\n\nEmerson Electric (EMR) An office building with an Emerson Electric sign on it.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) has historically been an industrial company focused on electrical equipment. The company was among the first to produce industrial fans, sewing machines, and power tools among others.\n\nIn recent years, Emerson has evolved its business. Seeing the possibilities in the factories of tomorrow, Emerson has leaned heavily into the industrial automation space. It is now a leader in engineering and software solutions to make factories operate in a leaner and more efficient manner.\n\nEmerson increasingly looks like the future of industrial automation. Despite being in a highly valued fast-growing market, however, EMR stock is going for just 20 times forward earnings. That plus its steadily increasing dividend makes this a great blue-chip pick for long-term investors.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Warren Buffett\u2019s latest annual letter, he highlighted carbon capture as a significant investment opportunity. He was specifically mentioning his firm\u2019s investment in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) in that discussion. However, Occidental ran itself into trouble by overly leveraging its business and thus required Buffett\u2019s funds to turn things around.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor investors that want a more stable way to play the next generation of energy technology \u2014 including carbon capture \u2014 there\u2019s Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). Exxon has been a stalwart blue chip over the decades, being one of the only companies to maintain a triple-A credit rating while investing in all sorts of new opportunities and fields within the energy space.\n\nThose new opportunities include carbon capture. Exxon acquired Denbury Resourceslast year. In doing so, it gets access to Denbury\u2019s massive network of carbon sequestration assets. Exxon is now the country\u2019s largest owner of CO2 pipelines and it is now positioned to be able to reduce said CO2 emissions by up to 100 million metric tons per year.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) was long the king in hardware solutions for the information technology sector. Its mainframe computers were the backbone of many Fortune 500 enterprises for decades.\n\nHowever, IBM largely missed the evolution to more modern tech solutions. IBM failed to make a dent in modern operating systems, PCs, smartphones or the like. Many investors dismissed IBM as a dinosaur heading into the 2020s.\n\nBut IBM has continued to invest heavily in R&D. It is always among the world\u2019s leading developers of new patents. And some of this new technology is coming in handy. IBM\u2019s long-running investments in AI systems such as Watson now appear to pay off in spades. And IBM\u2019s efforts in the fast-moving quantum computing space are gaining momentum as well.\n\nIBM has definitely missed a lot of opportunities over the years. But its robust balance sheet and research-driven focus has given it plenty of shots on goal. And some of these are now paying off. This shows the power of a blue-chip Dividend Aristocrat; they are generally able to get back on track and return to prosperity even after some strategic missteps.\n\nFor IBM, things are looking up once again, and income investors appreciate the firm\u2019s 3.6% dividend yield.\n\nBecton Dickinson (BDX) The front of a Becton Dickinson (BDX) office in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBecton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) is a leading health care and medical devices company. The firm is well-known for making basic medical implements such as syringes and catheters.\n\nIn recent years, it has made a series of acquisitions which has pushed out into more markets. Some of these other businesses have hit some obstacles.\n\nThere was a major recall with its diabetes pumps. Some COVID-19 related revenues have naturally declined from their prior peak levels. And the Chinese medical devices market is in a slump at the moment, which has dinged Becton Dickinson\u2019s results.\n\nBut the pessimism is overblown. BDX shares are now at 19 times forward earnings, which is a considerable discount to where this high-quality business has often traded in the past.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s Alex Morozov agrees that BDX stock is at a deep discount right now. Morozov believes the stock has a fair value of $325 per share, whereas shares are currently available for less than $250 each.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) is an American manufacturing powerhouse. The firm has more than 85,000 employees and produces thousands of unique products across a dizzying area of fields ranging from safety helmets to automotive repair tools, dental equipment, adhesives, and dozens of others.\n\nMMM stock has been in the doghouse over the past five years. It has slumped amid supply chain issues, slow organic growth, and a variety of product liability lawsuits.\n\nNone of this is good news, of course. But with shares down by more than half from their all-time highs, MMM stock is at a big discount. The company has not only maintained but continued to grow its dividend in the interim. Shares go for less than ten times forward earnings and offer a 6.5% dividend yield.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the leading developers of renewable power in America.\n\nThe company has long taken advantage of Florida\u2019s sunny weather and fast-growing economy to deploy solar power at a rapid clip. This has been a highly profitable operation, and NEE stock has historically outperformed most utility rivals.\n\nHowever, the utility sector has entered a slump. Higher interest rates have made it more costly to finance new projects. And investors have dumped firms with heavy exposure to renewables given increasing concerns around the economics on some wind and solar projects. But, given NextEra\u2019s strong track record, investors should give it in the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn fact, this is a particularly advantageous point for buying shares of discounted utility companies such as NextEra. Between higher interest rates and the slump in the renewables market, and many utility shares are selling near their lowest valuations in many years. Morningstar\u2019s Andrew Bischof believes fair value for NEE stock is $74/share compared to its current $57 quotation.\n\nSherwin-Williams (SHW) A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nSherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) is one of America\u2019s leading paint purveyors.\n\nAt a glance, paint may not sound like an interesting business. But this is actually a secret weapon for many Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nBecause paint is a mature established market, it long ago consolidated to just half a dozen or so key players. Technological disruption is minimal; paint as a product remains the same from year to year. And because it is a built-out industry, there is really much in the way of new competitive threats either.\n\nLong story short, Sherwin-Williams has been able to use its considerable market share and leading presence with professional painters to earn outsized profits. To put a number on it, SHW stock has run up roughly 30,000% since 1984. And it pays an ever-growing dividend on top of that as well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in IBM, XOM, BDX, MMM, and EMR stock.

        "content": "IBM's robust hybrid cloud and AI platforms position it as a leader in technological innovation. Strategic partnerships with industry giants bolster IBM's competitive edge. Global economic conditions and rapid technological changes present significant challenges. IBM's commitment to R&D and a strong brand identity remain key to its market leadership.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with IBM.\n\nOn February 26, 2024, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a company deeply integrated into the global IT infrastructure. With operations in 175 countries and a workforce of approximately 350,000, IBM's influence spans across a multitude of sectors. The company's financial performance is a testament to its strategic positioning, with a market capitalization of $121.9 billion as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter. IBM's financial tables indicate a company that is not only sustaining its current operations but is also investing in future growth through R&D and strategic partnerships. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview for investors and stakeholders. Decoding International Business Machines Corp (IBM): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nTechnological Leadership and Innovation: IBM's commitment to innovation is evident in its significant investments in R&D, which have cemented its position as a leader in hybrid cloud and AI technologies. The company's ability to leverage these advancements has enabled it to offer differentiated solutions that address complex business challenges. IBM's technological leadership is further reinforced by its extensive patent portfolio, which protects its innovations and provides a competitive advantage in the market.\n\nGlobal Brand and Market Presence: IBM's brand is one of the most recognized in the world, synonymous with reliability and innovation. This strong brand identity, coupled with the company's global presence, allows IBM to maintain and grow its customer base. The company's market leadership is reflected in its ability to service 95% of all Fortune 500 companies, manage a significant portion of the world's credit card transactions, and connect half of all wireless communications.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic Partnerships: IBM's strategic partnerships with other industry leaders, such as Adobe, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft, enhance its ability to deliver comprehensive solutions to clients. These alliances not only extend IBM's market reach but also provide avenues for collaborative innovation, keeping the company at the forefront of technological advancements.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Global Economic Conditions: IBM's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Downturns in the economy or shifts in client spending can significantly impact the company's revenue and profitability. As such, IBM must continuously adapt to changing market dynamics to sustain its business growth.\n\nChallenges in Rapid Technological Evolution: The rapid pace of technological change presents a challenge for IBM to maintain its innovation leadership. The company must constantly evolve its offerings and anticipate market trends to stay ahead of competitors, including new entrants that may disrupt the industry with innovative solutions.\n\nIntellectual Property Protection: While IBM has a robust intellectual property portfolio, there is no guarantee that it will prevent competitors from developing similar technologies. Additionally, the company faces the risk of aggressive patent enforcement by third parties, which could impact its ability to protect its technological advancements.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion into Emerging Technologies: IBM is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging technologies such as quantum computing. By continuing to invest in these areas, IBM can open new markets and create additional revenue streams, further solidifying its position as an industry leader.\n\nGrowth in Cloud Computing and AI: The growing demand for cloud computing and AI solutions presents a significant opportunity for IBM. The company's expertise and established platforms in these domains can drive increased adoption among enterprises seeking to undergo digital transformations.\n\nIncreasing Demand for Cybersecurity: As cybersecurity becomes a critical concern for businesses worldwide, IBM's capabilities in security software and services position it to meet this rising demand. The company's focus on security as a core component of its offerings could lead to greater market share in this expanding sector.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition: IBM operates in a highly competitive industry, facing challenges from both established players and new entrants. The company must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market position against competitors that are also investing heavily in technology and seeking to capture market share.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks: IBM is subject to a complex web of regulations across the various markets it operates in. Changes in laws, particularly those related to data privacy, intellectual property, and environmental impact, could impose additional compliance costs and affect the company's operations.\n\nGlobal Political and Economic Uncertainty: IBM's global operations expose it to risks associated with political and economic instability in the countries where it operates. Trade disputes, tariffs, and sanctions could disrupt IBM's supply chain and increase operational costs, potentially impacting its financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) stands as a paragon of innovation and technological prowess in the IT industry. Its strengths lie in its robust R&D capabilities, global brand recognition, and strategic partnerships. However, the company must navigate weaknesses such as its sensitivity to global economic conditions and the challenges posed by rapid technological evolution. Opportunities for growth are abundant, particularly in emerging technologies and the expanding demand for cloud computing and AI solutions. Nonetheless, IBM must remain vigilant against threats from intense competition, regulatory changes, and geopolitical uncertainties. The company's forward-looking strategies, including investments in quantum computing and cybersecurity, demonstrate its commitment to maintaining its leadership position and driving future growth.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A potential tax benefit is spurring US companies including PepsiCo Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. to sell bonds through their Singapore subsidiaries, fueling a record surge of sales from borrowers in the city state.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Stock Rally Stalls at Start of Data-Packed Week: Markets Wrap Freddie Mercury\u2019s London Residence Lists at \u00a330 Million Jacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87 Poland\u2019s Famously Frank Top Diplomat Lands a Blow With Rebuff of Russia\n\nThe tactic can allow companies to deduct interest expense from their taxable income in both the US and Singapore. That double deduction means that effective borrowing costs \u2014 after taxes \u2014 can be materially lower than they would be with a bond issued in the US.\n\nThe mechanics of qualifying for the benefit are complicated and a rule that emerged from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in December may wind up stopping firms from using the technique. But companies may be able to take advantage of it for at least the next three years.\n\nAs companies sell bonds, they are pushing debt sales volume from Singapore ever higher. Last year, corporates sold $51.5 billion of notes from the city state, more than double the previous year and an all-time record. That mainly came from Pfizer Inc.\u2019s sale of $31 billion of bonds, one of the biggest corporate bond offerings on record, in May 2023 through a Singapore unit to help finance an acquisition.\n\nThe sales have continued this year: PepsiCo Singapore Financing sold $1.75 billion of bonds earlier this month, and IBM International Capital sold $5.5 billion of securities in late January.\n\nA spokesperson for IBM declined to comment. PepsiCo and Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNew global tax rates are taking shape through the OECD to ensure minimum tax corporate rates are levied globally. Singapore domestic tax law allows a company, including a local subsidiary of a foreign corporation, to deduct interest payments on debt from their taxable income in the nation state. At the same time, the US tax code might allow companies to deduct a foreign branch\u2019s interest expense from its US taxable income.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Finbarr Flynn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations The High Cost of Eating Out in America Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)\n\nWithin the sector, among surveyed IT Professionals, 33% are focusing AI projects on HR/Talent Acquisition and 27% are focused on AI Monitoring & Governance. The findings are from IBM's Global AI Adoption Index 2023 global study* administered by Morning Consult and commissioned by IBM, based on interviews with 2,342 IT Professionals at enterprises located across 20 countries.\n\nThis new data echoes insights from the IBM Institute for Business Value's 2023 study, 'CEO decision-making in the age of AI,' which also interviewed 420 Energy & Resources CEOs thinking around AI. The fresh analysis of the Industry C-suite data shows that:\n\n63% Energy & Resources CEOs surveyed are more likely than their global peers to expect to realize value in the next three years from generative AI and automation 61% of CEOs surveyed express concerns about the sources of data used in generative AI\n\nWhen considering the impact of transformational technologies, Energy Industry CEOs surveyed appear to place Generative AI first in terms of expected value. To help the industry chart a path forward to realize the value of generative AI, at Distributech 2024, the leading annual transmission and distribution event, IBM at booth#2743 today showcased watsonx - its enterprise ready AI and data platform.\n\nImportantly, to help, Energy & Resources companies to navigate data-related challenges, including unclear data calculation and, critically, a lack of insights, IBM is highlighting its watsonx.governance toolkit for AI governance\u00a0which allows a Utility company to direct, manage and monitor its AI\u00a0. It employs software automation to strengthen a company's ability to mitigate risks,\u00a0manage\u00a0regulatory requirements and address ethical concerns for both generative AI and machine learning\u00a0models. While\u00a0not\u00a0all models are\u00a0created\u00a0equal, every\u00a0model should have governance to drive responsible\u00a0and ethical\u00a0decision-making\u00a0throughout\u00a0the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nCasey Werth, Global Energy Industry General Manager IBM said, \"Energy & Utility CEOs have moved beyond experimentation with AI to focusing on where they can drive the most business value with AI. As they manage ongoing transformation efforts they can also capitalize on the great opportunities of generative AI and foundation models.\u00a0 In doing so they need to remember to focus on their own data, how it is gathered, accessed and used within their workflows along with the governance that should be baked into their tools and processes.\"\n\nA good example of how Utility companies can tap large language models is to augment their internal compliance process. For a Utility company this can allow them to automate and align internal compliance processes to their specific business needs. For example, a utility can:\n\nProvide a single repository of obligation management to classify complex requirements. Enable their organization to govern their environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs and sustainability. Track provenance and document model performance against key performance indicators determined by the business. Provide visibility to key stakeholders through dynamic, user-based dashboards, charts and dimensional reporting.\n\nAt #DISTRIBUTECH24, IBM has several executive speaking sessions designed to help show how the industry can digitally transform at pace. Topics include; Quantum in the Energy Sector, Digitally Managing Emergency Response & Mobilization, Digital Twin for advanced and predictive Load Management, Preparing the Grid for tomorrow, Applying weather & climate risk analytics to create more sustainable and resilient grids. IBM's Energy CTO Bryan Sacks, will also lead an industry roundtable focused on AI for Grid Management discussing how companies in the energy and utilities industry are thinking about AI, use cases, policy and governance.\n\nThe full IBM Institute for Business Value 2023 \u00a0CEO Study can be accessed here, data on the specific Energy & Resources cuts of the data are available on request.\n\n* Methodology: IBM's Global AI Adoption Index 2023 global study administered by Morning Consult and commissioned by IBM was conducted from Nov. 8 \u2013 23, 2023 among a sample of 2,342 IT Professionals at enterprises (organizations with > 1,000 employees) in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, UAE, UK, US and LATAM (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Colombia)\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

        "title": "2 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "The stock market can be nerve-wracking at times, especially in the volatile tech sector. Wall Street may be in the midst of a fresh bull market, but there's still a lot of turbulence to deal with. But there's a handy shortcut available if you're looking for investments with the business-growth promise of exciting tech stocks and the long-term stability of a blue-chip business titan.\n\nThe trick is to look for solid dividends. Even in Silicon Valley, a generous dividend suggests robust cash profits and a relatively calm stock chart. By virtue of pure mathematics, dividend yields fall when stock prices are skyrocketing, so a strong payout leads you away from overly expensive stocks. On the flip side of the same equation, you're not looking for extremely high yields which typically spring from deep share price dives.\n\nAnd on that note, I see a couple of top-quality tech stocks with dividends in the Goldilocks zone -- just right for starting a low-risk tech investment right now. Let me show you why International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) and Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) tick all the right boxes for dividend investors in February 2024.\n\n1. IBM: 3.6% dividend yield\n\nBig Blue invariably comes to mind whenever I think about a solid commitment to dividend payouts. IBM's unbroken streak of annual dividend increases started with a 40% boost in January of 1996. The split-adjusted quarterly payouts have increased from $0.063 to $1.66 per share, which works out to a 28-year gain of 2,560%: IBM Dividend Chart\n\nThe dividend boosts have been modest since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but those symbolic increases never stopped. Even better, the dividend checks were always directly funded by free cash flows, with the cash-based payout ratio topping out at 85% in the inflation crisis of 2022.\n\nEven, even better, Big Blue is finally reaping the rewards of a strategy shift that started more than a decade ago. The IBM you see today has reshaped its business model with a laser-like focus on high-growth markets such as data security, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nStory continues\n\nYeah, you heard me. IBM has not-so-quietly built a world-class business around its Watson AI platform. The company was a little late to the AI boom since it takes its enterprise-class clients a while to run new solutions through testing and management approvals, but the financial benefits have started to trickle in.\n\nSo IBM gives you generous, cash-backed dividends alongside a highly promising future of high-margin AI services. Not too shabby, right? And the only clue needed to arrive at this incredible investment today was that juicy but still affordable 3.6% dividend yield.\n\n2. Intel: 1.2% dividend yield\n\nLet's shift gears without leaving the neighborhood. Intel's semiconductor fortunes have been intertwined with IBM's software and systems since the beginning of time (in terms of the fast-moving tech sector, anyway).\n\nIntel's dividend chart is less pristine, but for good reason. You see, the tech titan is pulling every available lever to expand its chip-making capacity, building and boosting manufacturing facilities around the world. This effort involved a steep dividend cut in 2023, rising debt balances, and accepting a few quarters of negative cash flows. INTC Dividend Chart\n\nIn return, Intel now runs one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing services for other chip designers. That's a sharp strategy shift, taking advantage of the Biden administration's CHIPS Act and a long-running global shortage of chip-building capacity.\n\nToday, Intel's stock gives you a different kind of hardware giant whose negative cash flows should spring back from the red-ink bath over the next couple of years. Playing an infrastructure role in this AI-driven era of high demand for memory chips and number-crunching processors could be a genius move in the long run, to the point where it almost looks like Intel's management saw the AI frenzy coming from a mile away. The timing is just too perfect.\n\nOh, and Intel's dividend yield peaked just below 6% before the payout cuts. That's uncomfortably high, especially when the company needs extra cash for business-building purposes. The current yield of 1.1% is on the low side of that just-right zone but still respectable enough. And again, this reasonable yield is a good starting point for a deeper stock analysis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "22 Careers with the Best Job Security",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 22 careers with the best job security. We have also discussed some emerging job threats around the globe. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Careers with the Best Job Security.\n\nWhat is Security in a Career?\n\nSecurity in a job refers to the assurance of stability, protection, and continuity in one's professional career. It encompasses various aspects such as job stability, financial security, and safeguarding of personal information. A secure career provides a sense of confidence and peace of mind that also minimize risks of unemployment, financial hardships, or privacy breaches.\n\nHowever, many individuals are not feeling a sense of career stability, with widespread concern about job security prevailing. A survey conducted by BCW across 15 countries, polling 13,488 individuals, revealed that 52% of respondents prioritize job security above all else.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that executives tend to show the highest concern regarding job security, as 66% expressed this worry in 2023. Importantly, entry-level workers display the largest spike in anxiety, with a 91% rise compared to the previous year, affecting nearly half of this demographic. Overall, there's a 49% increase in job security apprehension across all surveyed levels, reflecting widespread unease amidst shifting employment landscapes.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: The Dreadful Threat to Job Security\n\nEmployees are increasingly apprehensive about the rise of AI in the workplace, fueled by alarming statistics. Reports indicate that AI capabilities have doubled since 2018, with projections suggesting one-third of all jobs could be automated by the mid-2030s. Surveys reveal that 69% of workers fear losing their jobs due to AI growth, while 74% predict AI will render human workers obsolete. This worry is most pronounced in industries like IT, manufacturing, and healthcare. Despite some acknowledging AI's potential benefits, such as improved recruitment processes, the prevailing sentiment among employees is one of concern over job security and the potential displacement of human workers.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s CEO Arvind Krishna has announced a hiring freeze with expectations that around 7,800 positions will be replaced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the near future. Krishna highlighted that approximately 30% of the company's non-customer-facing roles, equating to about 26,000 workers, could be automated within the next five years. This decision follows International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s recent reduction of around 5,000 positions in other departments.\n\nSpeaking of the company, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) also issued a stringent ultimatum, mandating US managers to report to offices or client locations three days a week, regardless of their current remote work status. Those unable to commute must relocate within 50 miles of an IBM office by August. The directive aims to promote in-person interactions, aligning with CEO Arvind Krishna's emphasis on its productivity benefits. Non-compliant managers face separation from the company, reflecting International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) prioritization of in-office collaboration.\n\nIs AI Creating or Destroying Jobs?\n\nA report by UN emphasized that while automation would impact job quality, job destruction would be limited, particularly in occupations like clerical work, with nearly a quarter of tasks highly exposed and more than half with medium-level exposure. The effects of technology would vary across professions and regions, with higher-income countries experiencing the greatest impact, where 5.5% of total employment is potentially exposed to automation, compared to only 0.4% in low-income countries. Additionally, women would be disproportionately affected due to their overrepresentation in clerical roles, especially in high and middle-income countries.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has recently decided to hire 3,300 new employees which is an active response following its January layoff of 8,000 staffers. This strategic decision indicates a shift towards promoting innovation and sales efforts, particularly in the context of generative AI. The company actively focuses on integrating these cutting-edge features into its products, such as the Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Data Cloud, demonstrating a proactive approach to staying at the forefront of technological developments.\n\nFurthermore, with plans to restore nearly 40% of the previously downsized workforce, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is actively addressing immediate staffing needs while positioning itself for future growth and innovation. 22 Careers with the Best Job Security\n\nCopyright: zimmytws / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the careers with the best job security, we relied on the growth rates of jobs in the US between 2022 and 2032. The idea is that fastest growing jobs often stem from industries with high demand, innovation, and adaptability. These sectors tend to evolve rapidly, creating ongoing opportunities for skilled workers. By aligning with such growth, individuals can secure employment in dynamic fields less susceptible to automation or outsourcing. Moreover, as industries expand and evolve, job openings increase to meet growing demands and emerging needs. This influx of job opportunities contributes to the security of fastest-growing professions by providing a broader range of employment options. For job growth rates, we relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USA.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Wirth wrote so clearly, Kay says, that not only could he understand what he was reading, but he felt he could even argue with it. A decade later, Kay was at the famed Xerox PARC\u2014where he helped work on what became the Xerox Alto, a computer that inspired both Apple Mac and Microsoft Windows.\n\nContinue reading",

        "title": "Pension Plan Redux: 3 Companies That Could Take a Page From IBM\u2019s Playbook",
        "content": "Earlier in February, The New York Timesreported on changes IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made to its pension plans that will likely save it millions in payments to its employees.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019d read anything about the move. However, new stories about the subject started popping up as early as Nov. 7. Russell Investments publishedHow IBM reopened its DB plan to replace 401(k) contributions on its company website:\n\n\u201cStarting in 2024, IBM will replace its 401(k) plan matching contributions with a new benefit earned within its overfunded DB plan, which has been frozen since 2008. This move essentially un-freezes the tech giant\u2019s DB plan,\u201d Russell Investments\u2019 Justin Owens wrote in November.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile Owens suggests that the new benefit will likely be of similar value, others believe IBM did this to avoid millions in payments to its employees.\n\nHere\u2019s what NYT Strategies columnist Jeff Sommer had to say about the move:\n\n\u201cCrucially, IBM\u2019s maneuver is likely to be wonderful for its shareholders. The company is saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year by stopping contributions to employee 401(k) accounts,\u201d Sommer wrote on Feb. 9.\n\nWithout getting too far into the weeds, Sommer points out that companies with fully funded pensions, or those with closed or frozen ones, will likely consider pulling the same move.\n\nThese three Dow Jones Industrial Average companies could take a page from IBM\u2019s playbook.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nPg. 72 0f Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) 2023 annual report shows that the company\u2019s defined benefit (DB) retirement plans had $33.61 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2023, up from $31.50 billion a year earlier, for a funded surplus of $1.86 billion, down from $2.11 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nIn 2023, the company contributed $268 million to the plans, while plan participants contributed $73 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for J&J\u2019s defined contribution (DC) plans, it has the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan for eligible salaried and certain salaried employees. Employees receive a matching contribution from the company for 75% of an employee\u2019s contributions, up to 6%.\n\nSo, for example, if the employee contributes $10,000 in 2024, and their annual salary is $100,000, the company would contribute 75% of $6,000 (6% of $100,000), or $4,500, working out to a 45% match of the entire $10,000 contribution.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, the company paid out $268.2 million in contributions to the savings plan. If it were to cease making contributions to the DC plan, shifting the payment to the employee from the DB plan surplus, it would have seven years with no or low annual payments.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nPg. 222 0f JPMorgan Chase\u2019s (NYSE:JPM) 2023 annual report shows that the company\u2019s defined benefit (DB) retirement plans had $22.01 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2023, up from $19.89 billion a year earlier, for a funded surplus of $7.27 billion, up from $6.35 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nThe bank\u2019s principal DB plan in the U.S. covers most of its U.S. employees.\n\n\u201cThe principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants\u2019 accounts based on their accumulated balances,\u201d states pg. 222 of its 2023 annual report.\n\nAs for the bank\u2019s DC plans, it has the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan for eligible salaried and certain salaried employees. Employees receive a matching contribution from the company for 100% up to 5% of their eligible compensation.\n\nUsing the previous example, if the employee contributes $10,000 in 2024, and their annual salary is $100,000, the company would contribute 100% of $5,000 (5% of $100,000), or $4,500, working out to a 50% match of the entire $10,000 contribution.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2023, the company paid out $973.94 million in contributions to the savings plan in 2023. If it were to cease making contributions to the DC plan, shifting the payment to the employee from the DB plan surplus, it would have more than seven years with no or low annual payments.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nPg. 111 0f Walt Disney\u2019s (NYSE:DIS) 2023 annual report shows that the company\u2019s defined benefit (DB) retirement plans had $15.44 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, 2023, up from $14.72 billion a year earlier, for a funded surplus of $752 million, up from a deficit of $307 million at the end of 2022. Taking postretirement medical plans into consideration lowers the surplus to $572 million.\n\nThe entertainment company\u2019s DB plan covers employees hired before Jan. 1, 2012. Employees hired after 2011 were given a DC plan to work with.\n\nAs for Disney\u2019s DC plans, it has the Disney Savings and Investment Plan for eligible salaried and certain salaried employees. Employees receive a matching contribution from the company for the lesser of 2% of compensation or 50% of employee contributions.\n\nUsing the previous example, if the employee contributes $10,000 in 2024, and their annual salary is $100,000, the company would contribute $2,000 [2% of $100,000, less than 50% of $10,000, or $5,000]. That works out to a 20% match of the $10,000 contribution. That\u2019s not very good by Dow 30 standards.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, the company paid out $91.98 million in contributions to the savings plan in 2022. If it were to cease making contributions to the DC plan, shifting the payment to the employee from the DB plan surplus, it would have more than eight years with no or low annual payments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) closed the latest trading day at $185.72, indicating a +0.82% change from the previous session's end. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.04%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.16%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.28%.\n\nShares of the technology and consulting company have depreciated by 3.27% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.78% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.01%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of IBM in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.59, marking a 16.91% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.56 billion, showing a 2.18% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $10.06 per share and revenue of $63.79 billion, indicating changes of +4.57% and +3.12%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.16% higher within the past month. As of now, IBM holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nDigging into valuation, IBM currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.3. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 17.78 for its industry.\n\nAlso, we should mention that IBM has a PEG ratio of 3.61. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.85.\n\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 175, placing it within the bottom 31% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Is IBM (IBM) Down 3.3% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for IBM (IBM). Shares have lost about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IBM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nIBM Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates on Solid AI, Cloud Demand\r\n\r\nIBM ended 2023 on a positive note with strong fourth-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company witnessed healthy demand for hybrid cloud and AI solutions with a client-focused portfolio and broad-based growth.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $3,285 million or $3.54 per share compared with $2,711 million or $3.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line growth.\r\n\r\nExcluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $3.87 per share compared with $3.60 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents.\r\n\r\nFor 2023, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $7,514 million or $8.15 per share compared with $1,783 million or $1.95 per share in 2022. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $9.62 per share compared with $9.13 in 2022.\n\nQuarter Details\n\nQuarterly total revenues increased to $17,381 million from $16,690 million on strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 3% year over year. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $17,279 million.\r\n\r\nGross profit was $10,267 million compared with $9,632 million in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 59.1% and 57.7% owing to a strong portfolio mix. Total expenses increased to $6,509 million from $6,320 million, driven by higher interest expense and R&D costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nSoftware: Revenues improved to $7,514 million from $7,288 million, driven by growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, Red Hat, Automation, Data & AI and Transaction Processing. The reported segment revenues exceeded our estimate of $6,936 million owing to solid hybrid cloud traction. Segment pre-tax income from continuing operations was $2,417 million compared with $2,347 million in the year-ago quarter for margins of 32.2% each. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation and Data & AI.\r\n\r\nConsulting: Revenues were $5,048 million, up from $4,770 million, led by pervasive growth driven by demand for digital transformation, increasing revenues across all business lines and regions. The segment\u2019s revenues beat our estimate of $5,017 million. Segment pre-tax income was $582 million compared with $523 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by productivity enhancement initiatives for respective margins of 11.5% and 11%.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure: Revenues were $4,604 million, up from $4,483 million, as lower demand for support services was more than offset by higher demand for hybrid and distributed infrastructure. Segment pre-tax income was $1,185 million compared with $1,026 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 25.7% and 22.9%.\r\n\r\nFinancing: Revenues improved to $175 million from $172 million. Segment pre-tax income was $117 million compared with $75 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 67.3% and 43.6%.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, IBM generated $4,463 million in cash from operations compared with $3,965 million in the year-ago quarter, bringing the respective tallies for 2023 and 2022 to $13,931 million and $10,435 million. Free cash flow was $6,087 million in the quarter, up from $5,209 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher profit and working capital efficiencies. As of Dec 31, 2023, the company had $13,068 million in cash and cash equivalents with $50,121 million of long-term debt compared with respective tallies of $7,886 million and $46,189 million in the year-ago period.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor full-year 2024, the company expects revenue growth in the mid-single digit on a constant currency basis. Free cash flow is expected to be in the vicinity of $12 billion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, IBM has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise IBM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned -3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +16.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.6%. This estimate has changed +2.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.58 indicates a change of +5.1% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.2%. The $63.79 billion and $66.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.1% and +4.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $17.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $3.87 for the same period compares with $3.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.59%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tradeweb Markets and Newmont have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Tradeweb Markets TW as the Bull of the Day and Newmont Corporation NEM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Nvidia Corporation NVDA and International Business Machines Corporation IBM.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nTradeweb Markets, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a global operator of electronic trading marketplaces. The stock recently eclipsed its former all-time high and has been benefitting from a resurgence in the financial sector. Shares have widely outperformed the market over the past year, and the trend looks set to continue in 2024. TW stock is displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.\n\nThe company is part of the Zacks Financial \u2013 Investment Bank industry group, which currently ranks in the top 12% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nHistorical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock\u2019s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It\u2019s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.\n\nCompany Description\n\nTradeweb Markets builds and operates global electronic marketplaces. These marketplaces facilitate trading in a range of asset classes including equities, rates, credit, and money markets. Tradeweb offers pre-trade and post-trade data and analytics, trade execution and processing, as well as reporting services.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also provides a range of electronic, voice, and hybrid platforms to dealers and financial institutions via the Dealerweb platform. In addition, Tradeweb offers trading solutions for financial advisory firms and traders with its Tradeweb Direct platform.\n\nServing institutional, wholesale, and retail clients, Tradeweb boasts a wide array of customers including asset managers, hedge funds, central banks, proprietary trading firms, insurance companies, and brokerage firms.\n\nEarnings Trends and Future Estimates\n\nTradeweb Markets has established an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Earlier this month, the New York-based company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.64/share, a 1.59% surprise over the $0.63/share consensus estimate. Earnings improved 30.6% year-over-year, while revenues jumped 26.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe electronic marketplace facilitator has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 1.4%. Consistently beating earnings estimates is a recipe for success.\n\nAnalysts covering TW are in agreement and have been raising their earnings estimates across the board. For the current quarter, analysts have bumped up earnings estimates by 6.35% in the past 60 days. The Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.67/share, reflecting potential growth of 24.1% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to climb 19.9% to $394.8 million.\n\nLet\u2019s Get Technical\n\nTW shares have advanced more than 42% over the last year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio \u2013 one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nNotice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of 52-week highs and recently surpassed its former all-time high. With both strong fundamental and technical indicators, TW is poised to continue its outperformance.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Tradeweb Markets has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and TW continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock. The company has shown an ability to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape, which puts it in a strong position moving forward.\n\nBacked by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it\u2019s not difficult to see why TW stock is a compelling investment. An appealing technical trend along with robust fundamentals paint a bullish picture for Tradeweb Markets.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nNewmont Corporation is engaged in the exploration and production of gold, copper, silver, zinc and lead. The company operates primarily in North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. Newmont is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of gold with several active mines in Peru, Australia, Ghana, and Nevada.\n\nFounded in 1916 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, Newmont has over 30,000 employees and contractors worldwide and is a member of the S&P 500.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nNewmont, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Mining \u2013 Miscellaneous industry group. This industry ranks in the bottom 34% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has so far this year.\n\nStocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be potential candidates for short positions. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they are part of a lackluster industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.\n\nDespite a rebound in stocks with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting new all-time highs, NEM shares have not been participating lately. The stock has experienced considerable volatility over the past year.\n\nPast Earnings Misses and Deteriorating Outlook\n\nHeading into today\u2019s quarterly release, NEM had fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the prior four quarters. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -3.71%. Note that stocks can experience heightened volatility (in both directions) surrounding earnings announcements.\n\nThe company is grappling with higher production costs and a considerable rise in overall capital expenditures. Furthermore, a downward revision in gold production guidance last year along with various operational challenges have added to near-term uncertainty.\n\nNewmont has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. As we zoom out and look at fiscal 2024 as a whole, analysts have decreased EPS estimates by 11.69% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $2.19/share.\n\nFalling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. A history of missing earnings estimates is the opposite of what the bulls want to see.\n\nTechnical Outlook\n\nAs illustrated below, NEM stock is in a sustained downtrend and has witnessed considerable volatility, all while the general market reaches new heights. Notice how both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages are sloping down signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock has made a series of lower lows over the past year.\n\nNEM stock has also experienced what is known as a \u2018death cross\u2019, wherein the stock\u2019s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Newmont would have to make a surprising move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. Shares have fallen more than 23% in the past year alone.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that NEM stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\u2019s downtrend.\n\nHighlighted underperformance bodes well for the bears. Potential investors may want to consider including this stock as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of NEM shares until the situation shows major signs of improvement.\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Solid AI Stocks Worth a Look for the Rest of the Year\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has led to numerous technological progressions, making 2023 a breakout year for tech companies providing AI-related products and services. Yet, skeptics are concerned about the growth of AI in 2024 as it\u2019s an expensive undertaking and requires chips that are presently in short supply.\n\nHowever, market experts believe that the AI market will grow this year and beyond as it will successfully bridge the gap between humans and machines. AI is likely to lead to technological breakthroughs in handling various data, texts, videos and images.\n\nAI is expected to increase cerebral aptitudes with tools including virtual aids, personalized references and language understanding. Many prominent financial firms also expect AI integration to boost labor productivity and economic growth in the coming years.\n\nWith AI poised to modernize business processes, and create a congenial business environment, its market is projected to reach $305.9 billion by the end of this year, and the United States will have the largest market size, per Statista.\n\nIn reality, the AI market is estimated to witness a compound annual growth rate of 15.83% from 2024 to 2030, and eventually touch a market volume of $730.8 by 2030, added Statista.\n\nThanks to the AI boom, not only the tech bigwigs but also a slew of tech companies gained traction in recent times. Bespoke Investment Group added that all 67 stocks related to AI listed on the S&P 500 Index have soared 45.3% on average since November 2022, whereas the remaining 433 non-AI stocks advanced only 9.2% in the same period.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the AI-related group of stocks on the S&P 500 has gained an average of 3.7% year to date, more than non-AI stocks\u2019 average gain of 1.1%.\n\nThus, banking on solid growth prospects in the field of AI, astute investors should keep an eye on AI-related industry-leading companies to reap handsome returns. Such players are Alphabet Inc., Nvidia Corporation and International Business Machines Corporation.\n\nAlphabet has transformed from only a search engine player to a cloud-computing provider. But it\u2019s the Google search engine that has utilized AI to guide users to improve spelling while making search-related queries. At the same time, Alphabet\u2019s products, including Gmail and Google Cloud, incorporate AI functionalities to offer various services to clients.\n\nAnyhow, Alphabet\u2019s cloud division is playing a pivotal role in improving the company\u2019s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. GOOGL\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 16.6% and 14.9%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 11.7% and 11.1%, respectively. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNvidia was involved in providing graphic processors to PC manufacturers, a less lucrative market, for quite some time. However, the graphics processing unit market boomed on increased demand for AI services. Notably, the curiosity in AI came in after the launch of Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia does have competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., but its commitment to achieve cutting-edge technology, is keeping it way ahead of its competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 269.5% and 64.5%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 118.8% and 55.1%, respectively. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nInternational Business Machines is known for having created one of the most powerful AI systems, such as Watson, which is used for data analysis and various kinds of decision-making. IBM did confirm that the demand for their software and services improved recently as more customers are using AI systems.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up nearly 3% over the past 60 days. IBM\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 4.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 3.1% and 4.4%, respectively. IBM currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), with its dividend yield of 4%, presents a compelling investment opportunity in the real estate sector, focusing on data center properties. This specialization is particularly relevant in today\u2019s digital age, tapping into the critical need for cybersecurity and data protection, heightened by the global surge in online activities and digital transactions.

This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "In this article, we will be navigating through the 15 most pro-American countries in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Pro-American Countries in the World.\n\nGlobal Stance on the United States\n\nAs reported by the Pew Research Center, about 54% of individuals in 23 countries have shown their confidence in US President Joe Biden in 2023. Middle-income nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia have especially rated Biden better than Trump. Even in some nations where Trump used to be well known, Biden has secured better ratings. The overall reputation of the country has also been positive since more than half of the respondents in numerous countries held favorable views. Another good stance on the US is relevant to its technological products, military, universities, and entertainment sector. Especially in the tech field, the country has been deemed as best or above average by the majority. This is a major achievement for the US among other wealthy nations around the world.\n\nEconomically, the US has emerged as a leading power. Although the country had received competition from China, many nations have regarded the US instead of China as the current dominant economic power. Some of these nations include Canada, Indonesia, Japan, France, Hungary, Sweden, Poland, and the Netherlands. The most competitive economies in the world have been previously covered.\n\nHowever, the role of the United States in the global arena remains controversial. While a median of 82% believed that the US tends to interfere in international affairs, 61% think of the US as a contributing power to global peace and stability. In the case of the NATO allies of the country including Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom, the percentage of people who are of the opinion that the US takes into account the interests of other countries has improved over the last 20 years. Simultaneously, many deem the US as a politically stable nation.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Reputable Companies in America\n\nAmerican tech products have been successful in securing a positive reputation for the US globally. There are numerous American technology companies that have earned the US this reputation by consistently advancing technologically while contributing to the national economy. Some of these include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Let\u2019s take a look at what these firms have been up to. You can also take a look at some of the fastest-growing technology companies in the US.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been continuously investing in artificial intelligence. On February 16, the company reported that it has pledged to counter the deceptive use of AI for the global elections in 2024. Some of the other partnering companies dedicated to solving the issue include Adobe, Amazon, ElevenLabs, Google, and IBM. Along with the partnering companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be developing tools to combat deceptive AI content regarding elections while raising awareness among the public on the issue. Deceptive AI content includes all the images, audio, and videos that are AI-generated and mislead the public by faking the voices and even actions of political candidates and election officials.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) continues to support its partners and clients by expanding its global footprint. On February 8, the company reported that it has now enabled those in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Denmark to purchase the IBM software on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leading multinational technology company. The company serves as one of the largest semiconductor chip manufacturers globally. On February 20, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) introduced a high-performance computing cluster \u2018Cardinal\u2019 in collaboration with Dell Technologies, Nvidia, and the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC). This cluster is aimed at supporting AI innovation in Ohio. Cardinal is expected to efficiently manage AI workloads. It will be using Dell PowerEdge servers and the Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae CPU Max Series. Cardinal will also be assisting engineers, researchers, and scientists and will cater to the increasing demand for high-performance computing resources in Ohio.\n\nWithout further ado, let's move to the 15 most pro-American countries in the world. 15 Most Pro-American Countries in the World\n\nPHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 15 most pro-American countries in the world, we sourced data from the Pew Research Center.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is ratcheting up the security of its iMessage app to protect users against future attacks by high-powered, nation-state hackers. The company says it is updating the security protocol behind iMessage to combat attacks using quantum computers.\n\nAccording to Apple, while it\u2019s difficult to break the company\u2019s current encryptions using conventional supercomputers, quantum computers could make cracking those encryptions child\u2019s play. To that end, the company is introducing what it calls its PQ3 cryptographic protocol, a new form of encrypting users' messages that will exist alongside Apple\u2019s existing encryption tools.\n\nThe reason for the move, Apple says, is to prevent what are referred to as \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks. The idea is relatively simple: Sophisticated attackers suck up encrypted data, whether that\u2019s a person\u2019s texts or government secrets, with the hope of decrypting that information in the future when quantum computers become powerful and reliable enough to do so.\n\nQuantum computers are fundamentally different from the supercomputers in use today. Conventional supercomputers perform calculations using binary code, which is made up of strings of 1s and 0s that systems translate into everything from YouTube videos to the webpage you\u2019re reading this on. The IBM Quantum System One quantum computing system is seen during a groundbreaking ceremony at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on Friday, Oct. 13, 2023, in Troy, N.Y. (Hans Pennink/AP Images for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nQuantum computers, on the other hand, process data using what are known as qubits, which can be made up of electrons and protons and can exist as 1s and 0s at the same time. They\u2019re also capable of processing the kind of calculations that would overwhelm a traditional supercomputer.\n\nYou might have seen a quantum computer in an article or two displaying its intricate collection of cooling pipes that help keep the system hovering just above absolute zero, which allows for the use of superconductors.\n\nBut quantum computers aren\u2019t exactly available at your local Best Buy. The systems are generally used by major tech firms \u2014 IBM (IBM) has famously been working with the technology for years \u2014 and government agencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s more, quantum computers aren\u2019t as reliable as conventional supercomputers. But security experts fear when they reach a certain level of power and reliability, they\u2019ll easily cut through traditional encryption methods. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe day when quantum computers can break those encryptions, which protect everything from our messages to national security secrets, is referred to as \u201cQ-day,\u201d and while there\u2019s no firm agreement on when it will occur, many believe it will happen in the coming decades.\n\nApple is banking on Q-day coming sooner than later and is working to ensure iMessages are protected. Importantly, Apple says there are no motivating factors behind the move to roll out quantum computing protections. Rather, it\u2019s a proactive move designed to upgrade the app\u2019s overall security posture.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to numerous technological progressions, making 2023 a breakout year for tech companies providing AI-related products and services. Yet, skeptics are concerned about the growth of AI in 2024 as it\u2019s an expensive undertaking and requires chips that are presently in short supply.\n\nHowever, market experts believe that the AI market will grow this year and beyond as it will successfully bridge the gap between humans and machines. AI is likely to lead to technological breakthroughs in handling various data, texts, videos and images.\n\nAI is expected to increase cerebral aptitudes with tools including virtual aids, personalized references and language understanding. Many prominent financial firms also expect AI integration to boost labor productivity and economic growth in the coming years.\n\nWith AI poised to modernize business processes, and create a congenial business environment, its market is projected to reach $305.9 billion by the end of this year, and the United States will have the largest market size, per Statista.\n\nIn reality, the AI market is estimated to witness a compound annual growth rate of 15.83% from 2024 to 2030, and eventually touch a market volume of $730.8 by 2030, added Statista.\n\nThanks to the AI boom, not only the tech bigwigs but also a slew of tech companies gained traction in recent times. Bespoke Investment Group added that all 67 stocks related to AI listed on the S&P 500 Index have soared 45.3% on average since November 2022, whereas the remaining 433 non-AI stocks advanced only 9.2% in the same period.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the AI-related group of stocks on the S&P 500 has gained an average of 3.7% year to date, more than non-AI stocks\u2019 average gain of 1.1%.\n\nThus, banking on solid growth prospects in the field of AI, astute investors should keep an eye on AI-related industry-leading companies to reap handsome returns. Such players are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Nvidia Corporation NVDA and International Business Machines Corporation IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has transformed from only a search engine player to a cloud-computing provider. But it\u2019s the Google search engine that has utilized AI to guide users to improve spelling while making search-related queries. At the same time, Alphabet\u2019s products, including Gmail and Google Cloud, incorporate AI functionalities to offer various services to clients.\n\nAnyhow, Alphabet\u2019s cloud division is playing a pivotal role in improving the company\u2019s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. GOOGL\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 16.6% and 14.9%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 11.7% and 11.1%, respectively. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNvidia was involved in providing graphic processors to PC manufacturers, a less lucrative market, for quite some time. However, the graphics processing unit market boomed on increased demand for AI services. Notably, the curiosity in AI came in after the launch of Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia does have competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, but its commitment to achieve cutting-edge technology, is keeping it way ahead of its competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 269.5% and 64.5%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 118.8% and 55.1%, respectively. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nInternational Business Machines is known for having created one of the most powerful AI systems, such as Watson, which is used for data analysis and various kinds of decision-making. IBM did confirm that the demand for their software and services improved recently as more customers are using AI systems.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up nearly 3% over the past 60 days. IBM\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 4.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 3.1% and 4.4%, respectively.

        "title": "IBM Report: Identity Comes Under Attack, Straining Enterprises' Recovery Time from Breaches",
        "content": "-71% spike in cyberattacks caused by exploiting identity - 50% AI market share milestone to trigger a cyber problem - Nearly 70% of attacks globally targeted critical infrastructure in 2023 - Europe feels brunt of cyberattacks, making up 32% of global incidents\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 21, 2024 /CNW/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released the 2024 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index highlighting an emerging global identity crisis as cybercriminals double down on exploiting user identities to compromise enterprises worldwide. According to IBM X-Force, IBM Consulting's offensive and defensive security services arm, in 2023, cybercriminals saw more opportunities to \"log in\" versus hack into corporate networks through valid accounts \u2013 making this tactic a preferred weapon of choice for threat actors. IBM x-force Threat Intelligence Index 2024\n\nThe X-Force Threat Intelligence Index\u00a0is based on insights and observations from monitoring over 150 billion security events per day in more than 130 countries. In addition, data is gathered and analyzed from multiple sources within IBM, including IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, X-Force Red, IBM Managed Security Services, and data provided from Red Hat Insights and Intezer , which contributed to the 2024 report.\n\nSome of the key highlights include:\n\nAttacks on critical infrastructure reveal industry \"faux pas.\" In nearly 85% of attacks on critical sectors, compromise could have been mitigated with patching, multi-factor authentication, or least-privilege principals \u2013 indicating that what the security industry historically described as \"basic security\" may be harder to achieve than portrayed. Ransomware groups pivot to leaner business model. Ransomware attacks on enterprises saw a nearly\u00a012% drop last year, as larger organizations opt against paying and decrypting, in favor of rebuilding their infrastructure. With this growing pushback likely to impact adversaries' revenue expectations from encryption-based extortion, groups that previously specialized in ransomware were observed pivoting to infostealers. ROI from attacks on generative AI not there \u2013 yet. X-Force analysis projects that when a single generative AI technology approaches 50% market share or when the market consolidates to three or less technologies, it could trigger at-scale attacks against these platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"While 'security fundamentals' doesn't get as many head turns as 'AI-engineered attacks,' it remains that enterprises' biggest security problem boils down to the basic and known \u2013 not the novel and unknown\" said Charles Henderson, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting, and Head of IBM X-Force. \"Identity is being used against enterprises time and time again, a problem that will worsen as adversaries invest in AI to optimize the tactic.\"\n\nA Global Identity Crisis Poised to Worsen\n\nExploiting valid accounts has become the path of least resistance for cybercriminals, with billions of compromised credentials accessible on the Dark Web today. In 2023, X-Force saw attackers increasingly invest in operations to obtain users' identities\u00a0\u2013 with a 266% uptick in infostealing malware, designed to steal personal identifiable information like emails, social media and messaging app credentials, banking details, crypto wallet data and more.\n\nThis \"easy entry\" for attackers is one that's harder to detect, eliciting a costly response from enterprises. According to X-Force, major incidents caused by attackers using valid accounts were associated to nearly 200% more complex response measures by security teams than the average incident \u2013\u00a0with defenders needing to distinguish between legitimate and malicious user activity on the network. In fact, IBM's 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report found that breaches caused by stolen or compromised credentials required roughly 11 months to detect and recover from \u2013 the longest response lifecycle than any other infection vector.\n\nThis wide reach into users' online activity was evident in the FBI and European law enforcement's April 2023 takedown of a global cybercrime forum that collected the login details of more than 80 million user accounts. Identity-based threats will likely continue to grow as adversaries leverage generative AI to optimize their attacks. Already in 2023, X-Force observed over 800,000 posts on AI and GPT across Dark Web forums, reaffirming these innovations have caught cybercriminals attention and interest.\n\nAdversaries \"Log into\" Critical Infrastructure Networks\n\nWorldwide, nearly 70% of attacks that X-Force responded to were against critical infrastructure organizations, an alarming finding highlighting that cybercriminals are wagering on these high value targets' need for uptime to advance their objectives.\n\nNearly 85% of attacks that X-Force responded to on this sector were caused by exploiting public-facing applications, phishing emails, and the use of valid accounts.\u00a0 The latter poses an increased risk to the sector, with DHS CISA stating that the majority of successful attacks on government agencies, critical infrastructure organizations and state-level government bodies in 2022 involved\u00a0the use of valid accounts. This highlights the need for these organizations to frequently stress test their environments for potential exposures and develop incident response plans.\n\nGenerative AI \u2013 The Next Big Frontier to Secure\n\nFor cybercriminals to see ROI from their campaigns, the technologies they target must be ubiquitous across most organizations worldwide.\u00a0Just as past technological enablers fostered cybercriminal activities \u2013 as observed with ransomware and Windows Server's market dominance, BEC scams and Microsoft 365 dominance or cryptojacking and the Infrastructure-as-a-Service market consolidation \u2013 this pattern will most likely extend across AI.\n\nX-Force assesses that once generative AI market dominance is established \u2013 where a single technology approaches 50% market share or when the market consolidates to three or less technologies \u2013 it could trigger the maturity of AI as an attack surface, mobilizing further investment in new tools from cybercriminals. Although generative AI is currently in its pre-mass market stage, it's paramount that enterprises secure their AI models before\u00a0cybercriminals scale their activity. Enterprises should also recognize that their existing underlying infrastructure is a gateway to their AI models that doesn't require novel tactics from attackers to target \u2013 highlighting the need for a holistic approach to security in the age of generative AI, as outlined in the IBM Framework for Securing Generative AI.\n\nAdditional findings:\n\nEurope \u2013 adversaries' preferred target --\u00a0Nearly one in three attacks observed worldwide targeted Europe, with the region also experiencing the most ransomware attacks globally (26%). Where did all the\u00a0phish go? Despite remaining a top infection vector, phishing attacks saw a 44% decrease in volume from 2022. But with AI poised to optimize this attack and X-Force research indicating that AI can speed up attacks by nearly two days, the infection vector will remain a preferred choice for cybercriminals. Everyone is vulnerable \u2013\u00a0Red Hat Insights found that 92% of customers have at least one CVE with known exploits unaddressed in their environment at the time of scanning, while 80% of the top ten vulnerabilities detected across systems in 2023 were given a 'High' or 'Critical' CVSS base severity score. \"Kerberoasting\" pays off \u2013 X-Force observed a 100% increase in \"kerberoasting\" attacks, wherein attackers attempt to impersonate users to escalate privileges by abusing Microsoft Active Directory tickets. Security\u00a0misconfigurations \u2013 X-Force Red penetration testing engagements indicate that security misconfigurations accounted for 30% of total exposures identified, observing more than 140 ways that attackers can exploit misconfigurations.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nDownload a copy of the 2024 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Deep in the snowy northern island of Hokkaido, Japan is pouring billions of dollars into a long-shot bet to revive its chip-making prowess and insulate its economy from growing US-China tensions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCapital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Stocks Fall Before Nvidia\u2019s Make-or-Break Moment: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\nExcavators and trucks criss-cross the frosty ground as construction work continues on a futuristic factory looking over a grassy plain with roaming horses. It\u2019s a development that is changing the landscape of an area known for farming, military bases and Chitose airport. It\u2019s a project that also aims to change the face of Japan\u2019s chip industry.\n\nA freshly created homegrown venture, Rapidus Corp., is looking to mass produce state-of-the art 2 nanometer logic chips in 2027 from an initial starting point of zero. By industry standards it\u2019s an implausible challenge for an 18-month-old venture in a country that has fallen far behind overseas rivals on semiconductor production.But with the US and China sparring over access to the latest chipmaking expertise and equipment, Japan\u2019s government has sensed an opportunity to leverage Washington\u2019s concern over supply chain security to get back into a game it once dominated.\n\nThe stakes are huge. Advanced chips will serve as the foundation for a dozen critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, weapons systems and electric vehicles. A large portion of global production centers on Taiwan and South Korea, leaving future supplies vulnerable to regional tensions.\n\n\u201cThere are geopolitical, economic security factors involved,\u201d said Atsuo Shimizu, a Rapidus executive in charge of launching the new foundry. \u201cTo survive as a nation, Japan needs to be a global player with technology. And we can clearly demonstrate that with semiconductors.\u201d Tokyo has already shown it means business. In less than three years, Japan has earmarked about \uffe54 trillion ($26.7 billion) for revitalizing its semiconductor punching power with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida targeting financial support for the industry to eventually reach \uffe510 trillion with private sector support. Among the goals is a tripling of domestically produced chip sales to more than \uffe515 trillion by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan\u2019s new chip strategy has two main strands. First, the country is seeking to reestablish itself as a prime location for manufacturing legacy chips by luring to Japan the biggest foreign names in the industry with generous subsidies of up to half of the set-up costs.The second and more ambitious part of the strategy is the Rapidus project in Hokkaido aimed at restoring Japan\u2019s place as a player at the forefront of silicon-chip wizardry.\u201cWhy do we do so much for chips? Honestly, that\u2019s because there\u2019s the US-China confrontation,\u201d said Kazumi Nishikawa, principal director of economic security policy at Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and one of the architects of the strategy. \u201cIf chip supplies from Taiwan halt, there will be negative impacts of trillions of dollars everywhere and economies will collapse.\u201d\n\nAlready Tokyo can claim some success in the first and larger part of its strategy. The world\u2019s biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has a $7 billion factory edging closer to production in Kumamoto, southern Japan, with another one to come and talk of a third. The Taiwanese giant has quickly realized that chip projects partly bankrolled by Tokyo can get off the ground a whole lot faster than in the US or other countries.\n\nBy drawing on the expertise of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers, Japan hopes to recreate chip-related ecosystems that provide employment and renewed growth in its regional economies. At the same time these moves will help strengthen Japan\u2019s credentials as a key ally in a US-led global supply chain committed to keeping the production line of vital semiconductors rolling for everything from smartphones and cars to the latest missile systems.The fate of the second part of Tokyo\u2019s strategy looks far less certain. The Rapidus project has generated both excitement and doubts. Its success hinges on achieving a huge technological jump with little idea of how costly or reliable the final output will be\u2014or if there will be any buyers. It\u2019s a target that even industry leaders are struggling to attain.\n\nRead More: Japan-Backed Startup Woos Suppliers to Make Chip Hub in Hokkaido\n\nOn the plus side, Japan can lean on the US as its ally this time around, rather than its technological foe\u2014as was the case back in 1986 when Washington put pressure on Tokyo to limit its chip exports.As part of the Rapidus project, IBM Corp. is training about 100 veteran Japanese engineers in Albany, New York, to get them up to speed on frontier level US chip expertise.\u201cWe're partners, allies, collaborators in making sure that our national security, our economic securities are aligned, because the threat is coming from somewhere else. And that somewhere else is China,\u201d US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said. \u201cWe're in the boat together and we're paddling in the same direction.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s strategy marks a departure from previous attempts to support its chip industry that largely assumed it didn\u2019t need outside help -- and ended in failure.\n\nAlong with TSMC, Micron Technology Inc., ASML Holding NV and Samsung are also investing in production or research facilities in Japan as companies look for the best deals for shoring up their future output in an uncertain world.The speed of Japan\u2019s assistance contrasts with the policy gridlock of the US. The 2022 Chips and Science Act set aside $39 billion in direct subsidies to ramp up manufacturing in the US, but the first major award of $1.5 billion only got announced this week. Labor and cost challenges have also delayed the start of production at TSMC\u2019s new facility in Arizona. Over in Germany, budget turmoil has raised concerns about subsidies for TSMC and Intel Corp.\u201cJapan this time has taken a bold approach and has implemented very quick decision-making,\u201d Belgium-based microelectronics research hub Imec Chief Executive Officer Luc Van den hove said. \u201cIf I look back 20 years ago or 15 years ago, I think there was much more a closed policy especially from the government.\u201d\n\nThe TSMC plants have ample reason to be successful. The technology for the first plant\u2019s products, 12nm to 28nm logic chips, is already established. Kumamoto is on Japan\u2019s southern island of Kyushu where there\u2019s an ecosystem of about 1,000 related tech companies. And there are customers \u2013 including Japanese carmakers.\n\nTSMC\u2019s second foundry, officially announced earlier this month, will make 6nm to 7nm chips nearby. By 2037, tax revenues from the foundries are likely to have paid back the initial government outlays, according to lawmaker Yoshihiro Seki, secretary general of a coalition within Japan\u2019s ruling party dedicated to chips.\n\nJapan is an attractive location for other reasons, too. It has a highly disciplined workforce and reliable services. The plunge in the Japanese yen to its weakest levels in decades has also helped make the country far more affordable as a production base.Japan is also a key global supplier of some of the chemicals and equipment used in chipmaking. Some of those Japanese suppliers, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., have taken advantage of the flipside of the economic security concerns by tapping into a surge of Chinese demand as Beijing looks to ramp up its existing know-how before any more restrictions emerge.\n\nWhile some of the reasons for Japan\u2019s attractiveness as a chip-making base also hold true in northern Japan, the circumstances are quite different. Rapidus is starting out in a long-forgotten region for manufacturing with only about 20 local businesses related to chip making.Expertise at Japan\u2019s national technology institute has long been stalled at 45 nm, so for Rapidus to reach significant output of 2nm chips using unproven IBM technology in around five years looks a very tall order. Even if Rapidus is able to hit its target by 2027, TSMC and Samsung will likely have already jumped into the market at volumes that will give them a cost advantage.\n\nShigeru Fujii headed chipmaking at Japan\u2019s Fujitsu Ltd. when it lost out to cheaper Taiwanese and South Korean rivals in past decades. He\u2019s yet to see evidence that Rapidus can break into the cut-throat global market.\u201cThe problem is: Will there be any customers?\u201d Fujii said.\n\nThis time will be different, said Rapidus\u2019s Shimizu, who worked under Fujii at Fujitsu. As its name suggests, Rapidus will add value to its products by shortening delivery time for its bespoke chips \u2013 not just via the manufacturing process, but also by helping customers shorten the time-consuming design process, he said.The company won\u2019t be able to compete against TSMC and Samsung for commoditized devices so the company will aim for more of a premium niche market, Shimizu indicated.\n\nA shift in technology could also help Rapidus, Shimizu added. The 2-nanometer chips it envisages will use a Gate-All-Around transistor structure instead of the current FinFET structure, making it easier for newcomers to break in, Shimizu said.\u201cWe can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe government has so far promised \uffe5330 billion and earmarked an extra \uffe5646 billion in a fund to support the Rapidus project. That should cover half of an initial \uffe52 trillion investment, but the private company has yet to say how it will raise the remaining cash or an extra \uffe53 trillion needed to expand operations after the foundry is launched.In contrast to the government support Rapidus enjoys, the reaction from corporate Japan has been lukewarm. Big firms such as Toyota Motor Corp. have pledged only \uffe57.3 billion for the venture so far.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\u2026\u201cThe Japanese government's latest chip strategy looks better thought out than on previous occasions. The balance is a little skewed toward Rapidus and Kumamoto. Perhaps more could be done to support domestic chip design companies. The challenge for Rapidus is huge, and success probably shouldn't hinge on profits. If it can make any reliable 2 nanometer chips by 2027 that would be a success for Japan in terms of economic security.\u201d-- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI industry analyst\n\nEven if IBM trains engineers for the company, Rapidus will struggle to hire the 1,000 or so engineers and workers needed to launch the foundry, experts say. Japan\u2019s chip sector hemorrhaged around 30% of its jobs in the two decades through 2019 as its share of the global chipmaking market fell from over 50% to less than 10%. That leaves a shortage of at least 40,000 workers over the next decade as the population declines, according to METI.\n\nTakashi Yunogami is a former Hitachi Ltd. engineer who made news by fiercely criticizing past government initiatives in parliament right before the chip strategy was released. He likens Rapidus\u2019s 2nm goal to a little leaguer in baseball trying to turn into superstar Shohei Ohtani overnight.\n\n\u201cKids should dream, but if a baseball boy says he is trying to do well as a two-way player starting from tomorrow, I\u2019d say, \u2018Hold on. Let\u2019s take it step by step,\u2019\u201d Yunogami said.\n\nStill, in addition to the support from IBM, California-based Lam Research Corp. and Imec are planning to open shop in Hokkaido. Rapidus has also struck an agreement with Canada\u2019s Tenstorrent Inc. to jointly develop semiconductor intellectual property in AI devices.\u201cThere are so many risks and challenges for Rapidus. It\u2019s still in a research and development stage before becoming a business,\u201d said METI\u2019s Nishikawa.\n\nStill, Japan\u2019s hefty subsidies show a renewed determination at the trade and industry ministry to take advantage of a window of opportunity to claw back some of the nation\u2019s chip power. They also reflect the view that in an increasingly hostile world it\u2019s better to throw money at chip technology than to have no contingency plan at all.Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, North Korea\u2019s launching of missiles and China\u2019s posturing toward Taiwan have reminded the world of the vital importance of securing chip supplies and strengthening defense systems.\u201cChips are used for drones, fighters, submarines and missiles,\u201d said the LDP\u2019s Seki. \u201cIf we can make others feel Japan can halt chip exports if they mess with us, that will mean our investment has served as a war deterrent, too.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Takashi Mochizuki, Yuki Furukawa, Peter Elstrom and Vlad Savov.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable Today\u2019s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "15 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 biggest cloud providers by market share in 2024. We have also discussed the latest revenue and growth of top cloud providers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a rapid shift towards cloud adoption, with projections indicating that global spending on cloud services and related components will exceed $1.0 trillion in 2024, maintaining a CAGR of 15.7%.\n\nMoreover, the global cloud services market is witnessing major growth, with a projected value of $2.19 trillion by 2032, with a CAGR of 17.10% from 2023. In 2022, North America held a dominant market share of 42%, driven by a strong emphasis on digitalization, particularly in sectors like IoT, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Large enterprises accounted for 52% of the market share in 2022, reflecting their investment in cloud solutions for enhanced agility and efficiency.\n\nThe market is segmented by deployment, with private clouds leading in 2022 with a share of over 47%, offering organizations greater control and security. However, hybrid clouds are expected to witness rapid growth, driven by SMEs adopting cloud-based solutions for productivity enhancement and cost reduction. Software as a Service (SaaS) dominated the market in 2022 due to its ease of deployment and cost-effectiveness, while Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is projected to grow rapidly, fueled by the demand for hybrid cloud platforms and robust data storage solutions.\n\nIn terms of region, Asia Pacific is anticipated to experience exponential growth, fueled by increasing demand from sectors such as manufacturing and healthcare. Additionally, key market developments, such as collaborations between companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), underscore the growing importance of cloud technology in revolutionizing different industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, AI-as-a-Service is democratizing AI through cloud platforms, enabling businesses to harness transformative technologies without heavy investment. Leveraging vast compute power and data, AI models like ChatGPT are trained, offering economic and social benefits. Predicted to rise from 76% to 85%, multi-cloud strategies provide cost and flexibility advantages but pose challenges in data governance and integration.\n\nHybrid cloud solutions combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services are also gaining popularity, allowing organizations to balance security and flexibility. In 2024, real-time cloud infrastructure is becoming equally vital, as organizations are prioritizing up-to-the-minute insights over stale data. Streamed data consumption is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for instant access storage like Flash and solid-state devices. This shift accommodates trends such as cloud gaming and streamed entertainment from platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT), indicating a growing demand for real-time data handling capabilities.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (CGP) are the top three cloud providers in the world in 2024.\n\nOn the financial end, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s cloud division, AWS, witnessed a revenue growth of 13% year over year, hitting $24.20 billion, meeting analysts' expectations precisely. This growth was attributed to the increasing adoption of cloud services for artificial intelligence, with AWS introducing products like the Q chatbot and the Trainium2 chip. Despite this growth, AWS faced stiff competition from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Cloud, which saw revenue increases of 30% and 26%, respectively. However, AWS maintained its position as a major contributor to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s\u00a0 overall revenue, representing 14% of the company's total earnings.\n\nOperating income for AWS in the fourth quarter stood at $7.17 billion, surpassing StreetAccount's consensus by approximately 38%. This stable performance further solidified AWS's continued profitability and dominance in the cloud services market. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s decision to extend the useful life of its servers to six years is projected to bolster first-quarter operating income by $900 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with analysts estimating Azure to now be about three-quarters the size of its top competitor, compared to being only half its size five years ago. Much of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s recent success can be to its strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue growth in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure and cloud services division is being largely boosted by AI, with 6 points of revenue growth attributed to AI in the latest period. This growth outpaces AWS, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure\u2019s revenue increasing by 30% compared to AWS's 13% year-over-year growth.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investment in AI isn't just limited to software; they're also integrating AI capabilities into their cloud infrastructure, including the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for running AI models. Their collaboration with OpenAI, including technologies like GPT-4, has attracted a considerable number of Azure AI customers.\n\nTo read more about cloud companies, see Top 20 Cloud Computing Companies in USA. 15 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024\n\nA team of software developers gathered around a monitor discussing a new CRM platform.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the biggest cloud providers by market share in 2024, we utilized the market share value of big cloud companies based on their Q4 2023 revenue from their respective cloud segments. We obtained data of Q4 2023 market share data from CRN.com.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "Investing in AI stocks is thrilling, especially now in February 2024. Furthermore, the best AI stocks come from companies leading the way in new ideas. This is making tech that could really shake up our lives and jobs.\n\nThese industry-leading companies show they can cater to enterprises and professionals demanding AI tech. This sets them up nicely for more success in the future. They have an edge in one way or another, whether that be having thousands of AI patents or owning a technology that is needed to run AI.\n\nAs such, they offer a promising opportunity for investors looking for AI stocks to invest in now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a key player in AI thanks to its GPUs. For instance, the A100 and the ultra-modern H100 Tensor Core GPU have become foundational in training advanced artificial intelligence models.\n\nThe H100 uses high-level AI innovation in the form of Hopper architecture, which has the scalability and computing efficiency needed for huge AI workloads. This functionality has come with a huge demand for this tech from government organizations, cloud services, and more. That\u2019s good news for Nvidia stocks!\n\nThere\u2019s competition in any industry, and Nvidia has companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) angling for a market share. However, Nvidia\u2019s commitment to pushing out next-gen tech is keeping it in the lead.\n\nAugust 2023 saw the release of the Hopper GH200, with active deliveries set to start in Q2 2024. There\u2019s also the Black GB200 in the works, offering faster, more accurate training of sophisticated AI models.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position on the list of best AI stocks for February 2024 is not just because of its hardware offerings. The company also has CUDA, a computing software that\u2019s becoming the go-to for developers working on training enterprise-level AI models.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has surged by more than 40% since the beginning of the year, it remains one of the best AI stocks. Analysts expect EPS growth of 268% in FY2024 and 68% in FY2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, NVIDIA announced it would hold a conference call on February 21 to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024. In the last quarter, the semiconductor giant reported earnings of $3.92 per share, with revenue of $18.12 billion.\n\nWith exciting product cycles to come and increasing AI adoption in varied industries, NVIDIA and its stocks are well-positioned to capitalize on AI\u2019s growth.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe top AI stocks in February show great promise for companies doing the futuristic work of shifting enterprise AI usage from the experimentation stage to active implementation. One company helping its clients adopt AI technology is Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). In 2023, it announced a $3 billion investment in its AI division to assist customers in leveraging AI for enhanced business productivity.\n\nThis company is witnessing a huge demand for its services and is poised to capitalize on this opportunity. Accenture is a market leader in AI, with up to 1,450 AI patents and many more pending applications. Accenture is also leveraging its market-leading expertise to help clients in varied industries use AI to scale their operations.\n\nThe biggest selling point for Accenture is its specialized services, which revolve around personalization in generative AI. Through these services, Accenture is pushing the frontier, giving enterprises in manufacturing, retail, and other fields the power to modify foundational models as needed. It also offer a proprietary switchboard technology that combines various generative AI models to fit unique enterprise operational needs.\n\nAI may be a dream for many. However, for Accenture, that dream is now. The last fiscal year saw $300 million in sales from generative AI. This year, it already managed $450 million in bookings.\n\nIf numbers are to be believed\u2014and in the investment world, they are\u2014Accenture stocks are set for a massive bull run.\n\nAlongside the impressive sales numbers, the company is set to double the number of AI specialists it employs to 80,000. With only 12% of global companies able to harness AI capabilities, Accenture is likely to play a major role in disrupting the global business landscape through generative AI.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 is one of the biggest players providing cloud and quantum computing solutions. Also, its further advances are within AI, creating some of the most powerful AI systems like Watson, which are used across different industries, functions, and practices\u2014be it data analysis, human language understanding, or decision-making.\n\nIBM surprised experts by predicting a better-than-expected growth of around 5% in its sales for 2024, not counting changes in currency value. It also expects to have about $12 billion in free cash flow this year, which is impressive.\n\nIBM said more customers using AI systems boosted the demand for its software and services. Some top experts also pointed out that IBM\u2019s estimate of having $12 billion in cash for 2024 stands out, especially since they had thought it would be between $11 billion and $11.5 billion.\n\nIt has a price-earnings ratio of 18.3, which analysts think investors can take advantage of now. Hence, the company\u2019s excellent future and good value make IBM one of the best AI stocks to keep in view in February 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Exit Now! 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in February 2024",
        "content": "Blue-chips, or shares in established companies with long track records of slow-and-steady growth, may make for great selections in a diversified, long-term portfolio. However, while there are many great blue-chip stocks to buy, there are plenty of blue-chip stocks to sell as well.\n\nIn some cases, there are blue-chips where while the long-term forecast remains favorable, in the near-term selling to take profit may be the best course of action. These are blue-chips that have performed extremely well, yet are at risk of a short-term reversal because of valuation and/or temporary headwinds.\n\nIn other cases, there are blue-chips where the near-term and long-term forecasts warrant a fast exit. These are blue-chips that, in the past, may have performed well, but have started to (and are at risk of continuing to) underperform.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe blue-chip stocks listed below fall into either of these categories. Most of these blue-chips to avoid are also Dow Jones Industrial Average components, except for one, which is a former Dow Jones component.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou may question why I would include \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on this list. However, despite the iPhone maker\u2019s long-term strengths, near-term issues and valuation make it one of the blue-chips to sell.\n\nAAPL stock has pulled back since late last year, but further multiple compression may be justified. A slowdown in iPhone demand in China continues to drag down overall results.\n\nUnlike with other \u201cMag 7\u201d stocks, boosted higher by the generative AI trend, Apple\u2019s potential AI-related growth catalysts are arguably still at the \u201cwork-in-progress stage.\u201d\n\nWith famed investors like Warren Buffett and George Soros either trimming (or like Soros\u2019 investment firm, exiting completely) AAPL positions, consider following their lead, by taking profit. That said, with the possibility of AI catalysts beginning to play out down the road, you may want to keep an eye on AAPL, for re-entry at lower prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing (BA) Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logo\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast month, I laid out the bear case for Boeing (NYSE:BA), citing the recent flight safety controversy with the aerospace giant\u2019s 737 Max 9 passenger jets.\n\nThis headwind continues to affect the performance of shares, and is a key reason why BA is one of the blue-chip stocks to sell.\n\nStill, that\u2019s not all. While BA stock has only partially recovered since tanking at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, shares today trade at a valuation that fully prices-in a comeback that has yet to fully arrive. At current prices, Boeing trades for 58.9 times estimated 2024 earnings, and 25.2 times estimated 2025 earnings.\n\nThis comes even as Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun concedes that the company may have to \u201cgo slow to go fast,\u201d by prioritizing putting quality/safety concerns to rest. This suggests BA could keep falling, before the rebound gets back on track.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) General Electric (GE stock) logo on headquarters building\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is the former Dow Jones component I hinted at above. GE today is no longer as large and diversified as it once was. This calls into question whether it should be made a Dow stock once again.\n\nAdmittedly, sentiment for the industrial conglomerate has improved considerably since getting kicked out of the Dow in 2018. Yet while GE stock has crushed it over the past year (up by 75%), now may be the time to hit the \u201csell\u201d button.\n\nValuation is a problem as shares today trade for 32 times forward earnings. Similar to BA, GE is another aerospace play trading at a valuation that prices in a full post-Covid recovery as a near-certainty.\n\nAlso, GE\u2019s upcoming spinoff of its last non-aerospace segment could lead to a post-spinoff sell-off, as I argued earlier this month. After a year of smooth sailing, these factors could mean turbulence ahead.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp until recently, I\u2019d wager a considerable amount of investors would agree with me that IBM (NYSE:IBM) was one of the top blue-chip stocks to sell. In past years, a high dividend was not enough to counter weak growth and sideways price performance for the venerable tech stock.\n\nOver the past few months, however, the market\u2019s view of IBM stock has become much more upbeat. Mostly, due to recent financial results that suggest this company is starting to materially benefit from the generative AI boom.\n\nBut while \u201cAI mania\u201d is why IBM has roared higher, it\u2019s a good reason you should make IBM one of the blue-chips to sell. As I pointed out last month, one sell-side analyst (Jeffries\u2019 Brent Thill) argues that the sluggishness of IBM\u2019s legacy business could outweigh this AI growth. This in turn may cause the stock to become an underperformer once again.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPreviously, the market was taking a \u201cshow me\u201d stance on tech blue-chip Intel\u2018s (NASDAQ:INTC) turnaround. The turnaround centered on its efforts to become a large-scale chip foundry, or third-party manufacturer for \u201cfabless\u201d chip designers.\n\nHowever, since last fall, investors have bid up INTC stock, betting on a comeback built around booming demand for AI chips. Back in December, the company unveiled its newest line of chips for the generative AI market. So then, why INTC a blue-chip to sell? For one, with the stock trading for 32.2 times earnings, ahead of AI chip sales really boosting the bottom line, this catalyst may be overly priced-in.\n\nFurthermore, as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff pointed out earlier this month, recent developments cast doubt on whether Intel\u2019s big bet on foundries will move the needle as much as the company anticipates.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) has long been one of the blue-chip stocks to sell. Over the past five years, shares in this industrial conglomerate have fallen by around 55.75%. Don\u2019t blame this on sluggish growth but rather the fall-out from not one, but two multi-billion dollar lawsuits.\n\nEven as the company has finally settled this litigation, and despite the fact MMM stock now trades for only 9.6 times forward earnings, and sports a high dividend yield (6.54%), be sure to keep it in the \u201cstocks to sell\u201d category. For one, due to concerning earnings outlook for 2024.\n\nSecond, because of the still-elevated risk that this \u201cdividend king\u201d will have to implement a dividend cut. A dividend cut could help the stock in the long run, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued. Still, at the onset it would likely have a materially negative impact on MMM\u2019s price performance.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon (VZ) logo above the entrance to a Verizon store.\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) shares have been on a tear since mid-October. During this time frame, shares in the telecommunications giant have bounced back by around 34.4% off their 52-week low ($30.14 per share).\n\nBut whether you got in at this low, or even at higher prices, now may be the time to pull VZ stock from your blue-chip portfolio. Sure, Verizon may be cheap (at 8.8 times forward earnings), with a high dividend yield (6.55%) to boot. The company has also been reporting much stronger financial results.\n\nHowever, while cheap compared to stocks overall, VZ\u2019s valuation is premium to that of peers like AT&T (NYSE:T).

        "content": "In this piece, we will look at 50 Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More. In case you want to skip our detailed analysis on the realm of science in today\u2019s world, and Einstein\u2019s contribution to it, you can go directly to 5 Best Albert Einstein quotes about life and More.\n\nIn the realm of intellect and innovation, there existed a luminary whose brilliance transcended the boundaries of time. On April 18, 1955, Albert Einstein departed this world after a blood vessel near his heart ruptured. When offered the option of surgery, Einstein gracefully declined, declaring, \"I choose to depart on my terms. Prolonging life artificially lacks elegance. I have fulfilled my purpose; it is time to bid adieu.\" Following a post-mortem examination, Einstein's remains were cremated, and his ashes scattered in a location undisclosed. The globe mourned the loss of a visionary. In adherence to his wishes, his office and abode remained untouched by the shadow of memorials.\n\nAlbert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, and passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, U.S., was a renowned physicist whose research extended across various fields, from quantum mechanics to theories concerning gravity and motion. Following the publication of several seminal papers, Einstein embarked on a world tour, delivering lectures about his groundbreaking discoveries.

        "title": "Where Will IBM Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Five years ago, IBM(NYSE: IBM) was little more than a fading memory for most people. The end of the mainframe computer era and the rise of cloud computing left the aging company behind. The revenue decline that began all the way back in 2012 was still well underway as of 2019. Many investors left it for dead.\n\nWhat a difference five years makes! While IBM is still much smaller than it was then -- as measured by sales as well as profits -- the future looks promising. The organization has finally figured out how to remain relevant.\n\nThe question is, however, where will IBM and its stock be five years from now?\n\nMeet the new and improved IBM\n\nYounger investors may not believe it, but there was a time when IBM was the world's biggest company. And rightfully so. It just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the right technology -- the early days of personal computers.\n\nAs technology always does, however, it evolved. Mainframes and even desktop and laptop computers peaked, giving way to wireless internet, cloud computing, and mobile ways of connecting to networks. IBM just didn't keep up.\n\nA funny thing happened five years ago, though. IBM acquired cloud computing tech specialist Red Hat, thrusting the company into the then-gelling arena. Then, in 2020, the company took another big leap into the world of cloud computing. It named Arvind Krishna as its CEO. Krishna made no bones about his vision either, penning a letter to all employees shortly after he took the helm, asking them to maintain a \"maniacal focus on our open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities.\"\n\nAnd by and large, IBM's employees have done exactly that. Last year's hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence software platform revenue grew 5%, with Red Hat's piece of this business growing 7% year over year in the fourth quarter alone; its hybrid infrastructure arm experienced revenue growth of 7% year over year in Q4. Overall revenue improved a little more than 2% in 2023 despite economic turbulence that prompted some would-be customers to tighten their purse strings.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not enormous growth, but it's progress following fiscal progress in 2022 as well as comparable progress in 2021. Better still, this progress is trickling down to the bottom line. Last year's operating cash flow of $13.9 billion is $3.5 billion better than the prior year's figure, while free cash flow grew by $1.9 billion in 2023 to $11.2 billion. IBM Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAll of a sudden, IBM is interesting again. Ditto for the stock.\n\nIt's all about the multiplier\n\nIf you've not taken a close look at IBM within the past five years, much has changed, including the business model itself. Although he didn't dive into the numerical details in January's fourth-quarter earnings call, IBM's CFO Jim Kavanaugh explained, \"When we deploy $1 [worth of spending on hardware], we're looking for a multiplier of hardware, software services on top of that.\" In other words, the sale of one of its products drives the sale of other products and services.\n\nKavanaugh didn't offer updated specifics during Q4's conference call, but he has spoken about it before. Roughly a year ago, for instance, he noted that \"for every dollar of platform spend, clients spend $3 to $5 in software, and $6 to $8 in services.\" Those numbers likely still apply today.\n\nThe company's results bear this idea out, too. Infrastructure is no longer its biggest profit center. IBM's consulting arm (services) is a bit bigger than hardware, and software is a much bigger business than consulting. Image source: IBM's Q4-2023 investor report.\n\nThis matters -- maybe in a way few investors fully appreciate. Although profit margins on all of IBM's goods and services are strong, margins on software are huge at just under 80%. This is how the company's cash flow has grown so well when it seems like it shouldn't have. Image source: IBM's Q4 2023 investor report.\n\nThe other critical element in IBM's new business model is that much of it is recurring. Many of IBM's software and consulting customers pay a monthly fee for ongoing access to these tools. The company's recurring revenue tally now stands at an annualized figure of $14.4 billion, up 7% from the year-ago comparison. Software sales make up the biggest piece of this recurring revenue number, too, which, of course, is also IBM's most profitable arm.\n\nThe point is that this new business model works. It's also \"sticky\" in the sense that once an organization plugs into an IBM platform, it's then difficult to wean that organization off of it.\n\nLooking five years down the road\n\nBut what does this mean for the company and, by extension, for the stock going forward? All predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. Things can always change.\n\nAn analysis of the business dynamic and trends currently in place suggests IBM's future looks bright. The analyst community believes IBM's annual top line will swell to just under $78 billion by 2028 versus last year's $61.9 billion. Per-share profits are expected to grow from last year's $8.14 to $13.10 in 2027. That's roughly 5% annualized growth for both fiscal measures. And, given Mordor Intelligence's expectation that the global hybrid cloud computing market is set to grow at a yearly pace of 22% through 2029, there's little reason to think the market won't support at least that degree of growth from IBM.\n\nThe stock's price five years from now, however, is a tricky matter made even trickier by the fact that shares are currently trading slightly above the consensus target of $184.82. Just keep in mind that it's a one-year target; we're looking five years down the road. This simply means long-term-minded investors might want to wait for a modest pullback before taking the plunge. But, many true buy-and-hold investors will want to take that plunge sooner than later.\n\nAlthough it's anything but a growth stock now, and its glory days are clearly all in the past, IBM is relevant again. It's also profitable -- and increasingly so -- supporting a dividend that's not only been paid every quarter for over a century but a dividend that's been raised every year for the past 28 years. While a pullback from the stock would push its dividend yield a little higher, even at its current yield of 3.6%, income-seeking newcomers would still be doing better than they might with other dividend-paying stocks.\n\nIf you're looking for a guess, though, IBM stock could arguably be worth $280 per share five years from now. That's an annualized capital appreciation of about 9%, not counting the upside of the dividend payments it's going to dish out in the meantime.\n\nThat's just a guess, of course, albeit one that seems to make sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Will IBM Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?",
        "content": "IBM's (NYSE: IBM) market cap briefly eclipsed Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) back in Dec. 2011. At the time, both tech giants were worth just over $210 billion, and they were both struggling with the seismic shift toward mobile and cloud technologies. But today IBM is worth $168 billion, and Microsoft is worth $3.04 trillion.\n\nIBM struggled to expand its on-premise software, hardware, and IT service divisions as its enterprise customers pivoted toward cloud-based services, and it repeatedly reduced its annual revenue by divesting its weaker business segments. Microsoft countered those existential threats by aggressively expanding its Azure cloud infrastructure platform and shrewdly transforming its desktop software into cloud-based services and mobile apps. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIBM's mistakes were disappointing, but its CEO Arvind Krishna has made some sweeping changes since taking the helm in April 2020. Could those turnaround efforts breathe fresh life into Big Blue and turn it into a trillion-dollar company by 2030?\n\nHow is IBM fixing its business?\n\nKrishna's first major move was the divestment of IBM's slow-growth infrastructure services segment as Kyndryl in Nov. 2021. That divestment eliminated a major weight on the company's top-line and bottom-line growth and freed up more resources for the expansion of its higher-growth hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nKrishna was previously IBM's cloud chief, and he likely realized it was too late to catch up to Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google in the public cloud race. However, IBM could still leverage its existing enterprise presence to offer more hybrid cloud services -- which process the data that flows between the private and public clouds -- to companies that aren't quite ready to migrate all of their data to the public cloud. It could also roll out more AI services on its hybrid cloud to process all of that information.\n\nThat strategy relies heavily on Red Hat, the software maker it acquired for $34 billion in 2019. Red Hat develops open-source software that is universally compatible with a wide range of private and public cloud computing platforms. That flexible mix-and-match approach enables IBM to carve out its own niche and profit from the secular expansion of the cloud and AI markets without directly competing against Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nStory continues\n\nKrishna also restructured IBM's businesses into three simpler segments (software, consulting, and infrastructure), set a goal for generating \"mid-single-digit\" revenue growth from 2022 to 2024, streamlined the company's spending, and said it would replace thousands of its human employees with its own AI tools over the next few years.\n\nBut can single-digit growth create a trillion-dollar stock?\n\nIBM's revenue rose 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023, and analysts expect 3% growth in 2024. Its adjusted EPS grew 15% in 2022 and 5% in 2023, and is expected to rise 5% in 2024.\n\nThose growth rates indicate IBM's turnaround strategies are paying off and turning it into a reliable blue-chip tech stock again. It can also easily support its forward yield of 3.6%, since it only spent 54% of its free cash flow (FCF) on its dividends in 2023. Those attractive qualities brought the bulls back to IBM's stock -- which rallied more than 30% over the past 12 months, yet still looks cheap at 18 times forward earnings.\n\nNevertheless, IBM would still need to grow a lot faster to become a trillion-dollar stock by 2030. Assuming its valuation ratios hold steady, it would need to grow its adjusted EPS at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% from 2024 to 2030 to boost its market cap sixfold to $1 trillion. That would be a tough target for even higher-growth tech companies like Microsoft to achieve.\n\nBut IBM could still be a good long-term investment\n\nIBM probably won't follow Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet into the four-comma club anytime soon, but it's still a solid long-term investment. If IBM's multiple remains unchanged, it matches analysts' estimates, and it only grows its adjusted EPS at a CAGR of 5% from 2024 to 2030, it could still be worth $220 billion -- 30% higher than its current market cap -- by the final year. And with annual dividend hikes and reinvested dividends, IBM's stock could easily deliver a total return of 60%-70%.\n\nIf IBM grows at an even faster rate or commands a higher valuation, we could easily see its stock double by the end of the decade. In other words, Big Blue's strengths should outweigh its weaknesses for the foreseeable future -- even if it doesn't evolve into the next Microsoft or become a trillion-dollar stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average can be a great place to look if you\u2019re a beginner investor looking for some solid blue-chip ideas to put new money to work. Though the Dow Jones index may get quite a bit of flack for being a sub-par representation of the overall U.S. market, I still think the small sample size (30 components) makes it a bite-sized way for market newcomers to discover relatively secure stocks they\u2019d be willing to hang onto for the long haul. This has led to this list of dow stocks to buy.\n\nThough chasing Dow Jones laggards or leaders in any given year isn\u2019t going to guarantee solid returns (or even market returns), I still think the Dow Jones members are worth watching as they look to prove they\u2019re still worthy of staying in the incredibly old basket of large-cap American plays, many of whom have made big dents in their industries! Let\u2019s check out three intriguing (perhaps overlooked) Dow stocks on my radar this February.\n\nCisco (CSCO) Hand pointing up and to the right with blue arrow, symbolizes growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) disappointed many when it clocked in its latest quarterly earnings (Q2 2024) on Wednesday, with shares slipping just shy of 6% on what was a glorious comeback day for the broader markets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlongside the unimpressive quarter, the firm announced it\u2019s trimming its workforce by 5%, or just over 4,000. That\u2019s a massive layoff, to say the least, following up on big cuts made by other tech companies racing to reduce their workforces.\n\nThe tough times in tech are almost palpable at this point as the layoff contagion continues spreading through the industry at large. With revenue down 6% year over year, questions linger as to how the networking equipment maker can get back on the high track. With shares ultimately going nowhere over the past year, the patience of investors is sure to be put to the test as Cisco sails into its next round of earnings (Q3).\n\nFor now, massive job cuts, an ugly technical chart, and cautious full-year guidance are not helping build investor confidence in the old-time tech firm. In any case, the 3.1% dividend yield and freshly lowered bar make the Dow component worth a second look. Shares already look quite cheap at around 12.8 times forward price-to-earnings. And they could get much cheaper as investors digest the recent negative headlines. All in all, its one of those dow stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the bluest blue chips to play the rise of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). With deep pockets, a stake (and tight-knit partnership) with Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI, and an ever-improving Copilot AI service, your search for AI gems could easily stop at Microsoft.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has a lot going for it, some concerns could fuel the bear case over the coming quarters. First; the multiple is extended with shares going for 36.8 times trailing price-to-earnings at the time of writing. Some degree of premium is deserved for the $3 trillion AI frontrunner.\n\nThe company has talked a good talk. Now, it needs to walk a good walk. Though Copilot is an impressive AI service, questions linger as to its stickiness. Will customers continue to pay for the service, or will they just switch to one of the growing number of alternatives in the chatbot scene?\n\nSecond, Microsoft\u2019s decision to launch first-party Xbox games on PlayStation could be a net negative for Xbox sales. Either way, it seems Microsoft is headed to the cloud with its console.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s not forget that a Russia-led group hacked Microsoft earlier this year \u2014 a potential stain on the company\u2019s cybersecurity business.\n\nDespite the concerns, I still think the Dow stock is a staple in any portfolio. In fact, it\u2019s a must-hold of the mega-cap tech plays, in my opinion. It\u2019s the biggest AI innovator on the planet. I just wish shares were a bit cheaper!\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a tech company that was out of the conversation just a few years ago when almost nobody knew about OpenAI, ChatGPT, and the AI boom to come. Nowadays, the long-time Dow laggard is finally showing it can make up for lost time, thanks in part to the AI trend. Over the past year, shares are up around 35%. That\u2019s a big deal for a perennial underperformer who\u2019s struggled to stay with the other heavyweights in the tech world.\n\nWith Watson AI and various other AI initiatives working their magic, IBM is a tech stock that has finally shown it deserves your full attention. As AI helps improve IBM\u2019s quarterly results, don\u2019t be so surprised if IBM joins the conversation alongside the Magnificent Seven and other impressive AI tech players in the near future.\n\nWith a 22.5 times trailing price-to-earnings multiple and a nice 3.62% dividend yield, I still find the stock to be misunderstood by many. For 2024, look for more AI strength to make the previously-forgotten tech stock an unforgettable member of the Dow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Microsoft.

        "title": "KKR and Malibu Boats have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 16, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares KKR & Co. KKR as the Bull of the Day and Malibu Boats MBUU as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Dell Technologies DELL, Qualcomm QCOM and IBM IBM.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nKKR & Co. is a leading global investment firm, with a long and successful history in the private equity industry. KKR & Co. operates a diversified platform across three primary segments: Private Equity, Credit, and Alternative Asset Management.\n\nOver the last ten years these businesses have been booming, and KKR has executed the strategies with some of the best returns across the industry. Such success has led to annualized returns of 34% over the last five years, considerably outperforming many of its competitors and the broad market.\n\nFor the average retail investor, access to private equity, credit and alternative investment opportunities are extremely limited. But with KKR now trading as a public company, any investor can get access to these powerful opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, KKR & Co. currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, further increasing the odds of a near-term rally in the share price.\n\nHere, I will highlight several further bullish factors powering KKR stock and share why it makes for a worthy consideration in many investors' portfolios.\n\nEarnings Estimates: Perking Up\n\nThe proprietary methodology used at Zacks is one of the most powerful techniques there is for picking stocks as it aggregates the earnings estimates of all analysts' forecasts. The strategy has been quantitatively tested and shows strong market outperformance over the long term.\n\nKKR & Co. boasts the highest Zacks Rank, with nearly all analysts covering the stock upgrading the EPS outlook over the last two months.\n\nCurrent quarter earnings estimates have increased by 9.5% over the last two months and are expected to climb 42% YoY to $1.15 per share. FY24 earnings estimates have been boosted by 3.6% and are projected to jump 43.3% YoY to $4.90 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nKKR's topline is set to expand nicely over the next two years as well, with sales forecast to grow 17.9% this year and 18.2% next year.\n\nValuation: Cheap Based on Growth Estimates\n\nKKR is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 21.7x, which is about in line with the broad market. However, because of KKR's exceptional EPS growth estimates, the stock is potentially undervalued.\n\nEPS at the asset manager are forecast to grow 25% annually over the next 3-5 years. Not only is this an impressive growth rate, but because its below the forward earnings multiple it means its PEG Ratio is below 1x, indicating undervalued status based on the metric.\n\nKKR currently has a PEG Ratio of 0.86x.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPrivate equity and KKR's other businesses are very strong business models and are executed at the highest level. This means investors can now access these strategies as easily as buying an ETF.\n\nThe advantages of these strategies are numerous as well. Private equity is known for offering lower volatility than public markets, potentially higher returns, and uses active management to identify the best business opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, Credit and Alternative Assets offer additional diversification from equities. Credit provides regular income through lending, and Alternatives give exposure to projects like infrastructure.\n\nKKR & Co. is trading at an appealing valuation, with a powerful business model, and upward trending earnings revisions. Because of these multitude of bullish catalysts, I think investors can consider investing in KKR at current levels.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nMalibu Boats, a leading designer and manufacturer of sport boats, is bumping into some considerable slowdowns in top and bottom-line expectations, giving it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.\n\nThe bout of consumer exuberance which followed the Covid-19 lockdown pulled forward considerable buying of large-ticket items like boats. Because of this, sales at Malibu Boats jumped well above trend and while it was welcome at the time, is limiting sales over the next year or two.\n\nAs buying a boat is not something that is done regularly, the company is likely to see a slowdown in growth moving forward and should be avoided for now.\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nThe dynamic troubling Malibu Boats has not been missed by analysts, as they have unanimously lowered earnings estimates for the company. Current quarter sales have been revised lower by -53% over the last two months and are projected to fall -71% YoY to just $0.77 per share. FY24 earnings estimates have been lowered by -37% and are expected to fall -43% YoY.\n\nTop-line growth is expected to tank in the coming year. Current quarter sales are expected to decline -39% YoY to $228 million and FY24 by -32% to $940 million.\n\nIt seems every time I come back to this stock both sales and earnings estimates have been revised lower.\n\nValuation\n\nWhat concerns me further is that even with the falling top and bottom line, Malibu Boats still has a historically premium valuation. With a one year forward earnings multiple of 14.9x, it is almost 50% above its five-year median of 9.9x.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile Malibu Boats is experiencing near-term challenges, the stock is by no means a zero. However, based on the current setup, I think investors should seek out other opportunities in the market.\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Tech Stocks to Buy for Passive Income\n\nTechnology's momentum is undeniably attractive to investors, with the high-flying sector delivering notable gains and boosting sentiment over the last year. In fact, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector has gained nearly 48% over the period compared to the S&P 500's impressive 25% gain.\n\nInvestors also love dividends, as they provide a nice buffer against drawdowns and provide a passive income stream, undoubtedly a solid pairing. And for those seeking exposure to both technology and dividends, three stocks \u2013 Dell Technologies, Qualcomm and IBM\u2013 fit the criteria nicely.\n\nOn top of rewarding shareholders with quarterly payouts, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting optimism among analysts. Let's take a closer look at each.\n\nDell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), provides information technology solutions. The company's shares currently yield 1.7% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 26% of its earnings.\n\nThe outlook for its current fiscal year has been notably positive, with the $6.66 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 8% over the last year. Better-than-expected quarterly results over the last year have helped drive share performance, with DELL exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 36% across its last four releases.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company's growth is expected to cool in its current fiscal year (FY24), with consensus expectations alluding to a 12% pullback in earnings on 13% lower sales.\n\nQualcomm\n\nQualcomm, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), designs, manufactures, and markets digital wireless telecom products and services based on the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. Analysts have bumped their earnings expectations higher across the board.\n\nQCOM shares pay investors nicely, currently yielding 2.1% annually. The company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, as reflected by its 6.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nThe company's latest set of quarterly results came in above expectations, posting a 15% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reporting sales 4.5% ahead of the consensus. Headline numbers exceeded the high end of prior guidance, with the company also returning $1.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividend payouts.\n\nIBM\n\nIBM, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is an information technology (IT) company. Analysts have moved their earnings expectations higher across the board over the last several months. Shares presently yield 3.6% annually, crushing the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 0.6%.\n\nIBM's latest set of quarterly results came in above expectations, with Software sales climbing 8% year-over-year as customers increasingly adopt its watsonx AI and data platform. Cash-generating abilities also saw a notable boost, with operating cash flow of $3.1 billion well higher than the $1.9 billion mark in the year-ago period.\n\nIBM shares have moved higher post-earnings in back-to-back releases.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDividend-paying stocks don't always have to be 'boring,' as many exciting companies from the technology sector also reward their shareholders with payouts.\n\nAnd for those interested in gaining exposure to the sector paired with quarterly payouts, all three stocks above fit the criteria nicely.\n\nOn top of quarterly payouts, all three currently sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting positive outlooks among analysts.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks offer more stability and less risk than companies in high-growth phases that are burning through cash. These types of stocks can reward long-term investors while having less volatility than most equities.\n\nWhile some blue-chip stocks fall behind the stock market in the long run, other blue-chip stocks continue to outperform. Investors looking for some promising investment opportunities may want to consider these picks.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has established itself as a healthier fast-food restaurant among the available choices. That branding choice helped the company reverse decelerating revenue growth and deliver an exceptional fourth quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring\u00a0Q4 2023, the company increased revenue by 15.4% year-over-year. That\u2019s higher than the company\u2019s full-year revenue increase of 14.3% year-over-year. Chipotle also saw a 27.3% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Chipotle\u2019s $282.1 million in net income was enough to secure an 11.3% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle also opened 121 new restaurants. It\u2019s no surprise that 110 of those restaurants included a Chipotlane, which has been a growth driver for the company.\n\nChipotle has been a rewarded long-term pick for investors. The equity is up by 44% over the past year and has surged by 327% over the past five years. Shares of the fast food restaurant currently trade at a 47 forward P/E ratio.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office building\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a staple in many funds and continues to deliver exceptional returns for long-term investors. The stock has outperformed the market over the past year and over the past five years. It\u2019s a pivotal stock for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.\n\nMicrosoft has several growth verticals that have consistently produced revenue growth and profits. The tech giant has meaningful exposure in cloud computing, social media, advertising, artificial intelligence, gaming, and other industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft delivered 18% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q2 FY24 with cloud revenue being a standout. That segment experienced 24% year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft has been winning new customers by infusing artificial intelligence into its entire tech stack. For instance,\u00a0Copilot is an AI assistant that helps businesses and individuals navigate Microsoft Office products more efficiently.\n\nThe company\u00a0invested in a Super Bowl ad for Copilot which shows it is serious about its latest AI product.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Watch for Dips, Because Amazon Stock Is a Buy Amid the Market Chaos\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to grow at a fast pace. E-commerce sales showed resilience as the company reported a 14% year-over-year revenue increase in Q4 2023. Amazon Web Services also had a better quarter than the prior one and grew by 13% year-over-year.\n\nAmazon had a record-breaking holiday season and saw elevated growth in international markets. The company\u2019s generative AI capabilities offer an exciting growth opportunity. The company\u2019s\u00a0Bedrock makes it easier for developers to scale AI applications. This resource will increase demand for Amazon Web Services and can further fuel the stock.\n\nAmazon has been pacing the stock market with a 70% gain over the past year. Shares are up by 115% over the past five years. North American sales are still the\u00a0lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s total net sales. Amazon can still generate more growth by tapping into international markets. The company has exposure to multiple verticals and seems likely to reward long-term investors.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A Procter & Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) produces many essential home products and has a portfolio of household brands. The stock doesn\u2019t offer tremendous upside but is still respectable. Shares are up by 14% over the past year and have gained 60% over the past five years.\n\nWhile other companies can outperform PG stock, few equities can compare to the consumer goods company\u2019s dividend payouts. Procter & Gamble has been giving out dividends for\u00a0133 consecutive years. That includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. The asset has a 2.40% dividend yield.\n\nProcter & Gamble reported mild earnings, which is to be expected from a mature blue-chip stock. Revenue increased by 3% year-over-year in\u00a0Q2 FY24 while core EPS increased by 16% year-over-year. These aren\u2019t groundbreaking gains, but they show that the company is still expanding its market share.\n\nThe company is more resilient during recessions since consumers will reduce other expenses before trimming essential products. It can be a useful equity for a conservative investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) has been outperforming Visa (NYSE:V) in recent months. A meaningful rally has resulted in a 1-year gain of 25%. The stock has gained 106% over the past five years.\n\nThe credit and debit card firm reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Net income reached $2.8 billion, which represents an 11% year-over-year growth rate. Mastercard had higher revenue growth than Visa but lagged in net income growth. Both financial firms offer impressive growth rates.\n\nMichael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard, cited healthy consumer spending and strong growth in cross-border volume when commenting on earnings. Mastercard closed out 2023 by repurchasing $9.0 billion worth of shares and distributing $2.2 billion in dividends.\n\nMastercard\u2019s dividend yield is a low 0.60%, but\u00a0historical dividend growth has been incredible. The firm started 2024 by hiking its quarterly dividend from $0.57 per share to $0.66 per share. This growth is a 15.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a reliable retailer that is tapping into e-commerce and international markets for additional growth opportunities. E-commerce sales rallied by 15% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023 while overall sales increased by 5.2% year-over-year.\n\nWalmart\u2019s e-commerce growth has been stronger in domestic markets while retail store revenue growth has been higher in international markets. The company\u2019s global advertising revenue jumped by 20% year-over-year. While this is an exciting development because of higher margins and a good growth rate, advertising makes up a small percentage of Walmart\u2019s total sales.\n\nWalmart offers lower volatility than most of the stock market because of its\u00a00.49 beta. The S&P 500 has a 1.00 beta. The company also offers more protection during a recession since the retailer specializes in offering affordable goods and services.\n\nThe stock can also rally when the economy is booming. Shares are up by 69% over the past five years.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter languishing for several years and yielding a lost decade for some investors,\u00a0IBM (NYSE:IBM) is righting the ship. Shares are up by 37% over the past year and offer a 3.55% dividend yield.\n\nThe firm closed out the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023 with 4% year-over-year revenue growth. The company has experienced more demand for its hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence offerings.\n\nWhile other AI stocks have soared much higher than IBM, the company only trades at a 23 P/E ratio. The company\u2019s forward P/E ratio is currently 18.50. The reinvented company\u2019s net income increased by 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\n\nIBM anticipates achieving mid-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth in 2024. The firm also expects to generate $12 billion in free cash flow. Other tech companies will outperform this stock and it is unlikely to outperform index funds. However, investors looking for more stability during economic uncertainty may want to consider this pick.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "Top 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 most valuable blockchain companies in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the global blockchain industry, its current status, and the latest news, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024.\n\nWith the first quarter of the 21st century about to be over, the Internet of today is vastly different from the one that had taken shape at the tail end of the dotcom era of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Now, the Internet proliferates every aspect of life, whether it's transportation, work, entertainment, leisure, or even buying groceries. Additionally, two and a half decades after the start of the new century, a handful of players since the dotcom era have survived and now reign supreme in the stock market.\n\nThese bigwigs include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, 2024 is turning out to be a year that appears to be challenging the dominance of big technology as the market value of the semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has started to rival that of the world's biggest electronic commerce company Amazon and Alphabet, whose search engine reigns supreme in nearly every country in the world.\n\nThe significant transformation that the Internet has undergone over the course of the past decades also means that now, there are new technologies and industries that were un-thought of when Jeff Bezos first started delivering books. One such technology is blockchain, a secure ledger that gained popularity along with Bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency. The emergence of blockchain technologies, companies, and stocks comes as technology permeates not only our daily lives but also the business operations of giants belonging to crucial industries such as financial services and logistics.\n\nA blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers that store information. And since running a business requires storing copious amounts of information, it offers companies and management a secure ledge that is stored on multiple computers at the same time to ensure that even if one node of the network goes out of operation, the record integrity remains unaffected.\n\nStory continues\n\nNaturally, this utility that the blockchain industry has slowly grown to be worth quite a bit. For instance, as part of our coverage of 11 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts, we discovered several blockchain stocks that had impressive share price upside. The top three stocks in this list, which ranked the companies by the percentage upside of their average analyst share price targets as of mid December 2023, were Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR). The share price upside percentage for these blockchain stocks all stood in either double or triple digits, indicating that when it comes to selecting blockchain stocks for investment purposes, at least analysts believe that they offer at least some potential.\n\nDelving deeper into the business operations of these top blockchain stocks, it appears that at least when it comes to the top of the food chain for investment recommendations, either companies that sell hardware for blockchain use or those that engage in Bitcoin mining reign supreme. Bitcoin and blockchains are closely tied to each other, since at its simplest level, a Bitcoin is simply a reward token to a miner given for computing resources spent powering up a blockchain network.\n\nThe next step in our analysis of the blockchain industry and the biggest blockchain companies is to see whether this trend also holds for the most valuable blockchain companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Some of the most valuable companies, when it comes to either operating blockchains or offering software based products that use the technology are International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThis is unsurprising since all these companies are leaders in the cloud computing space, and each of them offers blockchain based services as well. So while Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of Web3, a 'new' internet that seeks to run on the blockchain, Alphabet's Google Cloud has been storing Bitcoin mining data for years and the firm itself has invested billions of dollars in the blockchain industry. Similarly, IBM is one of the biggest players in the blockchain industry since it offers companies the ability to build blockchain systems across a myriad of industries such as supply chain management and food product sourcing.\n\nAs a whole, now that Bitcoin has touched the coveted $1 trillion mark, the next Bitcoin halving is due soon to allow even more miners to profit in the industry, retail players are able to access Bitcoin through exchange traded funds, new areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) capture the public attention, and GPU supply chain stabilizes in the wake of increased A.I. demand, the blockchain industry might be in for some favorable tailwinds in the coming months.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest blockchain companies in the world. Some notable names are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Top 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet on a modern touchscreen device displaying a graph of the company's assets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the biggest blockchain companies in the world, we first made a list of the firms that either mine Bitcoin, offer data center space to Bitcoin or associated companies, or offer blockchain related services. Then, the firms were analyzed to see whether blockchain or blockchain related products and services represent their key business operations or if the industry would find it difficult to function if their products went off the market. This meant that while Microsoft and Amazon do offer these products, they were excluded since their core business operations focus on other industries; but, it also meant that a GPU firm made the cut. Finally, the remaining companies were ranked by their market capitalization and the biggest blockchain companies were as follows.\n\nTop 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024\n\n2o.

        "title": "AI means restaurants might soon know what you want to order before you do",
        "content": "With sweeping views of lower Manhattan behind him, entrepreneur Danny Meyer shares a futuristic vision of a restaurant that would know almost everything about the way we like to dine.\n\nWhat if a restaurant could know exactly what a guest likes to eat? What are your favorite wines? Do you even drink wine? How long do you like to dine? Do you order dessert? And with that knowledge, it could tailor a customized experience that satisfies the senses.\n\n\"By taking the guesswork out of the actual technical part of taking your order, it allows us to put 100% of our hearts into making you feel welcome,\u201d says Meyer, speaking at an event hosted by IBM at Manhatta, a fine dining restaurant owned by his Union Square Hospitality Group.\n\nThe Shake Shack founder says artificial intelligence can bring three key benefits to hospitality: increased revenue because restaurants will know more about their guests and how they like to spend, efficiencies to supply-chain and other back-office operations, and helping restaurants provide greater hospitality by focusing more on guests and less on mundane tasks.\n\n\u201cAny great tech should advance touch,\u201d says Meyer. \u201cAnd I think hospitality is all about human touch.\u201d\n\nWe now use our phones to order a coffee while out for a walk or track a delivery driver to the precise moment they will reach our doorstep. Robots are making burrito bowls at Chipotle and Sweetgreen\u2019s salads. And AI is the latest innovation that\u2019s upending how restaurants and diners interact.\n\nMuch of the focus has been on AI-powered tools that recommend add-ons to an order. McDonald\u2019s and IBM are using AI for drive-through orders, though the response on social media last year was lukewarm. IBM acquired McD Tech Labs from the world\u2019s largest fast-food restaurant chain in 2021, and together, they\u2019ve greatly lifted order automation rates where the tech has been deployed, giving recommendations that are a bit more sophisticated than \u201cDo you want a larger size of fries?\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt is really about reducing friction,\u201d says Rob Thomas, IBM\u2019s senior vice president of software and chief commercial officer. \"I believe every company in the world is going to use generative AI for some type of customer service, which is happening pretty significantly today.\"\n\nBut there are limits. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical that AI is going to disrupt or replace creative-type jobs,\u201d Thomas tells Fortune. \u201cI think chefs are all safe.\u201d\n\nIn November, Yum Brands chief financial officer Chris Turner told investors the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell operator is testing voice-enabled AI drive-throughs in two California restaurants to boost productivity and efficiency, while generating automated upsell recommendations.\n\nDine Brands\u2019 IHOP chain debuted AI recommendation technology for online ordering in August. Google Cloud utilizes years of content across the tech giant\u2019s ads, search, and YouTube to encourage an online order of a steak burger with bacon to perhaps add on a milkshake. Or a side of pancakes to a breakfast order with IHOP.\n\nAbout 20% of IHOP\u2019s business today comes from off premise, a shift in spending that was initially fueled by the pandemic but remains persistent. Kieran Donahue, IHOP\u2019s chief marketing officer, says the chain makes decisions based on the guest perspective, and that\u2019s led to an evolution of the company\u2019s digital strategy, including a loyalty program last year and updates to the website and IHOP app.\n\n\u201cWhen you sit in our restaurant and you have a dining experience, our servers are there to help you make some decisions and offer you some suggestions,\u201d says Donahue. \u201cThis recommendation engine that we are testing is a bit of a service experiment. It is providing a level of digital service that you might equate to dine-in.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether a user is a loyalty member or not, Google Cloud\u2019s Recommendations AI model is meant to offer a variety of upsell options, which can range from seasonal items to specials to items purchased previously. \u201cUltimately, the AI engine and the recommendation engine are providing meaningful recommendations for both of those users,\u201d says Jason Suarez, vice president of digital, business intelligence, and CRM engineering at Dine Brands.\n\nWith nearly 800 locations across 34 states, Checkers and Rally\u2019s began rolling out AI-based drive-thru voice ordering in mid-2021, an investment the company claims made it the first large restaurant concept to utilize AI in this way. Today, over 350 corporate and franchised stores have deployed AI at the drive-through, and over the summer, Checkers added a Spanish-speaking feature.\n\nAI won\u2019t be deployed to every location, as some restaurants don\u2019t have a drive-through or high enough volume to justify the cost of adding AI.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is you don\u2019t innovate just to say you are innovating,\u201d says Minh Le, chief information officer at Checkers and Rally\u2019s. \u201cThere has to be a purpose and return. Technology costs money.\u201d\n\nLe leaned on AI to help automate some tasks that would make the cashier position less stressful. It is a job where an employee is taking orders, while at the same time processing payments at the window, handing food to customers, and filling drink orders. Burnout can result in low retention. But with as much as 95% of orders automated by AI, cashiers can \u201cfocus on the customer at the window and provide better service,\u201d says Le.\n\nAI experimentation isn\u2019t limited to large chains. In Kenya, the generative AI craze caught the attention of hospitality entrepreneur Shamim Ehsani. He began to tinker with the tech personally, but quickly utilized it to center the creative concept for a new Thai-style restaurant he would open in Nairobi, called BangBang.\n\nBangBang is named after a Muay Thai champion and Hollywood star, whose photos and bio adorn the restaurant\u2019s website and branding. But he isn\u2019t real. BangBang is a completely fictional character, a backstory and images all created by AI, which also helped Ehsani with graphic design, logos, and color choices for the restaurant.\n\nEhsani used Midjourney for the image generation and would ask ChatGPT questions such as \u201cWhat colors would be good for a Thai restaurant?\u201d and \u201cWhat fonts should I use for the menu?\u201d And because Ehsani isn\u2019t formally trained on Adobe, he says, AI tools can help supplement some of his technical deficiencies. \u201cWith AI, I think it really helps to build on my creativity so that I can deliver what I have in my mind,\u201d says Ehsani.\n\nThe use of those new AI tools has led to some intellectual property concerns, and Ehsani admits the line is blurred. \u201cWe tell our guests that the images are AI-generated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be upfront and honest about how we use technology and weave it into the guest\u2019s journey.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that is red hot right now. Machine learning is a technology that enables computers to emulate how humans learn and adapt by combining data and experience. It began in earnest back in the 1950s, led by IBM (NYSE:IBM), whose scientists coined the term. Today, machine learning is training AI models and applications, teaching them how to collect, collate and communicate information back to us humans. Given the massive potential of AI, machine learning has become a fast-growing segment of technology.\n\nFortune Business Insights forecasted the global market for machine learning will grow from $26.03 billion in 2023 to $225.91 billion by 2030 for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. As the market takes off, let\u2019s look at how to get rich quickly with these three machine learning stocks to buy now.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) uses machine learning to power its software that specializes in workflow management. The company essentially uses machine learning to help its customers eliminate mundane tasks, helping to improve workplace productivity in the process. The company has been reporting strong growth in recent quarters due to growing demand for its machine learning products and also its new AI offerings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nServiceNow has developed 15 new generative AI tools over the last year and is achieving up to 40% productivity gains as a result. The company said its recent fourth-quarter 2023 earnings were given a boost by the rollout of new AI software that works in combination with machine learning. ServiceNow primarily makes money from subscription revenues and sees those rising substantially this year. NOW stock is up 68% over the last 12 months, including an 11% gain year-to-date.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla cars\n\nTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) self-driving car features rely entirely on machine learning. While self-driving vehicles are controversial and potentially dangerous, they\u2019re likely the future of the automotive industry. Emulating the many split-second decisions that a human driver makes is complex and requires the most advanced machine learning available. Tesla is a true pioneer in this area, and the company\u2019s \u201cAutopilot and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d features are leaders when it comes to self-driving vehicle technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Tesla is currently developing a new supercomputer called Dojo. The company claims it will use machine learning to train AI models and further develop and enhance its self-driving vehicle technologies. Tesla announced plans to spend more than $1 billion on the continued development of this new supercomputer. Company CEO Elon Musk also continues to talk up the importance of AI and the need for Tesla to expand its footprint in the space. TSLA stock is up nearly 800% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) microchips and semiconductors are powering the machine learning and AI revolution that\u2019s now underway. The supercomputers that run machine learning and train AI models require massive amounts of information and circuitry, and Nvidia\u2019s high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) perform the task better than any other company.

Not only that but biotech companies developing disease cures and shipping companies trying to maximize their supply chains are too. Nvidia\u2019s next earnings print is scheduled for Feb. 21 and promises to be another blockbuster. NVDA has risen 234% over the last 12 months, including a nearly 50% increase so far this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "content": "Shares of International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) are finally trading at multiyear highs after a long and painful period in the doldrums. Big Blue started shifting its business strategy in 2012 under then-CEO Ginni Rometty, but many investors were uncomfortable with sacrificing revenue growth in order to refocus on future growth markets such as cloud computing, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSo here we are in 2024, those exact target markets are the hottest areas of the digital arena, and IBM's stock has finally been given a ticket to climb aboard the broader stock market's AI bandwagon. Thanks to a stellar fourth-quarter report, with more than a dash of AI orders, IBM stock is trading at prices not seen since the summer of 2014.\n\nIBM's commitment to AI is starting to pay off, and the company's AI-powered, cloud-based growth story has only just begun. The success story so far is the tip of a much larger iceberg. It may have been a bit late to Wall Street's AI party, but I expect a massive growth spurt from this tech sector stalwart.\n\nA B2B focus demands patience\n\nAt this point, IBM has spent more than a decade whittling itself down from its former one-stop-shop approach into a sleeker, more efficient bundle of high-growth operations. Pointing such a huge business in a new direction takes time and patience. It's like an oil tanker making a U-turn in San Francisco Bay -- a slow operation requiring great care.\n\nThis level of patience also applies to IBM's day-to-day operations. Big Blue is happy to let other companies fight among themselves to cater to fickle consumer tastes.\n\nIBM is all about business-to-business services. Once you win a multiyear contract in this market segment, you'll have a reliable revenue stream for a long time. Moreover, corporate deals tend to be lucrative, with generous profit margins and side orders of technical support services.\n\nNothing good is ever free, and there's a significant downside to IBM's tight enterprise focus. It takes a while to get the necessary John Hancocks on a large, long-lasting software contract. A prospective client must put the new tool through the paces by testing its functionality, security, integration with existing systems, and more. Then, the company's IT director may need budget sign-offs from several layers of management. Moreover, AI platforms can be controversial, slowing down the process even further.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it's not surprising to see IBM's AI wins are coming in a bit late. The company is taking the long way around to this opportunity. On the upside, there will be large, fruitful, and durable contracts at the end of the rainbow.\n\nWhat makes IBM's AI solutions special?\n\nBig Blue isn't building another multipurpose ChatGPT platform. Its solutions are aimed at enterprise-class corporations that have the developer know-how to apply AI analytics and deep learning to their proprietary business data.\n\nIBM also goes the extra mile to explain how its AI systems reach their conclusions. That's the only way to deliver business-grade insights. Thanks to Watson's transparency, a client can audit the analysis and make sure the AI conclusions are based on good data. Clients can trust those audited analyses more than they would an AI solution that came from a black box the inner workings of which are inscrutable.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race\n\nEven now, with AI orders piling up and driving deeper market interest in IBM's Watson and Watsonx solutions, IBM won't become a get-rich-quick stock. Converting firm service contracts (including the modern software-as-a-service approach to software licenses) doesn't result in big lump sums on the income statement right away. Instead, recurring revenue streams are collected from customers on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. So the impressive volume of AI orders coming down IBM's pipeline will look more like a slow groundswell of modest growth in revenues and profits.\n\nBut you know what they say about successful investing: It's a marathon, not a sprint. IBM is taking its sweet time cementing the foundation of an incredibly lucrative AI business, and I don't mind that at all. It's a much smarter strategy than rushing the process and losing out on a robust tide of long-lasting AI deals.\n\nIBM's AI success was decades in the making, but these are the early days of its financial impact. The stock still trades at just 2.7 times sales and 13.6 times free cash flow, making it a red-tag value play next to AI darlings such as Nvidia or Microsoft. IBM stock could double or triple in price and still look like a bargain by comparison.\n\nFinally, you know IBM was built to last. The company has been around since the 1800s, deftly switching target markets to stay relevant and profitable through a plethora of sea changes and calamities. The AI shift is another example of this shareholder-friendly management approach. And don't forget that you can lock in a generous 3.6% dividend yield right now, backed by mountains of cash profits and 28 straight years of annual payout boosts.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, IBM looks ready to make money for us ordinary investors forever.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "3 Compelling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Risk-Averse Investors Can Feel Safe Buying",
        "content": "Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) has become lucrative and risky. Stocks such as Nvidia and Palantir could revolutionize AI, but they also sell at valuations that make them increasingly risky choices.\n\nHowever, not all AI stocks have become expensive in the past year. These three companies play critical roles in AI, but trade at valuations that will allow risk-averse investors to buy in now without overpaying.\n\nIBM\n\nNow that International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has become a leader in the cloud, it is probably time to consider adding it to your portfolio. The company's move into the hybrid cloud and the spinoff of its underperforming managed infrastructure business as a new company, Kyndryl, have changed the outlook for this tech stock.\n\nIBM has also developed AI solutions. Among its products is Watsonx, which helps users build foundation models, scale AI workloads from its data store, and monitor AI lifecycles in their entirety. Moreover, IBM Research and the company's team of consultants can also help clients deploy AI across their organizations.\n\nIncome investors will like IBM's payout. With a dividend of $6.64 per share yearly, at current share prices, it offers a yield of 3.6%, and the company has a 27-year streak of annual payout hikes. This makes it the dividend stock in the cloud space, since its peers either provide more modest payouts or don't pay dividends at all.\n\nAlso, after years of decline and stagnation, the stock has begun to come back. Over the last year, it is up more than 35% and could soon return to the all-time high it touched in 2013. Yet even after those gains, it trades at a P/E ratio of 23, a bargain valuation compared to many AI stocks today. Given these factors, investors may want to buy shares of IBM before they become significantly more expensive.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nAdmittedly, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- aka, TSMC -- may not seem like a low-risk pick. Recently, all stocks tied to China, on some level, have struggled with growth. Investors like Warren Buffett have exited their positions in TSMC out of fear of the possibility that China might invade Taiwan, which is home to most of the company's chip fabrication facilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, almost every chip design company depends on TSMC for its manufacturing. Thus, companies such as Nvidia and AMD face this same risk, even though it is likely not priced into their stocks. Secondly, China also depends on TSMC's chips, making it less likely it would put its economy at risk with an invasion.\n\nInvestors may have started to notice as TSMC stock has risen more than 40% over the past year. That has taken its P/E ratio to 26. While its earnings multiple has significantly increased over the previous few months, TSMC routinely traded at more than 30 times earnings during the 2021 bull market.\n\nAlso, analysts forecast a 10% surge in profits for this year and a 23% increase in 2025. Those factors should put upward pressure on the semiconductor stock as TSMC produces more of the chips that will power the AI revolution.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) is one of only three nationwide 5G wireless providers in the U.S. This positions it as one of the few wireless telecoms that can provide a critical link for numerous AI applications.\n\nMoreover, it was founded in 1994, and unlike Verizon Communications and AT&T, it started as a wireless provider. As such, T-Mobile does not have legacy costs such as pensions, nor does it face extensive environmental cleanup costs from old lead-lined cables -- just two of the concerns that are currently plaguing those competitors. Data sources: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, Strategy Analytics, FierceWireless, Statista estimates. Image source: Statista.\n\nFor these reasons, it has long been free to spend its capital on its wireless networks and acquisitions, and to offer price cuts that have squeezed the profit margins of its peers. All of this has allowed T-Mobile to grow its market share to around 24%.\n\nAlthough T-Mobile's share price rose only 12% last year, the telecom stock outperformed its peers. It has also risen by nearly 875% since its inception, making it more of a growth stock. TMUS Chart\n\nHowever, its P/E ratio of 23 is low by historical standards. Also, since it initiated a dividend in December, more conservative investors might take an interest. At $2.60 per share annually, its 1.6% cash return is dwarfed by the greater than 6% dividend yields of AT&T and Verizon.\n\nNonetheless, its payout could act as a stabilizing force for T-Mobile over time, and with stock price growth supplementing returns, it should continue to outpace its peers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 highest yielding dividend stocks in the Dow. You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow.\n\nDividend yield holds significant importance in dividend investing, serving as a key metric for investors. Experts often recommend prioritizing companies that demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payouts over time. Nevertheless, there is also notable interest among investors in companies offering high dividend yields. Over time, high-yielding stocks and companies with consistent dividend growth have demonstrated comparable performance, showing a close race in their investment returns. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series employs a distinctive methodology aimed at tracking the performance of 100 stocks with high dividend yields across various markets. These stocks are chosen based on their consistent history of dividend payments and strong fundamental metrics. Over the long term, this index has demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains compared to standard benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index achieved an annualized total return of 11.7%, surpassing its benchmark, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which yielded 10.2% annually. Similarly, in the international market, the Dow Jones International Dividend 100 Index outperformed its benchmark, the S&P Global Ex-U.S. LargeMidCap, in both price return and total return over the past 15 years.\n\nHeartland Advisors conducted an in-depth analysis utilizing data provided by Kenneth French, sourced from the US Stock Database Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. This dataset encompassed all equity securities listed on major US exchanges, including NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ, and NYSE Arca, spanning from 1928 through 2017. The study focused on examining monthly and annual value-weighted total returns of non-dividend-paying U.S. stocks and five portfolios consisting of dividend-paying stocks. These portfolios were constructed based on dividend yields. The research tracked the performance of each portfolio from January 1928 to December 2017, with dividends reinvested. Notably, the findings revealed that all portfolios comprising dividend-paying stocks outperformed the portfolio comprised solely of non-dividend-paying stocks over the entire period studied. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, in general, portfolios with higher dividend yields tended to outperform those with lower dividend yields. This suggests a positive correlation between dividend yield and investment performance, with higher-yielding quintiles demonstrating stronger returns compared to lower-yielding quintiles.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe impressive performance of high-yielding dividend stocks has garnered significant popularity among investors, leading many to turn to the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a key source for such investment opportunities. Employing a strategy known as the 'Dogs of the Dow', investors focus on acquiring the highest-yielding stocks within the DJIA. The outcomes of this strategy have been varied and inconsistent over time. According to data sourced from Barron's in one of our articles, over a 20-year period ending in 2023, the Dogs of the Dow strategy yielded an average annual return slightly above 8%, inclusive of dividends. This performance lags behind the S&P 500 by a little over 1% annually. However, when assessing the period from the end of 2003 to 2018, the Dogs of the Dow were actually outperforming the S&P 500 by approximately 1% each year.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) are some of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow among others that are discussed below in this article. 13 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow\n\nPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best quality dividend stocks to invest in. You can skip our detailed analysis of quality dividend companies and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Quality Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIn a volatile stock market, income-generating stocks hold a significant position. While tech stocks seemed to take the spotlight last year, it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate the downfall of dividend stocks, which have long held their allure. As we progress through 2024, the stock and bond market outlook fluctuates regularly, influenced by economic updates, statements from the Federal Reserve, and shifts in interest rate expectations. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, with expectations of the first cut in March. However, following a series of positive economic indicators, the Fed has hinted that a rate cut in March is improbable. Consequently, investors are adjusting their valuations of stocks and bonds, awaiting fewer rate cuts to commence later than previously projected. During uncertain times, it's recommended for investors to focus on dividend stocks. These stocks typically offer good value and can provide consistent income, especially in sectors where there's potential for growth in stock prices.\n\nAnalysts' preference for dividend stocks isn't a recent trend; it's largely based on the historical performance of these stocks. Companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time have proven to be reliable investments, delivering strong returns in the past. These stocks have been particularly resilient during periods of high inflation. For instance, the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index, which tracks companies in the S&P 500 known for consistent or increasing dividends and high forecast dividend yield growth, saw its dividends grow at an annual rate of 13.8% from 2010 to 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This growth rate has surpassed the long-term U.S. inflation rate, even amidst recent spikes in inflation over the past few years. The report also noted that historical data comparing the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Growth Index to the S&P 500 indicated that the index has displayed somewhat defensive traits, with a downside capture ratio of 94.5%. Additionally, over time, the index has typically captured 96% of the market's returns during upward market trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs previously mentioned, dividend stocks took a backseat during the tech surge in 2023, but reliable dividend-paying companies are poised for a strong resurgence. Analysts express optimism that investors will acknowledge the strength of these stocks this year. According to strategists at Lord Abbett, a subset of stocks they view as high quality is dividend-growth stocks\u2014companies with a track record of consistently raising their dividends over time. With the economic cycle showing signs of slowing down, they believe companies with solid balance sheets, robust cash flows, and dependable dividends will be well-prepared to maintain their performance.\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks with decades-long dividend growth streaks under their belt. In this article, we will further take a look at some quality dividend stocks. 12 Best Quality Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nDaily newspaper economy stock market chart\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q3 2023 and identified blue-chip dividend companies with strong balance sheets.

        "content": "IBM (IBM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned +12.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.8% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 13.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 points to a change of +4.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.57 indicates a change of +5.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.1%. The $63.63 billion and $66.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.9% and +4.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $17.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $3.87 for the same period compares with $3.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.59%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget IonQ: 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Quantum computing has captured the imagination of investors and tech enthusiasts alike, promising to revolutionize everything from drug discovery to cryptography. The intense spotlight has made a market darling out of IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), a pure-play quantum computing company. Even after a 45% price drop from its yearly highs last summer, the stock has more than doubled over the last year and trades at a mind-blowing 113 times sales.\n\nIonQ may have a stellar long-term future ahead, but it's still a highly speculative investment. It runs a deeply unprofitable business model with more question marks than exclamation points, and the company has yet to ship a functioning system. The nascent industry looks risky in this early stage, and IonQ doesn't have a Plan B ready in case its research or system-building efforts go wrong. Therefore, I'd rather look at more stable alternatives in the field of quantum computing.\n\nOn that note, here are three companies dabbling in quantum computing as a side gig to far more robust core businesses. This way, you can gain exposure to this cutting-edge technology while also enjoying the benefits of a diversified and proven business platform.\n\n1. Intel\n\nLet's start with semiconductor giant Intel(NASDAQ: INTC). Many investors see quantum computing as a serious threat to old-school digital computers, but Chipzilla is facing the challenge head-on. The company has been researching quantum computing since 2015 and shipped its Tunnel Falls quantum system with 12 qubits (quantum computing units) to research partners last year.\n\nBroader business model: Intel, a leading semiconductor company, is expanding into quantum computing through its research and development initiatives. Its quantum efforts are backed by its foundational semiconductor business, providing financial stability and extensive R&D resources. The company actually tweaked a manufacturing line for standard semiconductors to crank out the Tunnel Falls system. If Intel can scale this approach up to a commercial mass-market volume, those chip-building facilities may become a game-changing competitive advantage. Financial health: Intel is building a lot of manufacturing infrastructure right now, so its balance sheet has seen better days. Still, IonQ can't hold a candle to Intel's $11.5 billion of annual operating cash flows and $7 billion in cash reserves. Cash from the client computing, data center, and internet of things solutions are financing its forays into quantum computing. Industry position: This company essentially built the semiconductor industry from scratch, and it remains a leading competitor nearly six decades later. With its dominant position in the sector, Intel's exploration of quantum computing benefits from its unmatched manufacturing capabilities and global research partnerships.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. International Business Machines\n\nThat's not the only household name on my list of IonQ alternatives today. Did you know that International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) has been working on quantum systems for several years, too? Launched into the quantum realm in 2016 through its cloud computing platform, IBM has been at the forefront of making quantum computing accessible to researchers, developers, and organizations worldwide. Its quantum exploration has already produced a single system with 1,121 qubits and a groundbreaking way to \"knit\" smaller quantum modules together into larger systems with exponentially higher processing capacity. Big Blue isn't shipping its quantum tools to customers or research partners yet, but provides cloud-based access to its most advanced on-site systems.\n\nBroader business model: IBM's transition to a hybrid cloud and AI company was long and uncomfortable -- even painful at times -- but the reformed business model now provides robust revenue growth. Most investors will keep their eyes on IBM's AI prospects over the next few years, while its quantum computing effort pursues its innovative goals in a quiet supporting role. Financial health: With a robust $14 billion in cash from operations and $13.1 billion in cash and equivalents in 2023, IBM's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic investments. This financial stability is crucial as it underpins the company's ambitious R&D initiatives, including its quantum computing adventures. Industry position: Formerly known as a one-stop shop for business-class computing needs, IBM has rewritten its playbook with a sharp focus on high-growth projects like the Red Hat operating system, hybrid cloud services, and AI tools. The company has been around for more than a hundred years and looks poised to compete in the ever-changing IT sector for another century.\n\n3. Honeywell\n\nIt's kind of silly to call Honeywell International(NASDAQ: HON) the least familiar name under the microscope today, but there you go.\n\nThe engineering giant has been into the quantum computing game since 2014, long enough to spin off its quantum team in a Cambridge University partnership called Quantinuum three years ago. Honeywell still controls that stand-alone company with a 54% ownership stake, though Quantinuum is going through the rounds of venture capital funding, perhaps preparing to enter the stock market someday. But so far, Quantinuum effectively remains a subsidiary of Honeywell.\n\nBroader business model: Honeywell is primarily known for its industrial and aerospace products. The air conditioning thermostat in my kitchen has a Honeywell logo on it, probably alongside a thousand building components I'll never see. The company is a giant of several industries, sharing the common theme of advanced technology. Financial health: Honeywell's diverse industrial presence provides a strong financial foundation, enabling sustained investment in quantum computing technologies. Its cash from operations added up to $5.3 billion last year and Honeywell has $7.9 billion of cash equivalents in the bank. Industry position: As an industrial conglomerate, Honeywell brings a unique perspective to quantum computing, focusing on practical applications in materials science and optimization problems -- as any self-respecting engineer would. Quantinuum's official mission is to \"accelerate quantum computing and use its power to positively transform the world.\" I had no idea these companies were into quantum computing! Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThree titans of technology\n\nIonQ offers an exciting opportunity to invest directly in quantum computing's potential. However, Intel, IBM, and Honeywell present more balanced options with far lower business risks. None of these industry giants are going away anytime soon, and I'm not sure you can say the same about IonQ. This hungry upstart must contend with rival solutions from several business legends with far deeper pockets. That's not an easy task.\n\nAll three of my IonQ alternatives are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) market index. I didn't set out to find Dow members with quantum computing ambitions, but that's where I landed anyway. These companies not only participate in the development of quantum computing but also boast diversified business models that mitigate the quantum industry's high risks.\n\nFor investors looking to tap into the quantum computing revolution while managing their risk, these three stocks represent a more prudent choice. I didn't buy Intel and IBM shares to gain exposure to quantum computing. Still, I'll gladly accept whatever research progress and future business success they may find in this side gig. And grabbing one or more of these titans looks like the safest way to invest in the quantum computing sector today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Apple's iconic Super Bowl ad still resonates 4 decades later",
        "content": "Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads.\n\nThat all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS \u2014 and hadn\u2019t fled to the kitchen for snacks \u2014 may have been intrigued by something completely different.\n\nIn between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, \u201cBig Brother,\u201d addressed them on a massive screen.\n\nExtolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated an imminent victory, free from \u201cpests of any contradictory true thoughts.\u201d\n\nThen, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.\n\nWearing a white tank top and red athletic shorts \u2014 and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) \u2014 she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother\u2019s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, \u201cOn January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like '1984.'\u201d\n\nHappy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.\n\nCreated by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), \u201c1984\u201d elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.\n\nThough Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. \u201cIt marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he added, \u201cthe first time where the audience went, \u2018Wait, wait, wait, don't go to the bathroom. Let's stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.'\"\n\nBut Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.\n\nIBM = Big Brother?\n\nIn the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,named after Steve Jobs\u2019 daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM\u2019s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.\n\n\u201cApple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit \u2026 the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,\u201d said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington.\n\nBut then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to \u201cstop the world in its tracks\u201d and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job. John Sculley, left, and Steve Jobs at the Apple Computers shareholders meeting at Flint Center in Cupertino, Calif. on Jan. 24, 1984, to introduce the company's new Macintosh personal computer. (Cap Carpenter/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlong with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline \"Why 1984 won't be like '1984,'\" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 \u201clike the Jetsons.\u201d But the ad\u2019s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.\n\n\u201cHe came and looked at our initial board \u2026 he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,\u201d Hayden explained. \u201cAnd so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.\u201d\n\nThe advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and \"break the spell,\" Hayden said.\n\nA new age\n\nThe heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O\u2019Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. \u201cI think it's telling that she's dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she's running for the United States,\" she said. Those who tuned into the big game saw arguably the greatest Super Bowl ad of all time: Washington vs. Los Angeles, Jan. 22, 1984, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Fla. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images) (Focus On Sport via Getty Images)\n\nThe heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts \u2014 think mainframes and IBM \u2014the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.\n\n\u201cShe was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,\u201d Hayden said.\n\nAdded Chiat/Day\u2019s Schwartz: \u201cYou have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business \u2026 When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us \u2026 and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.\u201d\n\nBut there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. \u201cI had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn't match the traditional advertising forms.\u201d\n\nBut Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recallsthe first time he saw the ad at a 1983meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. \u201cWe had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],\u201d he told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo we could hear what became the highly recognizable \u201cbong\u201d of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.\u201d\n\nThough Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended \u201cBig Brother\u201d to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a \u201cfiery\u201d anti-IBM speech, \u201csaying that the Macintosh would change the world,\u201d according to Gass\u00e9e. \u201cIt was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.\u201d Insisted on a new character: director Ridley Scott. (Mario Anzuoni/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHolding up\n\nIt is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.\n\nAt least Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and X. It serves as \u201ca good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.\u201d he said. \u201cSo this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.\u201d\n\nEnjoy the Super Bowl.\n\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in February",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have overperformed the market since late 2022. As the technology is likely to change the life of the average consumer dramatically, investors have flocked to the stocks that seem to lead the charge, resulting in elevated valuations for many AI stocks.\n\nNonetheless, the spotlight hasn't been equal. Knowing that, investors might want to consider these three stocks before the market becomes more aware of their AI prowess.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nThe emergence of ChatGPT seemed to cast doubt on AI stock Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). This attitude might baffle investors, as the Google parent was an early AI innovator, and it has marketed itself as an \"AI-first\" company for the last eight years.\n\nStill, the sentiment seemed to shift from Alphabet amid the emergence of ChatGPT, whose parent, OpenAI, has a working relationship with Microsoft. That led to fears that consumers would stop using Google Search in favor of Microsoft's search engine, Bing.\n\nHowever, Alphabet bears may have overreacted. First, Alphabet has answered with its own generative AI product, called Gemini. That should at least keep it competitive with its AI peers.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet claims approximately $111 billion in liquidity. Hence, Google DeepMind or other Alphabet-owned enterprises will probably develop tools that match or surpass competitors. Also, if its in-house development falls short, that cash allows Alphabet to buy out smaller competitors.\n\nFinally, its P/E ratio of 25 is the smallest of its primary megatech peers. As it continues to benefit from AI, its stock should overcome the doubters and rise over time.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nInvestors have bid Nvidia stock higher as it asserts a dominant position in the AI chip market. Nonetheless, investors often forget that it and competitors like Advanced Micro Devices depend on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) to manufacture their advanced chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has suffered amid a slump in the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry. Some investors also find the company risky, with most of its production capacity located in Taiwan, an island in the middle of a geopolitical conflict between two superpowers.\n\nHowever, for investors who can overlook those risks, analysts forecast a 23% revenue increase for 2024 and a 20% surge next year. Moreover, they can buy TSM stock at a recent P/E ratio of about 25.\n\nAlso, the stock may finally have begun to gain traction, as it has risen by 25% over the last year. Hence, it may not be an inexpensive stock for long as more investors look for affordable investment options for the AI chip market.\n\n3. IBM\n\nAfter years of stagnation, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) is finally making a comeback, and part of that story is AI. The company's purchase of Red Hat and dozens of other cloud companies made it a leading company in the cloud space, giving it a significant support role in AI.\n\nNonetheless, IBM has also developed AI-specific services. Leading the way is its watsonx generative AI. It serves as a studio to build foundation models, create data estates, and oversee AI projects.\n\nThis optimism has taken IBM stock to levels it last reached in the mid-2010s. Despite those gains, its P/E ratio has only risen to about 23. IBM Chart\n\nAdmittedly, its P/E ratio may be lower because IBM's mid-single-digit revenue growth is not as fast as its megatech competitors. However, in the eyes of some investors, a rising payout with a dividend yield of 3.6% makes IBM the dividend stock of the cloud.\n\nAlso, since Arvind Krishna became CEO in 2020, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500. Given those returns, you might want to start buying shares before more investors begin to take notice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most advanced countries in computer technology. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Computer Technology.\n\nAccording to an IBIS World report, by the end of 2024, 94.6% of households in the US will have at least one computer in their homes. With the growing importance of computer technology, household computer ownership has been growing simultaneously \u2014 rightfully so.\n\nComputer technology allows for tasks to be automated, excessive extensive data to be processed within a few seconds, and for the entire world to remain connected despite the distance. Although it has become as common as fresh air itself, computing technology has helped mankind greatly. A 21st-century individual can perform tasks that their ancestors wouldn\u2019t even dare to think about or what they deemed to be too time-consuming \u2014 for instance, online shopping, data organization, banking, communication, and so much more.\n\nAlongside day-to-day lives, computer technology has transformed every other aspect of the world too, including key industries like finance, education, and healthcare. With computer technology, financial analysts can analyze enormous data and market trends more accurately and make better-informed decisions. Students can access various study materials from anywhere in the world with the help of their computers. Healthcare providers can diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently. The list goes on and on. If you look around, you will find every industry infiltrated deeply by computer technology. Mostly, it\u2019s because computer technology primarily allows for more efficient working and solving complex problems in no time.\n\nLike with anything, the computer technology we are familiar with today has gone through many, many periods of innovation and advancements. The history goes all the way back to 1801 when Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched wooden cards to weave fabric designs. Years later, in 1821, Charles Babbage started working on the Difference Engine, funded by the British Government and unfortunately failed. Fast forward to the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith designed a punch-card system to help the government calculate the 1890 U.S. Census. According to Columbia University, the machine also saved approximately $5 million for the US taxpayer and several years of calculation for the government. Later in the early 20th century, Herman Hollerith established a merger company with Charles Ranlett Flint, a financier and businessman, and the company is now known as the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM).\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) developed its first ever personal computer, \u201cAcorn,\u201d in 1981 and released it into the market for $1,565. Acorn used the MS-DOS operating system from Windows and had optional features, including a display, printer, two diskette drives, extra memory, a game adapter, and more. IBM was not the only company in the race to bring revolution in computer technology. In fact, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) developed the first ever microprocessor chip named \u201cIntel 4004\u201d in November 1971. A microprocessor, also known as a semiconductor chip, is one of the most important components in a computer. Now, after 53 years, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) has become one of the leading manufacturers of semiconductor chips.\n\nIntel\u2019s competitor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), also started in the late 80s and is now the world\u2019s largest semiconductor producer. Morris Chang, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), was supported by the Taiwan government and many private investors to start the company. Soon after, in 1993, the company established its first-ever 8-inch wafer fabrication facility. After years of development and evolution of computer technology, it now stands face-to-face with even more advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Hybrid Clouds, and the Internet of Things.\n\nWith the rise of these technologies, one might think the end of computing technology is near. However, it only seems to be going up. Since semiconductors lay the foundation of the electric components used in Computing technology and nanotechnology helps with the miniaturization process of those components, innovations in both these fields translate to advancement in computing technology. Computing tech giants are now looking into specialized chips and faster algorithms to help meet the ever-increasing needs of the market and the field.\n\nRight now, the next big thing in the industry is the 2-nanometer fabrication process, which aims to achieve a 45% higher performance and consume 75% less energy than a regular 7nm chip. In 2021, the International Business Machines Corporation\u00a0 (NYSE: IBM) produced the world\u2019s first 2nm chip. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) has already started pre-production on the 2nm chip and aims to begin mass production by 2025, whereas Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) aims to begin production this year as well.\n\nFurthermore, traditional computing is also branching off to quantum computing, which is not limited to binary states like making billions of on/off or 0/1 calculations by turning its transistors on or off. Therefore, it delivers an unmatched performance. Between 2024 and 2028, the computer technology field is expected to grow at an impressive 2.62% CAGR while bringing in a revenue of US$314.2bn in 2024 alone.\n\nSome key players in all four of these computing markets are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG), Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI), and D-Wave Systems Inc. (NYSE: QBTS). 13 Most Advanced Countries in Computer Technology\n\n13 Most Advanced Countries in Computer Technology\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used data from the OECD patent database to sift out the top computing technology countries in the world and ranked them on the basis of number of patents between 2000-2020 in computer technology. The patents\u00a0 are under the WIPO's Computing Technology filing category.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "US chipmakers don't have enough workers. Biden hopes a new $5 billion plan will help.",
        "content": "Chipmakers are struggling to get enough Americans trained for the positions needed to keep pace with growing demand. The Biden administration on Friday announced its latest effort to help alleviate the problem.\n\nThe White House said Friday that the US expects to invest more than $5 billion in a public-private consortium aimed at supporting research and development in advanced computer chips.\n\nA key part of the mission of this National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) would be to stand up a \"Workforce Center of Excellence\" funded with hundreds of millions of those dollars. The center plans to set up shop in different regions of the US to try and spur the training of more semiconductor engineers.\n\n\"I cannot overestimate how important this is,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said of the workforce efforts on a call with reporters this week. \"Every semiconductor company we talk to says their success will rely upon having enough highly trained, qualified people to work in the industry,\" she added.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the new effort will be enough to make a dent in labor market concerns that have emerged as a significant roadblock in the effort to bring more chip-making to the US, not to mention President Biden\u2019s re-election efforts. President Joe Biden holds a semiconductor during an event at the White House in 2021 in Washington, DC. (Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images) (Pool via Getty Images)\n\nUntil this week's announcement, much of the responsibility for training workers fell to state and local governments as well the companies themselves. But observers had repeatedly warned those efforts wouldn\u2019t be enough, with more dramatic policy solutions likely becoming inevitable.\n\nAnd with efforts to alleviate the problem via immigration likely foreclosed by the political climate in Washington, the focus has turned toward training new workers.\n\nArizona is set to be a hotbed of the growing US chip sector but has already seen labor issues impinge on those plans. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is at work on a flagship fabrication plant in northern Phoenix but recently announced a delay in the plant's full-scale launch from 2024 to 2025. It cited worker shortages as a reason for the delay.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) is also reportedly slowing the construction timetable on its $20 billion plant in Ohio, but that delay has primarily been caused by a slowing chip market as well as issues with the rollout of government grant money, according to the Wall Street Journal. President Joe Biden toured the under-constructon TSMC Semiconductor Manufacturing Facility in Phoenix in December 2022. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nA need to 'scale up'\n\nThe White House's workforce plan, per a fact sheet released by the administration, is to launch new programs but also leverage the existing local efforts to \"scale up proven education and training programs.\"\n\nA senior administration official added this week that the workforce efforts would be focused on both supporting the manufacturing capacity as well as the emerging research and development efforts.\n\nThe overall goal of the Biden administration\u2019s effort is to reverse a downward spiral for the industry in the US in recent decades. American semiconductor manufacturing\u2019s share of the global market has fallen from nearly 40% in 1990 to less than 10% today, according to the White House.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, 100% of which are currently manufactured overseas. The plants under construction in the US are designed to change that but the workforce issues could only grow in the years ahead.\n\n\"It's just become a huge issue...and it's just not clear where these workers are coming from,\" noted Greg Wright, a professor of economics at the University of California Merced, in an interview last week.\n\n\"If we can't even get the workforce straightened out, I don't know what's going to happen,\" he added.\n\nPresident Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022, and it has been the subject of intense lobbying in the 17 months since. Semiconductor giants like Intel, Micron (MU), IBM (IBM) and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have all been vying for a piece of the money.\n\nIn total, the bill sets aside about $50 billion for grants to the semiconductor sector. That is divided between $39 billion earmarked for manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip research and design purposes.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement was focused on that latter pot of money, with the NSTC being described as the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s R&D efforts.\n\nStill to come are the highly-anticipated direct grants to companies. Most of that money has not yet been allocated but administration officials promise more details within the next two months.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Everyone wants a strong economy, we want as many people to work. Alternate certifications -- digital credentials, short-term programs -- exist that didn't before, and we need to take advantage of those.\"\n\nIBM and many other employers recognize that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. A college degree is one in a growing mix of credentials that signify workforce readiness and competency. IBM provides free education opportunities through IBM SkillsBuild, helping learners develop valuable new skills and access career opportunities. IBM SkillsBuild offers over 1,000 courses in 20 languages on AI, sustainability, cybersecurity, data analysis, cloud computing, and many other technical disciplines - as well as workplace skills such as design thinking.

        "content": "Without a doubt, large-cap stocks have been performing much better than small-cap stocks since the beginning of this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is made up of all large-cap stocks, has climbed 2.5% so far this year, while the S&P 500, whose performance is primarily driven by several strong buy large-cap stocks, is up 4.6% in 2024. Conversely, the Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap stocks is down 4% so far in 2024.\n\nGiven this data, it seems as though investors\u2019 phobia of small-cap companies that are not yet profitable, which took a highly justified hiatus late last year, has returned. Consequently, momentum traders and momentum investors should look to buy large-cap, highly profitable stocks whose issuers have strong balance sheets. Here are three strong buy large-cap stocks for them to consider.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nDriven by strong demand for its AI software and services, as well as its hybrid cloud offerings, IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported impressive fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpecifically, its income from continuing operations climbed 14.5% year-over-year to $3.285 billion. Moreover, Big Blue\u2019s free cash flow surged 1.7% year-over-year to $6.09 billion. Finally, the firm provided 2024 free cash flow guidance of $12 billion, well above Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) estimate of $11 billion to $11.5 billion.\n\nIBM\u2019s AI business is growing rapidly, as its bookings related to the technology soared 100% in Q4 versus Q3. With many companies quickly integrating AI and turning to IBM for help with doing so, the phenomenon should continue to provide a major positive catalyst for the firm\u2019s profitability and for IBM stock going forward. This raid growth makes IBM one of the market\u2019s strong buy large-cap stocks.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) develops computer chips for many different products, and it\u2019s also a leader in the Wi-Fi and server storage sectors. Like IBM, AVGO has been a major beneficiary of the AI Revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently began coverage of AVGO stock with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating, based on the strength of its AI chips business. Specifically, the bank expects the firm to benefit from strong demand for its chips used by datacenters which are both creating AI and facilitating much of its utilization at this point.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom\u2019s partnerships with both Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) should also boost its top and bottom lines in the medium-term and the long-term.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that AVGO has acquired Vmware, which should benefit from its alliance with the largest AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Additionally, VMware has made Broadcom less dependent on its four largest customers, decreasing the risk that it faces.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) stock surged on Jan. 30 after the automaker delivered fourth-quarter results that came in significantly above analysts\u2019 average estimates. While the shares have largely tread water since then, they do appear to have formed a bullish reverse head-and-shoulder pattern this month.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as we get closer to the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, I believe that the shares are likely too pop. That\u2019s because lower rates makes buying vehicles much cheaper for the vast majority of purchasers who take out loans on them.\n\nAnother factor that could boost GM this year is the rapid winding down of the work-from-home phenomenon. As many more Americans resume commuting five days per week, the demand for GM\u2019s vehicles should surge.\n\nBank of America has a $75 price target on the shares, far above their current level of around $39.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- United Parcel Service Inc.\u2019s largest layoffs in its 116-year history were made possible, in part, by new technologies including artificial intelligence, CEO Carole Tom\u00e9 said last week. Citing one example, she said that machine learning allows salespeople to put together proposals without having to ask pricing experts for guidance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on China Ukraine\u2019s Army Chief Leaves After Rift With Zelenskiy Epstein Contacted Staley for Years at Barclays Using Go-Between, Court Filings Claim Citadel Among Hedge Funds That Got Morgan Stanley\u2019s Block-Trading Leaks Xi\u2019s Markets Shakeup Surprised Insiders, Showing Alarm Over Rout\n\nUPS is among a growing number of companies facing an AI two-step of sorts: Showing investors how AI helps do more with less while simultaneously avoiding the fear-mongering that comes with directly linking technology with job cuts. A UPS spokesperson later said AI is not replacing workers, and that executives did not make an explicit connection between AI and the permanent layoffs on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nBlackRock Inc. last month said it would dismiss about 600 employees. In a memo to staff, CEO Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito pointed to dramatic industry shifts \u201cand perhaps most profound, new technologies are poised to transform our industry \u2014 and every other industry.\u201d While Fink has been outspoken about his belief in AI\u2019s potential to turbocharge productivity, the new tech was not cited as a reason for the cuts. The asset manager still expects to have a larger staff by the end of the year as it expands certain parts of the business, according to the memo.\n\nExperts struggle to get an accurate picture of just how many jobs are being eliminated as AI rapidly advances. Since last May, US companies have announced more than 4,600 jobs cuts in order to free up resources to hire people with AI experience or because the technology replaced tasks, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. But that estimate is \u201ccertainly undercounting\u201d the true total, Senior Vice President Andrew Challenger said in an interview.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere are probably more jobs in the economy that are being cut because of AI already than are getting attributed to that or announced. Every time a company mentions it, they get headlines across every news outlet for like a month,\u201d Challenger said. \u201cThey would rather go under the radar most of the time.\u201d\n\nLast spring, International Business Machines Corp. drove headlines across the world when Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg the company planned to pause hiring it thinks it could soon replace with AI. An IBM spokesperson said the company does not have a hiring freeze in place and plans to keep headcount level this year.\n\nJohnny Taylor, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, agreed that many of these kinds of cuts will happen quietly.\n\n\u201cIBM was a leader and was public about it, and got beaten up pretty bad,\u201d Taylor said in an interview in December. \u201cSo the rest of them have said \u2018We\u2019re not going to announce it, I\u2019m just going to do it.\u2019 We\u2019re going to reduce our headcount.\u201d\n\nMany firms may do that by significantly slowing hiring, he said. \u201cWe will wake up three years from now and see much leaner organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have replaced you without making a big announcement.\u201d\n\nSo far, most AI-related cuts have been in the tech industry, according to Challenger\u2019s tally. Some companies, like homework help site Chegg and programmer help site Stack Overflow, cut staff after their businesses were directly undercut by AI products. Other companies, like file-storage service Dropbox, raced to refocus on the new technology, letting go of staff to make way for new hires with AI skill sets.\n\nAfter IBM, only a handful of companies have explicitly tied AI to job cuts or hiring freezes.\n\nIn December, the Swedish buy now, pay later firm Klarna Inc. said it would freeze hiring as tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT cut down the time certain tasks take. \u201cWe need fewer people to do the same thing,\u201d CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the Telegraph. \u201cThe right thing for us is just to say: \u2018let\u2019s not recruit now, let\u2019s see how this plays out.\u2019\u201d A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment further.\n\nIn January, language-learning software company Duolingo Inc. chose not to renew about 10% of its contractors.\n\n\u201cWe just no longer need as many people to do the type of work some of these contractors were doing. Part of that could be attributed to AI,\u201d a spokesperson told Bloomberg, adding that Duolingo does not have a hiring freeze in place and is actively recruiting for a wide range of roles. The company said no full-time employees were affected and that the job reduction isn\u2019t a \u201cstraight replacement\u201d of workers with AI, as many of its full-time employees and contractors use the technology in their work.\n\nThese companies aren\u2019t alone in their thinking, even if others don\u2019t say it out loud: Three out of four Fortune 500 chief human resources officers surveyed by Gallup last year said they see AI replacing jobs in their company in the next three years.\n\nIn the tech industry, some top executives have warned AI could eliminate certain jobs, with Elon Musk going so far as to say, \u201cThere will come a point where no job is needed.\u201d But for the companies currently introducing AI to workers, there's often a more positive spin.\n\n\u201cThe big thing you\u2019ll hear companies say is they\u2019re not focused on elimination, but augmentation \u2014 trying to make people more effective and efficient,\u201d Challenger said. \u201cBut clearly there are a lot of scenarios right now where one person could do the work of four or five people with the help of AI in a way they couldn\u2019t a year ago. That\u2019s playing out on the ground even if we\u2019re not hearing about it in big announcements from organizations.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jack Dorsey\u2019s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went South OpenAI's Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman's 33-Year-Old Lieutenant Inside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About Layoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren\u2019t Sacred Anymore\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday said leading artificial intelligence companies are among more than 200 entities joining a new U.S. consortium to support the safe development and deployment of generative AI. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC), which includes OpenAI, Alphabet's Google, Anthropic and Microsoft along with Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon.com, Nvidia Palantir, Intel, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.\n\n\"The U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence,\" Raimondo said in a statement.\n\nThe consortium, which also includes BP, Cisco Systems, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Northop Grumman, Mastercard, Qualcomm, Visa and major academic institutions and government agencies, will be housed under the U.S. AI Safety Institute (USAISI).\n\nThe group is tasked with working on priority actions outlined in President Biden\u2019s October AI executive order \"including developing guidelines for red-teaming, capability evaluations, risk management, safety and security, and watermarking synthetic content.\"\n\nMajor AI companies last year pledged to watermark AI-generated content to make the technology safer. Red-teaming has been used for years in cybersecurity to identify new risks, with the term referring to U.S. Cold War simulations where the enemy was termed the \"red team.\"\n\nBiden's order directed agencies to set standards for that testing and to address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn December, the Commerce Department said it was taking the first step toward writing key standards and guidance for the safe deployment and testing of AI.\n\nThe consortium represents the largest collection of test and evaluation teams and will focus on creating foundations for a \"new measurement science in AI safety,\" Commerce said.\n\nGenerative AI - which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts - has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower humans and catastrophic effects.\n\nWhile the Biden administration is pursuing safeguards, efforts in Congress to pass legislation addressing AI have stalled despite numerous high-level forums and legislative proposals.

        "content": "So far, to the best of my knowledge, only three prominent stocks have surged tremendously as a direct result of the AI Revolution: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2014 of course. Microsoft is incorporating AI into its software and sells AI tools to many firms through its cloud infrastructure unit, Azure. Super Micro markets hardware used to develop and provide AI, while Nvidia sells the chips used to create the technology. But many firms will need help implementing AI since they haven\u2019t done so before. As a result, they need to hire other companies to assist them with this endeavor, enabling these firms to ultimately generate a great deal of revenue and profits from these projects. Indeed, according to one report, \u201cthe\u00a0Global AI Consulting Services market is to witness a CAGR\u00a0of 38.5%\u201d between 2024 and 2030. I believe the stock market will begin rewarding these names soon, making them great AI stocks for the next bull run.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nAccenture (NYSE:ACN)clearly sees a huge, long-term opportunity for itself in AI, as it intends to hire 40,000 more \u201cdata and AI experts\u201d \u201cin coming years.\u201d That would bring its total staff in those areas to 80,000.\n\nMoreover, ACN Chief Executive, Technology and CTO Paul Daugherty stated that many businesses are having trouble determining \u201chow and where\u201d to utilize AI. That assertion suggests the company, as well as its competitors, can indeed generate huge amounts of revenue and profits from helping businesses implement AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso noteworthy is that on Jan. 24, investment bank Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) identified Accenture as one name within the \u201csmall- and mid-cap\u201d stock group gaining momentum. The bank stated that ACN had \u201csurpassed multiple resistance levels,\u201d and shares were likely to climb going forward.\n\nAlso importantly, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) on Dec. 19 stated it would expand its collaboration with ACN to focus on AI. The announcement bodes well for ACN\u2019s ability to convince many of its large customers to similarly expand their partnerships with Accenture.\n\nStory continues\n\nEPAM Systems (EPAM) The logo for Epam Systems is seen on the side of an office building.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nEPAMSystems (NYSE:EPAM) provides \u201cdigital transformation services.\u201d In August 2023, the firm started a team to help businesses \u201cstreamline and enhance (their) AI-driven business solutions.\u201d\n\nAlso noteworthy is, in December, EPAM unveiled an open-source platform that will enable developers to create new AI applications. I believe the initiative is a low-cost way for EPAM to create new, innovative and highly useful AI apps that can market and sell to its customer base. Consequently, I think this initiative will prove to be very profitable for EPAM over the longer term.\n\nOn Nov. 3, investment bank Piper Sandler raised its rating on EPAM stock to Overweight from Neutral. The bank stated it became more bullish on the company\u2019s fundamentals and long-term outlook in the wake of its Q3 results. It raised its price target on the shares to $265 from $243.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) provided higher-than-expected 2024 top-line growth guidance of about 5%, excluding currency fluctuations. That was above analysts\u2019 average estimate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tech giant expects to generate an impressive free cash flow of about $12 billion this year.\n\nIBM reported that the deployment of AI systems by many of its customers was meaningfully boosting the overall demand for both its software and services.\n\nNotably, CEO Arvind Krishna stated its AI-related pipeline had doubled in Q4 versus Q3.\n\nCalling IBM\u2019s 2024 free cash flow guidance of $12 billion \u201cthe standout metric,\u201d Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) noted it had only expected the firm to provide free cash flow guidance of $11 billion to $11.5 billion.\n\nIBM\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio of 18.3 is quite attractive.\n\nIBM\u2019s strong prospects and attractive valuation make it one of the great AI stocks for the next bull run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With data generation exploding thanks to AI, IoT, and other innovative technologies, tech\u2019s brightest stars have lit up Wall Street in recent months. But the biggest gains may still be ahead for this group, as this data explosion kicks into overdrive. That\u2019s why I think savvy investors should start positioning their portfolios to profit from surging data demand now.\n\nThe best way to play this trend is to own the top companies enabling and harnessing all this data. I\u2019m talking about the leading cloud computing and storage providers powering today\u2019s data-hungry AI systems and internet-connected devices. As the need for speed and storage capacity increases, these cutting-edge innovators stand to grow even faster.\n\nOf course, with tech valuations stretched and competition remaining fierce, risks abound. We could see speed bumps along the way. But the long-term trajectory for AI and IoT data usage remains overwhelmingly positive. Wall Street is slapping massive premiums on these stocks for a reason.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its iron grip on cloud computing, it\u2019s no wonder Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at a premium valuation. Commanding 31% total market share of the red-hot cloud infrastructure space that drove $73.7 billion in fourth quarter revenue alone, AWS shows no signs of loosening its stranglehold on this space any time soon.\n\nIn fact, AWS grew a solid 13% year-over-year last quarter, hitting analyst targets. As the overall cloud infrastructure market marches toward more than $100 billion in (likely) less than two years, I expect AWS to keep pace or even see its growth rate accelerate. Amazon\u2019s stock should ride higher along with AWS\u2019s success.\n\nNot only does AWS enable Amazon\u2019s dominance in e-commerce, but it also powers many of the hottest tech trends. Expanding traction in areas like AI, machine learning, IoT, and other cloud services provides additional growth runways for the e-commerce giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith all these catalysts aligned, I remain confident in Amazon\u2019s staying power. The company sits at the intersection of several massive secular growth trends that show no sign of slowing. For these reasons, I view AMZN stock as a long-term winner that will keep compounding over time.\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) a programmatic ad is served up on a smartphone\n\nSource: shutterstock.com\n\nAs targeted digital advertising leans more heavily on ever-growing data stockpiles, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) stands ready to cash in big time. While not an outright AI or cloud infrastructure play, The Trade Desk benefits enormously from the accelerating demand for consumer data to power precision ad targeting.\n\nThe Trade Desk\u2019s platform enables advertisers to deliver highly-relevant, personalized, and impactful ads by analyzing user behaviors, demographics, and interests. With data holding the keys to next-level advertising effectiveness, it\u2019s no shocker The Trade Desk boasts steep long-term growth forecasts. Analysts expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to grow at roughly 20% per year for the foreseeable future, with revenue growth rates coming in around the same range.\n\nEven with a valuation that appears stretched at 54-times forward earnings and 17.5-times sales, those rich multiples make sense for this top dog in the data-driven digital ad targeting realm. I believe competitive solid advantages, hard-to-replicate proprietary data and algorithms, and a massive market opportunity support an elevated premium.\n\nSure, there could be some speed bumps or growth deceleration at some point. But overall, I see The Trade Desk winning big as advertisers rely more on data to unlock advertising profits.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeft for dead after years of stagnation, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has since transformed itself into an emerging data and AI giant poised for new glory days ahead. Having shed slower-growth legacy businesses to focus its resources on next-generation technologies, a refreshed IBM looks to be hitting its stride at just the right time.\n\nNotably, IBM stock has surged 35% over the past year compared to 19% gains for the S&P 500 index. The company\u2019s 2024 guidance calls for 4%-5% annual revenue growth alongside $12 billion in free cash flow generation. Indeed, these numbers highlight the new IBM built around high-growth opportunities like hybrid cloud, AI, and security appears to have turned the corner.\n\nPersonally, I believe IBM\u2019s investments in frontier technologies like quantum computing hold even greater long-term promise. IBM continues plowing billions into research and development in this space to pioneer real-world applications that are years ahead of rivals. Thus, with quantum computing poised to revolutionize the word, I think that once viable use cases emerge within this decade, we could see history-making breakthroughs sooner than most expect, boosting IBM stock in the process.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Quantum computing is a scientific field that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than traditional computers. It\u2019s a lesser-known are of technology that is growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nIn fact, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. forecasts that the market for quantum computing could reach $1.3 trillion by 2035. Industries within automotive, chemicals, financial services, and life sciences would be the main beneficiaries of the technological advances. Given the huge, largely untapped market, it should come as no surprise that companies are racing to capitalize on the opportunity. Both small start-ups and the most powerful tech firms worldwide are competing to develop the most advanced quantum computers of today and tomorrow.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the top three quantum computing stocks to buy while they are on the dip this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is a pure-play quantum computer concern. The company is developing a trapped ion quantum computer and also makes quantum circuits for use by third parties.\n\nIonQ is widely viewed as one of the best ways for investors to gain exposure to the quantum computing sector. Evidence lies in the 93% gain in the company\u2019s share price over the last 12 months. However, IONQ stock has pulled back 14% year to date (YTD). Therefore, a prime buying opportunity for investors is present.\n\nThe decrease in IONQ stock can be blamed on the fact that the company remains unprofitable. It reported a net loss of $44.8 million in last year\u2019s Q3. However, sales grew 122% year over year (YOY) to $6.1 million, and its customer bookings now exceed $100 million. Also, rumors circulate that IonQ could become a takeover target as larger tech companies look for ways to capitalize on the emergence of quantum computing.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has its hands in a lot of pots. One of the biggest pots is quantum computing. Last December, IBM unveiled what is being called the world\u2019s most advanced quantum computer at its Thomas J. Watson Research Center.\n\nStory continues\n\nCalled the \u201cThe IBM Quantum System Two,\u201d the computer is capable of solving the most complex mathematical problems. Further, this would be achieved in a fraction of the time that it would take the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\n\nAlso, IBM unveiled a new quantum computing chip in December. Taken together, the Quantum System Two and chip, combined with new code, could lead to IBM producing a series of quantum machines by 2033. Recently, IBM\u2019s Director of Research Dario Gil appear on the TV show 60 Minutes. He believes the IBM\u2019s quantum computers could solve problems in physics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine within minutes. That would take today\u2019s silicon-based supercomputers millions of years to compute.\n\nIBM stock has gained 35% in the last 12 months, including a 14% year-to-date increase.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn addition to being an artificial intelligence (AI) leader, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) leads the pack in quantum computing.\n\nThe company\u2019s scientists and engineers have been responsible for several major breakthroughs in quantum computing over the years. In 2019, the company announced that it had achieved what\u2019s known as \u201cquantum supremacy.\u201d That\u2019s when a quantum computer solves a problem that a traditional computer couldn\u2019t.\n\nIn Alphabet\u2019s case, one of its quantum computers solved a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds. In contrast, today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers would need thousands of years to achieve it. Additionally, Alphabet has successfully demonstrated for the first time that errors in quantum computing could be reduced by increasing the number of qubits used in processing. This overcomes what was previously viewed as a major stumbling block for quantum computers. GOOGL stock has risen 34% in the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "AI chatbots are making cybersecurity work much easier\u2013but foundation models are about to revolutionize it",
        "content": "When generative AI made its debut, businesses entered an AI experiment. They bought in on innovations that many of them don\u2019t quite understand or, perhaps, fully trust. However, for cybersecurity professionals, harnessing the potential of AI has been the vision for years\u2013and a historic milestone will soon be reached: the ability to predict attacks.\n\nThe idea of predicting anything has always been the \u201choly grail\u201d in cybersecurity, and one met, for good reason, with significant skepticism. Any claim about \u201cpredictive capabilities\u201d has turned out to be either marketing hype or a premature aspiration. However, AI is now at an inflection point where access to more data, better-tuned models, and decades of experience have carved a more straightforward path toward achieving prediction at scale.\n\nBy now, you might think I\u2019m a few seconds away from suggesting chatbots will morph into cyber oracles, but no, you can sigh in relief. Generative AI has not reached its peak with next-gen chatbots. They\u2019re only the beginning, blazing a trail for foundation models and their reasoning ability to evaluate with high confidence the likelihood of a cyberattack, and how and when it will occur.\n\nClassical AI models\n\nTo grasp the advantage that foundation models can deliver to security teams in the near term, we must first understand the current state of AI in the field. Classical AI models are trained on specific data sets for specific use cases to drive specific outcomes with speed and precision, the key advantages of AI applications in cybersecurity. And to this day, these innovations, coupled with automation, continue to play a drastic role in managing threats and protecting users\u2019 identity and data privacy.\n\nWith classical AI, if a model was trained on Clop ransomware (a variant that has wreaked havoc on\u00a0hundreds of organizations), it would be able to identify various signatures and subtleties inferring that this ransomware is in your environment and flag it with priority to the security team. And it would do it with exceptional speed and precision that surpasses manual analysis.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the threat model has changed. The attack surface is expanding, adversaries are leaning on AI just as much as enterprises are, and security skills are still scarce. Classical AI cannot cover all bases on its own.\n\nSelf-trained AI models\n\nThe recent boom of generative AI pushed Large Language Models (LLMs) to centerstage in the cybersecurity sector because of their ability to quickly fetch and summarize various forms of information for security analysts using natural language. These models deliver human-like interaction to security teams, making the digestion and analysis of complex, highly technical information significantly more accessible and much quicker.\n\nWe\u2019re starting to see LLMs empower teams to make decisions faster and with greater accuracy. In some instances, actions that previously required weeks are now completed in days\u2013and even hours.\u00a0Again, speed and precision remain the critical characteristics of these recent innovations.\u00a0Salient examples are breakthroughs introduced with\u00a0IBM Watson Assistant, Microsoft Copilot,\u00a0or Crowdstrike\u2019s Charlotte AI chatbots.\n\nIn the security market, this is where innovation is right now: materializing the value of LLMs, mainly through chatbots positioned as artificial assistants to security analysts. We\u2019ll see this innovation convert to adoption and drive material impact over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nConsidering the industry talent shortage and rising volume of threats that security professionals face daily, they need all the helping hands they can get\u2013and chatbots can act as a force multiplier there. Just consider that cybercriminals have been able\u00a0to reduce the time required to execute a ransomware attack by 94%: \u00a0they\u2019re weaponizing time, making it essential for defenders to optimize their own time to the maximum extent possible.\n\nHowever, cyber chatbots are just precursors to the impact that foundation models can have on cybersecurity.\n\nFoundation models at the epicenter of innovation\n\nThe maturation of LLMs will allow us to harness the full potential of foundation models. Foundation models can be trained on multimodal data\u2013not just text but image, audio, video, network data, behavior, and more. They can build on LLMs' simple language processing and significantly augment or supersede the current volume of parameters that AI is bound to. Combined with their self-supervised nature, they become innately intuitive and adaptable.\n\nWhat does this mean? In our previous ransomware example, a foundation model wouldn't need to have ever seen Clop ransomware\u2013or any ransomware for that matter\u2013to pick up on anomalous, suspicious behavior. Foundation models are self-learning. They don't need to be trained for a specific scenario. Therefore, in this case, they'd be able to detect an elusive, never-before-seen threat. This ability will augment security analysts' productivity and accelerate their investigation and response.\n\nThese capabilities are close to materializing. About a year ago, we began running a trial project at IBM, pioneering a foundation model for security to detect previously unseen threats, foresee them, and empower intuitive communication and reasoning across an enterprise's security stack without compromising data privacy.\n\nIn a client trial, the model\u2019s nascent capabilities predicted 55 attacks several days before the attacks even occurred. Of those 55 predictions, the analysts have evidence that 23 of those attempts took place as expected, while many of the other attempts were blocked before they hit the radar. Amongst others, this included multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attempts and phishing attacks intending to deploy different malware strains. Knowing adversaries\u2019 intentions ahead of time and prepping for these attempts gave defenders a time surplus they don\u2019t often.\n\nThe training data for this foundation model comes from several data sources that can interact with each other\u2013from API feeds, intelligence feeds, and indicators of compromise to indicators of behavior and social platforms, etc. The foundation model allowed us to \u201csee\u201d adversaries\u2019 intention to exploit known vulnerabilities in the client environment and their plans to exfiltrate data upon a successful compromise. Additionally, the model hypothesized over 300 new attack patterns, which is information organizations can use to harden their security posture.\n\nThe importance of the time surplus this knowledge gave defenders cannot be overstated. By knowing what specific attacks were coming, our security team could run mitigation actions to stop them from achieving impact (e.g., patching a vulnerability and correcting misconfigurations) and prepare its response for those manifesting into active threats.\n\nWhile it would bring me no greater joy than to say foundation models will stop cyber threats and render the world cyber-secure, that's not necessarily the case. Predictions aren't prophecies\u2013they are substantiated forecasts.\n\nSridhar Muppidi is an IBM fellow and CTO of IBM Security.\n\nMore must-read\u00a0commentary\u00a0published by\u00a0Fortune:\n\nThe markets are starting to realize\u00a0just how hawkish the Fed is\u2013and reckoning with higher-for-longer interest rates The Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0freeze on LNG projects is a gift to Putin WEF president: \u2018It\u2019s time to revitalize trade\u2014and reverse the trend of Slowbalization\u2019 The anti-DEI movement has gone\u00a0from fringe to mainstream.

        "title": "National Apprenticeship Week 2024: Skills For Life",
        "content": "By Jenny Taylor\n\nOriginally published by FE News\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 7, 2024 / \"Skills for Life\" is both an inspirational and very appropriate theme for this year's National Apprenticeship Week. The half-life of skills is shrinking making continuous learning essential. In this article, Jenny explains how apprenticeships can help individuals and organisations fill the growing skills gap.\n\n\"Skills for Life\" is a very inspirational theme for this year's National Apprenticeship Week. \"It all starts with skills\" is the strapline and what an interesting one to choose, as opposed to \"it all starts with qualifications or exam results\". The campaign aims to inspire individuals and businesses to make the most of their potential. This is very much needed, as according to the World Economic Forum, closing the global skills gap could add US$11.5 trillion to global GDP by 2028, and education and training systems need to keep pace with market demands. Companies estimate that 50% of all employees will need reskilling.\n\nAt IBM, this is not a new theme. Continuous skills development is critical in delivering valued service to our clients, and therefore a sustainable learning culture is paramount to IBM's success. Every IBMer commits to enhancing their skills on an ongoing basis. It's also changed our attitude to how we recruit at all levels in the company not just in the UK, but globally too. In today's economy, a career in technology does not always require a traditional bachelor's degree. Skills are the currency of today and tomorrow and the half-life of skills is shrinking; the skills a person has today could be obsolete in a few years which makes continuous learning essential.\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nImage courtesy of FE News\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\r\nSpokesperson: IBM\r\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\r\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM\n\nView the original press release on accesswire.com",

        "content": "The strong economy is spurring more excitement, and you should snap up stocks that could be the next trillion-dollar companies. The positive future of the U.S. government is highlighted by robust economic indicators, such as the creation of 353,000 jobs in January, which exceeded expectations and demonstrated sustained economic momentum. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has seen encouraging reports covering GDP growth, declining inflation, and rising consumer confidence. With unemployment remaining below four percent for nearly two years, the U.S. economy is positioned strongly, contributing to an optimistic outlook for the government\u2019s future. Investing is a must-do. You need to take advantage of the ongoing strong markets and profit from these possible next trillion-dollar companies.\n\nNext Trillion-Dollar Companies: Broadcom Inc (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)is an American developer and manufacturer of semiconductor software and infrastructure. Offering a variety of products, Broadcom has amassed a valuation of $1,243.10, with a YoY valuation growth of 102.11%.\n\nWith a recent surge in semiconductor demand, the overall market is expected to increase. In 2022, the industry grossed\u00a0$573.44 billion in revenue, projected to jump to $1.380 trillion in 2029.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinancially, AVGO displayed strong economic pillars in their October 2023 quarter, growing in every key metric. Starting with revenue, AVGO reported\u00a0$9.29 billion, a YoY growth of 4.09%. Further, net income and diluted EPS saw secure increases, bringing in $3.52 billion and 8.25, respectively, or YoY jumps of 4.91% and 14.74%. A trend of green across the board was reported for Broadcom all through fiscal year 2023, and projections forecast a similar trend for 2024.\n\nLargely, look to Broadcom\u2019s expansion of their VMware software and integration as a focal point in their stock growth. At the start of the year,\u00a0Broadcom announced they would begin to integrate VMware into their capabilities, improving processing, storage, and overall performance of hardware services under their tech. At the same time, Broadcom is emphasizing AI as a full priority for its technologies and growing AI models. With partnerships with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), we expect Broadcom to see an increase in productivity this year. Thus, it is one of my top picks as a contender for one of the next trillion-dollar companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet Inc (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)\u00a0is a cybersecurity company. It specializes in firewalls, with its FortiGate line being its main product and source of revenue.\n\nFTNT is up\u00a014.38% YTD, indicating healthy growth. Many analysts rate the stock between a \u2018buy\u2019 and \u2018hold.\u2019\n\nFortinet sales growth has been consistently impressive. Growing from\u00a03,342 million USD in 2021 to 4,417 million USD the following year, sales growth in 2022 was 32.17%. The company has demonstrated healthy finances, with net operating cash flow growing by 15.4% in 2022 from the previous year, showcasing its ability to generate cash flow from its daily operations. Fortinet has also been growing its assets, with total assets growing 5.22% in 2022.\n\nFortinet\u2019s key catalyst is its premium-quality yet cost-effective firewalls. The company has made considerable innovations to its product line. For example, it\u00a0announced the industry\u2019s first Wi-Fi 7-enabled secure networking solution. This places Fortinet above its competitors, or as Chief Marketing Officer of the firm John Maddison says, \u201cFortinet is the only vendor converging networking technology and AI-powered security into a single, holistic solution to connect and protect the wired and wireless LAN.\u201d Fortinet is a great choice for investors looking for tech stocks to buy.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)is a financial services firm and is the largest bank in the United States. Its stock has a valuation of $174.73, which is 25.76% more than last year.\n\nJPM thrives in every financial metric, whether profitability, valuation, or growth. This is displayed by its various financial arrays, including its Net Income Margin (TTM) of 33.94%, which is 45.30% more than the sector median. Revenue Growth (YoY) was also lofty at 19.36%, which, compared to the measly 4.47% sector median, is 332.78% bigger. Price / Sales (TTM) is nearly 32.71% more than the median, and Price / Book (FWD) is 45.02% more. These metrics differentiate JPM from its competitors while showing an investor that it will continue growing quickly, making it incredibly valuable and profitable.\n\nJPM purchased and bailed out First Republic Bank on\u00a0May 1, 2023, and that acquisition allowed it to raise interest rates, thus causing its financials to skyrocket. Chase has a respectable reputation, and due to its large display of services ranging from auto loans to mortgages and its broad selection of credit cards, it isn\u2019t a surprise that it is America\u2019s leading financial service. Its reputation will only continue growing along with its branches, which are easily accessible nationwide. Overall, as Chase\u2019s financials, services, and locations grow, its valuation will follow through, and with an increase in sales, it is only a matter of time before it becomes one of the next trillion-dollar companies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Timeless Tech Stocks to Buy and Never Let Go",
        "content": "As we enter February 2024, it\u2019s a good time to reevaluate our portfolios and ensure we\u2019re positioned for long-term growth. Tech stocks have been some of the best performers over the past two decades, with massive shifts towards AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing propelling future gains. While I often cover intriguing under-the-radar names, today I want to discuss seven timeless tech stocks that should form the enduring core of your portfolio.\n\nMany of us get distracted chasing the latest hot tech stock, but making emotional snap decisions often leads us astray. Instead, I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on tech stalwarts with proven track records, dominant market positions, and secular growth trends that will drive revenue growth for years to come. These stocks may lack sky-high glamor but offer resilience and steady gains that outweigh short-term hype. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs we kick off 2024, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of my highest conviction long-term holds. This tech titan has been firing on all cylinders under Satya Nadella\u2019s leadership, which is evidenced by its meteoric rise to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. If you look at Microsoft\u2019s stock chart over the past decade, it paints a picture of outstanding compound growth that I expect to continue flowing in shareholders\u2019 brokerage accounts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft struck gold by funding OpenAI, providing immense leverage over ChatGPT and other coveted AI models set to penetrate the mainstream. Cloud computing has also fueled tremendous growth lately, with no signs of slowing as enterprises rapidly migrate more workloads to Azure. Microsoft also wields additional leverage in nascent quantum computing, aggressive gaming pursuits, and flourishing subscription services. This diversified tech giant consistently makes the right moves to drive revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite steep gains, Microsoft still trades at a reasonable 36.5-times earnings. I think that\u2019s a cheap valuation, relative to its quality and growth prospects. For a dominant firm generating $62 billion in quarterly sales and 18% year-over-year growth, I believe this multiple remains attractive for long-horizon investors. Indeed, MSFT stock deserves a premium valuation given its expanding moat and history of adapting to industry shifts decade after decade.\n\nIn short, Microsoft checks all the boxes: visionary leadership, AI/cloud secular trends, reasonable valuation, fortress balance sheet, and a demonstrated capacity to penetrate new markets. That\u2019s why I urge accumulating MSFT stock hand over fist if you have a 10-20-year investment horizon.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been largely overlooked amid the AI hype cycle, but don\u2019t sleep on this cash cow. Despite recent lackluster stock returns compared to big tech peers, GOOG stock has still rallied 22.5% annually over the past decade. Google\u2019s Bard debacle also overshadowed that YouTube monetization is hitting its long-awaited stride.\n\nAfter decades of patience with YouTube\u2019s ad potential, Alphabet is finally squeezing money from its neglected golden goose. Blocking ad blockers and adding more premium features like enhanced bitrate has allowed Google to pull all the right profitability leverage. Notably, these levers are being pulled while Alphabet enjoys unrivaled competitive moats around YouTube and Search. These platforms drive significant profit margins and serve billions of users each month. Sustainable double-digit growth is likely for years to come.\n\nToday, the company\u2019s revenue sits at $307.4 billion, up 10% year over year. With YouTube pitching in $9.2 billion last quarter alone, Google has barely scratched the surface of maximizing this asset. Its latest Gemini AI upgrade also aims to challenge OpenAI\u2019s model in capability. Even if inferior, don\u2019t underestimate Google\u2019s ability to monetize AI with its wealth of data and domains.\n\nFor a dominant firm increasing sales 10%+ annually, GOOG stock\u2019s valuation multiple of 21-times forward earnings seems reasonable, given its history of over-delivering. This is a buy-and-hold-forever stock if I\u2019ve ever seen one.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of underappreciated monetization efforts, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has executed a phenomenal turnaround since the pandemic lows. After subscriber declines and fears it would stay permanently impaired, Netflix made savvy strategic moves that reinvigorated growth and turbocharged its earnings power over the past year.\n\nIt turns out those pandemic pull-forwards masked Netflix\u2019s secular shift toward pricing power. Successfully cracking down on rampant password sharing, hiking subscription fees, and attracting wealthier customers have allowed impressive gains since my bullish call in November 2022. Additionally, Netflix is adding subscribers at a healthy clip, now that the dead weight has fallen off.\n\nWith market-leading originals fueling must-have exclusivity and no viable competitors at scale, I believe Netflix enjoys immense latitude to drive further average revenue per user gains in Western markets. There\u2019s still a long runway left for growth in emerging countries, even if a recession temporarily cools subscription momentum.\n\nI estimate Netflix will expand operating margins back to 25% within a few years from 16% currently, fueling 20%+ annual earnings per share growth for the foreseeable future. The market has turned too bearish here just as Netflix enters its golden age. I suggest buying more on any dips \u2013 this comeback story has plenty of gas left in the tank, both fundamentally and optically, now that positive sentiment has returned.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ve been pounding the table on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook) for two years now, first calling it a \u201cbuy\u201d around $112 in 2022. In October 2023, I projected a move to $400 per share by 2024, driven by ad revenue resilience and metaverse potential. We fell a bit short, since META ended 2023 near $350, but it now trades around $460 per share post-market as of writing.\n\nFour months ago, I\u00a0said,\n\n\u201cMeta does not pay a dividend, unlike many mature tech stocks, and its valuation seems fair based on 2023 estimates. If Meta did return cash to shareholders instead of investing heavily in its metaverse vision, a dividend could make it more appealing for long-term investors.\u201d\n\nJust as I suggested last fall, Meta announced a quarterly 50 cent per share dividend hours ago (as of writing), alongside a $50 billion share buyback authorization. This capital return program demonstrates management\u2019s confidence in continued free cash flow generation even with heavy Reality Labs investment dragging on earnings. The dividend also sets a new tone for Meta as a shareholder-friendly tech giant capable of balancing growth prospects with delivering direct value today.\n\nI\u2019m not going to backpedal now that META stock is trading where it is. That price tag still looks attractive for long-term investors due to the new buyback program and dividend. The company\u2019s core advertising business boasts tremendous staying power thanks to unrivaled user engagement and data advantages. Meanwhile, Metaverse initiatives will bear fruit over the next decade across consumer and enterprise applications.\n\nPatience has already paid off for believers in this dominant social media ecosystem. Now, income and buybacks provide extra incentives alongside an improving growth narrative. I suggest buying more META stock, and holding forever. My October bull case assumed $500 per share by the end of 2025. I think $600 is achievable now.\n\nIs that a stretch? We\u2019ll see.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother veteran tech company making strides lately is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which I flagged a year ago, saying, \u201cIBM will likely grow much faster in the future as it is making a turnaround by shifting its focus to cloud computing, AI, and blockchain.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Big Blue is back after years of sluggishness. Strategic imperatives like hybrid cloud, security, and AI now generate most of IBM\u2019s sales. Quantum hardware remains a key differentiator, too \u2013 IBM recently unveiled its new 433-qubit Osprey processor while competitors are far behind.\n\nUp 37% in one year, IBM seems to be regaining its groove. The company\u2019s cloud, AI/ML, quantum, and blockchain segments indicate an effective pivot toward the most promising future technologies. Renewed revenue growth and expanding margins further cement my confidence. IBM should keep outpacing as enterprises quest to extract value from data across hybrid environments.\n\nTesla (TSLA) A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla (TSLA) store with several vehicles visible behind a glass door\n\nSource: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.com\n\nShifting gears, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has endured a painful stretch along with the broader electric vehicle complex. TSLA stock is down 24% just since 2024 began as spiking rates, inflation, and gloomy macro forecasts create strong headwinds for automakers. Competition is also heating up, with BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) quickly moving up the ranks in terms of global EV sales.\n\nNonetheless, I remain staunchly bullish on Tesla over any investment horizon beyond 12-18 months. At less than $190 per share, as I write this, TSLA stock trades at the cheapest valuation I\u2019ve seen since April 2023.\n\nRates won\u2019t stay high forever. Inflation continues to moderate, as well. Once economic storm clouds clear, Tesla will still provide immense growth potential as the de facto leader of a rapidly-emerging mobility market. China\u2019s production issues should sort themselves out over time, too. This creates a compelling risk/reward setup for patient investors.\n\nI expect TSLA stock to regain $300+ per share within two years as macro drags fade and the company\u2019s vertical integration engine kicks back into high gear. EV penetration still stands very low globally. Thus, Tesla remains the best EV option to capitalize on mainstream adoption.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast and admittedly, the least conviction pick from my end, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world\u2019s most valuable public company (depending on the day) has essentially traded sideways for six months now, absent any compelling growth narrative. iPhone sales still dominate the company\u2019s top line, while tablets, personal computers, and wearables contribute much less individually. Unfortunately, streaming remains a money pit.\n\nRumors suggest the company is cooking up an autonomous electric vehicle behind closed doors. However, I wouldn\u2019t bank on such a product moving the needle soon, even if released eventually. Meanwhile, Apple has largely remained on the AI sidelines, forfeiting major performance potential versus peers aggressively pursuing this vertical.\n\nNonetheless, shares seem reasonably valued at around 30-times earnings. The company\u2019s Services and Accessories segments continue to grow nicely as Apple\u2019s installed base marches higher. While unlikely to rally sharply anytime soon, I don\u2019t see much downside risk to AAPL stock either. Steady dividend increases and buybacks are likely to provide extra support.\n\nFor now, Apple looks stuck in the mud \u2013 an acceptable hold, but not one I\u2019m excited to buy more of amid fierce sector rotation. Still, its fortress balance sheet and ecosystem stickiness should prevent meaningful underperformance if tech stabilizes. I rank AAPL stock a tepid buy simply due to its relative resilience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

International Business Machines Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nA Glimpse at International Business Machines Corp's Dividend History\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1986, with dividends currently distributed on a quarterly basis. International Business Machines Corp has increased its dividend each year since 1994, earning it the status of a dividend aristocrata title reserved for companies that have raised their dividends annually for at least 30 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends. International Business Machines Corp's Dividend Analysis\n\nBreaking Down International Business Machines Corp's Dividend Yield and Growth\n\nAs of today, International Business Machines Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.63% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.64%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past three years, International Business Machines Corp's annual dividend growth rate was 0.60%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 1.20% per year. And over the past decade, International Business Machines Corp's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 5.50%. Based on International Business Machines Corp's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of International Business Machines Corp stock as of today is approximately 3.85%.\n\nThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, International Business Machines Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.69.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks International Business Machines Corp's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.\n\nGrowth Metrics: The Future Outlook\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. International Business Machines Corp's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and International Business Machines Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. International Business Machines Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 2.90% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 64.46% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, International Business Machines Corp's earnings increased by approximately 3.50% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 59.04% of global competitors.\n\nLastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -8.00%, which underperforms approximately 82.39% of global competitors, may raise concerns about its ability to sustain dividend growth in the longer term.\n\nConcluding Insights on IBM's Dividend Outlook\n\nIn conclusion, while International Business Machines Corp's dividend history and current yield are attractive, the sustainability of its dividends is contingent upon the company's future growth and profitability. The payout ratio indicates a healthy balance between earnings distribution and retention for growth. However, mixed growth metrics suggest investors should keep a close watch on the company's performance. Will IBM's strategic initiatives in cloud computing and artificial intelligence translate into stronger growth and support its dividend aristocrat status? This remains an essential question for value investors considering IBM as a long-term income investment.\n\nGuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

And according to Palantir, it's a key reason it expects US commercial revenue to grow nearly 40% in 2024.\n\nIt's also the reason the stock that had surged more than 100% over the past year as AI euphoria sent many tech stocks roaring. Amid calls that Denver-based Palantir's stock was already overvalued, Tuesday's market action is the latest sign that investors haven't had enough of the AI trade\u2014even if Wall Street believes parts of the trade have extended beyond any fundamental backing.\n\n\"We are incredibly bullish on Palanitr,\" Moringstar equity analyst Malik Ahmed Kahn told Yahoo Finance Live. \"If you look at our forecasts you would see us being above consensus on profitability, on revenue, etc.\n\n\"At the same time,\" he added, \"we can not rationalize Palantir's current valuation in the bear case.\"\n\nJefferies equity analyst Brent Thill, who entered the earnings report with a sell rating on Palantir, conceded in a research note after the release that the AIP growth is exceeding expectations. But even after upgrading the stock to a Hold rating, Thill still warned about the cost of the stock.\n\n\"The biggest concern is valuation with stock trading at a 23% premium to the large cap average,\" Thill wrote.\n\nIt's not just Palantir that's been catching a fresh bid on AI hopes to start 2024. On Monday, Goldman Sachs boosted its price target on Nvidia stock to $800 from $625, citing \"robust AI demand,\" among other things. The stock jumped almost 5% to a fresh all-time high.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso: IBM (IBM) stock is up about 15% over the past month after AI demand fueled a revenue beat.  AI leader Microsoft (MSFT) saw a muted reaction to earnings, even as the company attributed AI services to 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue. But in fairness, the stock is also trading just short of an all-time high and is up more than 10% in the last month. The same could be said for AMD (AMD) which didn't soar on its AI driven earnings beat, but is up over 25% in the last month and hovering near an all-time high.\n\nThe moves beg the question for investors: when will AI euphoria reach a price that investors are no longer willing to pay? To Kahn at Morningstar that could rely on how the US economy performs for the rest of the year.\n\n\"There is a chance that if the economy remains strong, customers will continue to invest in some of those newer growth areas,\" Kahn said. \"At the same time, if we're looking at a recession or we're looking at something else going on in the wider economy and the economy is is not as strong at that point, you will probably have investors sort of dial back some of their investments.\" The Palantir Technologies logo is displayed on a shipping container at the companys booth during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 5, 2023.

On Monday, Goldman Sachs boosted its price target on Nvidia stock (NVDA) to $800 from $625, citing \"robust AI demand,\" among other things. The stock jumped almost 5% to a fresh all-time high.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, IBM (IBM) stock is up about 15% over the past month after AI demand fueled a revenue beat. AI leader Microsoft (MSFT) saw a muted reaction to earnings, even as the company attributed AI services to 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue. But in fairness, the stock is also trading just short of an all-time high and is up more than 10% in the last month. The same could be said for AMD (AMD), which didn't soar on its AI-driven earnings beat but is up over 25% in the last month and hovering near an all-time high.\n\nThe moves raise the question for investors: When will AI euphoria reach a price that investors are no longer willing to pay? To Khan at Morningstar, that could rely on how the US economy performs for the rest of the year.\n\n\"There is a chance that if the economy remains strong, customers will continue to invest in some of those newer growth areas,\" Khan said. \"At the same time, if we're looking at a recession or we're looking at something else going on in the wider economy and the economy is is not as strong at that point, you will probably have investors sort of dial back some of their investments.\" The Palantir Technologies logo is displayed on a shipping container at the company's booth during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 5, 2023.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks Worth Holding for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Investing in\u00a0dividend stocks is generally reserved for those who prefer steady returns and low volatility over the thrill of rapid potential gains. Investors saw tech stocks explode in 2023 as artificial intelligence emerged. In 2024, investors expect further growth but are also hesitant.\n\nEconomists believe that a soft landing is the most likely scenario. Let\u2019s all hope that that\u2019s the case. However, it also makes sense to bolster your portfolio simultaneously with the safety of dividend stocks.\n\nAs with all others, February is a great month to invest in dividend stocks. Investors seeking income and stability should consider these buy-and-hold dividend stocks during the month and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDividend Stocks: AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie\u2019s (NYSE:ABBV) The story regarding its blockbuster drug Humira has been told many times. It\u2019s worth telling you again because it shows precisely why investors should consider the pharmaceutical stock, which offers an excellent dividend.\n\nHumira has been a massive success as one of the greatest-selling pharmaceuticals ever. However, It also lost patent exclusivity in 2023. Biosimilar competition is now allowed, and Humira\u2019s sales are rapidly declining. This outcome has long been expected and is not surprising to anyone who follows the company. The question is really about what AbbVie can do as Humira declines.\n\nThe answer is that the company is finding sales from elsewhere within the same immunology class of drugs. Rinvoq and Skyrizi\u00a0grew at rates above 50% in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s serving to soften the blow of Humira\u2019s decline. Humira is an outside contributor to the company\u2019s success, but sales only declined by 6% overall.\n\nThe company has a lot of growth potential in Rinvoq and Skyrizi and Recent acquisitions. Investors who get on board with the company\u2019s strategy will receive a dividend yielding 3.7%, which was last reduced in 1972.\n\nStory continues\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock will not attract many investors based on the strength of its dividend yield alone. That yield is a very modest 1.2% at the moment. However, what it lacks in raw income power, it makes up for in many other ways.\n\nPrimarily, Occidental Petroleum is a strong contrarian play for those who believe in the Warren Buffett school of investing. His Berkshire Hathaway\u00a0currently owns 34% of the equity in Occidental Petroleum. His firm has been buying the company over the last several quarters, and he is particularly big on the company because of its balance sheet and macroeconomic factors. Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway believe that instability in the Middle East will lead to a resurgence in oil prices.\n\nThe company has been buying OXY shares rapidly, particularly when they fall below the $60 threshold. The energy sector was the weakest performer in 2023 after 2022, which saw it as the strongest sector. The story of 2024 has yet to be told, but geopolitical instability will play a large role in the sector\u2019s performance this year.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) feels like a very solid stock to invest in now. While the company arguably has a solid reputation, a lot of growth is coming. More accurately, McDonald\u2019s is already growing quite rapidly.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent Financial results tell a simple story. The company\u2019s Top Line is growing at roughly 10% within the United States and even faster internationally. McDonald\u2019s is not satisfied and continues to seek much greater growth.\n\nThe company aims to grow its restaurant count to 50,000 by 2027. If it is successful, that will be the fastest period of growth in its history. Meanwhile, McDonald\u2019s is also approaching growth in new areas\u2014namely, high-margin drinks sold by competitors like\u00a0Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nIts recent brand extension with\u00a0CosMc\u2019s is receiving an early strong reception. There\u2019s a lot to like about the company\u2019s growth strategy, even more so when considering its 2.3% dividend.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock is humming along primarily due to optimism around artificial intelligence. 2024 promises to be another strong year for the emerging AI sector. IBM believes that growth will continue to be strong, which could catalyze its shares higher.\n\nThe company released earnings a few weeks ago, which were particularly strong. Free cash flows were well above expectations, reaching\u00a0$11.2 billion. Further, margins reached their highest levels since 1999.\n\nInvestors will pay particular attention to continued growth from IBM\u2019s artificial intelligence offerings. Its book of business for generative artificial intelligence doubled between Q3 and Q4. The company is relying on some of that AI prowess to catalyze a reduction in the workforce. As a result, IBM is finding greater efficiencies and has a decreased need for human labor.\n\nIt\u2019s not so great if you\u2019re an IBM employee, but it\u2019s very welcome for investors as labor costs are commonly the greatest expense overall.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is among the better-known Healthcare stocks overall. The healthcare sector is noted for its reliability and lack of volatility. The reason is very simple: Consumers utilize healthcare at relatively steady rates that don\u2019t correlate with cyclical economic fluctuations.\n\nIn short, Medtronic is predictable. The company gives guidance, and it\u2019s not common for it to change it. Yet, Medtronic did exactly that when it reported second-quarter results in late November. Medtronic\u00a0increased its fiscal year 2024 revenue growth and EPS guidance, a strong sign overall.\n\nPart of the optimism derives from product approvals. Medtronic received FDA approval for several devices related to its cardiac business.\n\nOverall, Medtronic is an excellent example of what a dividend stock should be. The company\u00a0last reduced the dividend in 1978, implying extreme reliability. Moreover, Medtronic has grown its dividend by more than 8% over the last five years. Strong dividend growth is a particularly important sign for investors, and Medtronic has exactly that.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Albuquerque, New Mexico / USA - November 2 2020: Boxes of Band-Aids in Walmart in the pharmacy and over-the-counter medication aisle. Kenvue (KVUE) split from JNJ and now owns the Band-aid brand.\n\nSource: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com\n\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is the relatively new spin-off of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) consumer healthcare division. The stock currently trades for around $21, below its IPO of $22.\n\nThat IPO occurred back in May of 2023, and Kenvue currently pays a dividend yielding 3.7%, making it a young, optimistic investment. Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson due to controversies surrounding its products\u2019 health. It\u2019s fair to argue that Johnson & Johnson sought to get rid of its consumer Healthcare brands because they simply didn\u2019t do as much for its bottom line as its medical device sector.\n\nThe company now has a chance to prove that its consumer Healthcare brands can stand alone as a stock and generate returns. The point here is that its shares are currently quite cheap and include a high-yield dividend approaching 4%. Analysts don\u2019t expect that those shares will decline much, if at all. Instead, they believe they\u00a0could rise by as much as 50%. Even if they don\u2019t, investors will have a nice healthy chunk of dividend income in the worst-case scenario.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock, like Kenvue, includes a dividend that yields more than 3%. And like Kenvue, NextEra Energy has seen better days.\n\nThe company is one of the more unique investments in energy. It is part utility firm and part renewable energy firm, both of which are the largest respective companies in the world in their sector. The utilities side of the business is called Florida Power and Light. It had a particularly\u00a0strong fourth quarter, with net income rising to $1.146 billion from $763 million a year earlier.\n\nHowever, its renewable resource business did not fare as well. Net income from NextEra Energy Resources fell from $995 million to $893 million during Q4.\n\nNextEra Energy benefits from the strength of its utility business, but ultimately, it remains at the mercy of greater narratives around green energy. 2024 should be a much better year for the solar and wind projects in which the company is particularly well invested.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Market predictions for this creative new area are going through the roof as more money comes in from both the public and private sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHence, with each step forward, quantum computing\u2019s promise grows, calling for a closer look at how it will change the tech world and other fields. Keeping this in mind, let us explore three big players in the quantum computing stocks space.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a leader in quantum computing, which is a new and exciting field. The \u201cIBM Quantum Heron\u201d engine that it just released is a big step forward. The company that made this processor says it has increased the rate of mistake reduction by five times. This kind of useful improvement is necessary to make sure that any solution is reliable.\n\nThe \u201cIBM Quantum System Two\u201d was also shown. This amazing flexible quantum computer was an idea that IBM came up with to make quantum computing more scalable. It started using three Heron computers in its work, showing that it was open to new technology.\n\nIBM\u2019s plan for quantum computing is both useful and far-fetched. Its main goal is to make the gate operations better, which will make the quantum circuit bigger. That\u2019s how the full promise of quantum computing will be used in the end.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM released Qiskit 1.0, which made quantum computing easier to use from a software point of view. Quartz devices are easy to run with this open-source software. It is a step toward democracy in the quantum world.\n\nIn conclusion, IBM is changing the future of quantum computing by developing a worldwide ecosystem that improves researcher cooperation and helps companies solve difficult problems quickly. Through its strategic relationships with academic, scientific, and industry institutions, IBM takes the lead in the realm of quantum computing. Notably, these collaborations serve to enhance innovation and, consequently, could significantly accelerate the acceptance and further development of quantum computing. This, in turn, solidifies and reinforces IBM\u2019s dominant position in this rapidly evolving and fascinating field.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A digital rendering of a circuit board and digital chip in neon colors to illustrate quantum computing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) has done something amazing that makes it stand out in the world of quantum computing. The IonQ Forte device from the company had 35 computational qubits. It took a whole year longer than planned to reach this goal. It\u2019s a big step forward for quantum computers.\n\nThis new information puts IonQ at the top of the list of stocks for quantum computing. The improved system can work with quantum devices that are bigger. For this reason, it works great for complicated tasks in quantum machine learning and science.\n\nIonQ\u2019s success comes from the way it optimizes everything. Both hardware and software got better. The company added more qubits and made a quantum program generator that works better.\n\nIonQ\u2019s dedication to accuracy is shown by the use of the AQ measure. It lets the machine look into more than 34 billion possible outcomes. This makes it possible for quantum computing to go in new directions.\n\nThe progress made by IonQ has wide-ranging effects. More complicated devices and programs can be run with their help. You can use the company\u2019s technology on all the big cloud systems.\n\nAltogether, IonQ\u2019s accomplishments show how important it is to bring quantum computing into the business world. The company\u2019s progress essentially shows how quantum computing will be used to solve hard tasks in the future. IonQ\u2019s journey shows how committed it is to being innovative and the best in the area of quantum computing.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing.

        "title": "New IBM LinuxONE 4 Express to Offer Cost Savings and Client Value through a Cyber Resilient Hybrid Cloud and AI Platform",
        "content": "Newest IBM LinuxONE system is engineered to deliver cybersecurity, resiliency, scalability and AI inferencing for hybrid cloud environments. Moving Linux workloads from a compared x86 system to an IBM LinuxONE 4 Express can save over 52% on the total cost of ownership over 5 years.1\n\nARMONK, N.Y., Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced IBM\u00ae LinuxONE 4 Express, extending the latest performance, security and AI capabilities of LinuxONE to small and medium sized businesses and within new data center environments. The pre-configured rack mount system is designed to offer cost savings and to remove client guess work when spinning up workloads quickly and getting started with the platform to address new and traditional use cases such as digital assets, medical imaging with AI, and workload consolidation. IBM LinuxONE 4 Express\n\nBuilding an integrated hybrid cloud strategy for today and years to come\n\nAs businesses move their products and services online quickly, oftentimes, they are left with a hybrid cloud environment created by default, with siloed stacks that are not conducive to alignment across businesses or the introduction of AI. In a recent IBM IBV survey, 84% of executives asked acknowledged their enterprise struggles in eliminating silo-to-silo handoffs. And 78% of responding executives said that an inadequate operating model impedes successful adoption of their multicloud platform.2 With the pressure to accelerate and scale the impact of data and AI across the enterprise \u2013 and improve business outcomes \u2013 another approach that organizations can take is to more carefully identify which workloads should be on-premises vs in the cloud.\n\n\"IBM\u00a0LinuxONE 4 Express is a chance for startups and small to medium-sized businesses to build an intentional hybrid cloud strategy from the ground up. IBM brings the power of hybrid cloud and AI in the latest LinuxONE 4 system to a simple, easy to use format that fits in many data centers,\" said Tina Tarquinio, VP, Product Management, IBM Z and LinuxONE. \"And as their businesses grow with the changing shifts in the market, LinuxONE 4 Express can scale to meet growing workload and performance requirements, in addition to offering AI inferencing co-located with mission-critical data for growing AI use cases.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerating computing research for bio sciences\n\nUniversity College London is one of largest universities in the UK and well-known for their reputation as a public research institution. They've been working with IBM to build a sustainable hybrid cloud platform to support their academic research.\n\n\"Our Centre for Advanced Research Computing is critical to enable computational research across the sciences and humanities, as well as digital scholarship for students,\" said Dr. Owain Kenway, Head of Research Computing at University College London. \"We're excited for LinuxONE 4 Express to support high I/O workloads like Next Generation Sequencing for Biosciences as well as supporting work in\u00a0\"Trusted Research Environments\" (TREs), for example AI workloads on medical data. The system's high performance and scalability suit our crucial research needs, and its affordability will allow us to make it available to both university research and industry players as a test bed.\"\n\nDelivering high scalability, availability and security for a range of data center environments and use cases\n\nIBM LinuxONE Rockhopper 4, launched in\u00a0April 2023 and based on the IBM Telum processor, features capabilities designed to reduce both energy consumption and data center floor space while delivering the scale, performance and security that clients need.\u00a0Also built on the Telum processor and delivered in a rack mount format, IBM LinuxONE 4 Express offers high availability for clients who have strict resiliency requirements due to internal or external regulations. In fact, IBM LinuxONE 4 Express systems, with GDPS, IBM DS8000 series storage with HyperSwap and running a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment, are designed to deliver 99.999999% (eight 9s) availability.3\n\n\"IBM LinuxONE is rapidly becoming a foundational part of the wider Infrastructure story within IBM,\" states Steven Dickens, VP and Practice Leader at The Futurum Group. \"With the new LinuxONE 4 Express solution, IBM is uniquely positioned to handle mission-critical workloads with high availability. When you combine this with the system's cybersecurity posture, IBM is well positioned for market traction.\"\n\nThe system addresses a whole new set of use cases that startups and small businesses are facing, including:\n\nDigital assets: IBM LinuxONE 4 Express provides a secured platform with confidential computing capabilities specifically designed to protect sensitive data, like digital assets. IBM Secure Execution for Linux is a hardware-based security technology that is now built into IBM LinuxONE 4 Express. Scalable isolation for individual workloads can help protect not only from external attacks, but also insider threats. This includes data in use, a particularly critical stage of security for digital assets use cases.

        "content": "Quantum computing is a new field of computing which utilizes quantum mechanics to produce machines that can handle far more calculations than traditional computers.\n\nThe goal of quantum computing is to produce qubits, which are a measure of computing capacity. So far, the industry hasn\u2019t managed to sustainably achieve enough qubits to supplant other types of supercomputers.\n\nBut with analysts suggesting that the industry could reach a viable qubit computing level within the next few years, quantum computing stocks could be set for exponential gains over the next five to ten years. Here are three of the leaders in this emerging industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nWhen thinking of pureplay quantum computing stocks, IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) should be the first name that comes to mind.\n\nIonQ has been first-to-market in a number of ways. It has tremendous partnerships, it is available on leading cloud computing platforms and it has some of the best minds and intellectual property in the industry.\n\nAnd while quantum computing is still at the very beginning of monetization, IonQ has started to generate appreciable commercial revenues. In its Q3 results, the company\u2019s $6.1 million of revenues rose 121% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of prior guidance. The company boosted its full-year guidance and bookings outlook once again. Additionally, IonQ reached $100 million in cumulative product bookings in the first three years of its commercial phase of operations.\n\nSkeptics like to criticize quantum computing as a science project that hasn\u2019t yet achieved notable real-world results. That\u2019s certainly been true to some extent in the past. However, IonQ is making admirable progress in turning quantum computing from a dream into a reality. It also has a strong balance sheet with plenty of cash to fund its operations while it scales toward profitability.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors often tend to think of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as a stodgy consulting and IT services company. And that makes up a huge piece of the company\u2019s operations, to be certain.\n\nHowever, IBM has always prided itself on innovation, long leading the world in the number of patents that its researchers obtain. Its commitment to R&D has paid off over the years, and that\u2019s become increasingly apparent in recent months.\n\nIBM stock has rocketed higher over the past quarter thanks to significant acceleration in the firm\u2019s cloud and artificial intelligence operations. And investors shouldn\u2019t sleep on IBM\u2019s quantum division either.\n\nIn fact, IBM has the world\u2019s largest quantum computing fleet in the world with its Qiskit Runtime system. Hundreds of institutions including leading research universities, Fortune 500 companies and research labs have joined IBM\u2019s Quantum Network. It offers access to 100+ qubit devices. Over time, IBM believes its quantum computing solutions should aid companies in key fields such as cybersecurity while layering nicely onto IBM\u2019s existing cloud and AI solutions.\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NYSE:HON) is a leading industrial company. Its roots go back to Butz-Thermo Electric Regulator, a company which developed the first predecessor to the modern thermostat. Over the decades, Honeywell has created all sorts of inventions including barcodes, unleaded gasoline, biodegradable detergents and aviation autopilots.\n\nGiven that context, it shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising that Honeywell continues to come up with new innovations outside of its present core industrial business. Such as quantum computing.\n\nHoneywell believes that quantum computing will be integral for managing supply chains and industrial automation. Given the high number of constantly changing variables in managing these logistical puzzles, a next-gen quantum computer could potentially be orders of magnitude more efficient in designing and overseeing these systems.\n\nTo this point, Honeywell helped generate novel discoveries in quantum computing, and it has spun that unit out into a separate firm, Quantinuum, which is pursuing solutions in cybersecurity, drug discovery, AI, and finance among other fields. Honeywell retains a majority shareholding in Quantinuum, and the firm just raised funds at a $5 billion valuation in January.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in IBM stock.

        "title": "Meta Is Now a Dividend Stock, but This Tech Giant Is a Better Buy",
        "content": "The big surprise in Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) fourth-quarter earnings report last week was the initiation of the social media giant's first-ever dividend. Meta will pay $0.50 per share to shareholders of record on Feb. 22. On an annualized basis, that works out to a dividend yield of about 0.5%.\n\nThis dividend yield will likely grow over time as Meta boosts its payout, although share buybacks are still a big part of the equation. Along with the dividend announcement, Meta disclosed that an additional $50 billion had been allocated for share buybacks. Meta poured nearly $20 billion into buying back its own stock in 2023; the dividend will eat up just over $5 billion over the next year if it remains at its current level.\n\nA tough sell for dividend investors\n\nFor dividend investors, Meta is a tough sell. There's plenty of room to grow the dividend over time; Meta reported a net income of $39 billion and a free cash flow of $44 billion for 2023. However, share buybacks appear to be the priority. If Meta takes the same path as Apple, which has been paying a dividend for a decade but still sports a dividend yield of around 0.5%, the dividend will never be all that consequential.\n\nAnother wrinkle is Meta's valuation. The stock isn't overly expensive, but it's not cheap, either. With a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion following a post-earnings rally, the stock trades for roughly 27 times free cash flow.\n\nWhile Meta reported strong growth in Q4, with revenue surging 25% year over year and net income more than tripling, there's plenty of long-term uncertainty. For one, the core social media business faces the prospect of increased regulation. \"We could regulate you out of business if we wanted to,\" said Senator Thom Tillis during a recent Senate hearing with top social media executives focused on child safety.\n\nMeta's vast investments in the metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) also have unclear and uncertain payoffs. Reality Labs, Meta's metaverse-focused division, reported an operating loss of $16 billion in 2023, and the company is pouring additional cash into AI hardware. Improving its various platforms with AI features makes sense, but it will be an expensive proposition.\n\nStory continues\n\nA better deal for dividend investors\n\nFor those not sold on Meta's long-term potential, International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) looks like a far better deal. IBM's artificial intelligence strategy is crystal clear: Help its enterprise clients deploy AI technology through a mix of software and consulting services.\n\nWhile IBM's watsonx AI platform is a key component of this strategy, consulting is what brings customers in the door. The company disclosed in its Q4 report that AI commitments from customers doubled in Q4 from Q3, with two-thirds of business driven by the consulting arm.\n\nIBM produced $11.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023, and strong demand for AI products and services will contribute to growth in 2024. The company is eyeing $12 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at about 14, or roughly half that of Meta.\n\nIBM is growing more slowly than Meta, with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected for 2024. However, IBM's business comes with less uncertainty. While demand for IBM's enterprise software and services will ebb and flow with economic conditions, the company doesn't face existential threats like Meta's social media business, and it isn't relying on a moonshot like Meta's metaverse business.\n\nThen there's the dividend. IBM has paid a quarterly dividend uninterrupted since 1916, and it's raised that dividend annually for nearly three decades. Based on the latest quarterly payment of $1.66 per share, IBM stock currently sports a dividend yield of about 3.6%, more than double the S&P 500's meager 1.4% yield.\n\nThat dividend is well covered by free cash flow. IBM is set to pay out approximately $6.1 billion in dividends over the next year, which will eat up a hair over 50% of its free cash flow. This leaves plenty left over for other uses, including debt reduction, acquisitions, and a potential restart of share buybacks. IBM suspended all share buybacks after its megadeal for software company Red Hat closed in 2019.\n\nShares of IBM have rallied over the past year, gaining nearly 40% as investors started to buy into the company's growth story. While IBM isn't a growth stock like Meta, a combination of less uncertainty, a discounted valuation, and a far more generous dividend makes IBM stock a better buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An internal letter criticizing SAP SE\u2019s back-to-office policy has attracted more than 5,000 signatures in less than two weeks, with the German software company\u2019s employees threatening to look for other jobs rather than return.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk\u2019s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World\u2019s Biggest Fortune Trump Risks Losing More Than Half of Swing-State Voters If Found Guilty S&P 500 Has Its Worst Fed-Decision Day Since March: Markets Wrap Byron Allen\u2019s Latest Takeover Bid: Paramount for $14 Billion NY Community Bancorp Plunges as Real Estate Risks Jolt Market\n\n\u201cWe feel betrayed by a company that until recently encouraged us to work from home, only to ask for a radical change in direction,\u201d according to the letter, which was posted internally and seen by Bloomberg News. The company\u2019s European works council, a group that represents SAP\u2019s employees on the continent, said the requirement to be back in the office was unreasonable after employees had been told they could continue remotely.\n\nSAP, Europe\u2019s largest software company, outlined a new guidance in early January that will require employees globally to work in an office or on site with a customer three days a week from April. SAP Chief Executive Office Christian Klein has pushed back on the works council\u2019s opposition and said that working from home will cost SAP its culture and teamwork.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big believer that on a video conference platform you can understand our culture, you can get educated, and you can get enabled to do your job best,\u201d Klein said last week following the company\u2019s financial results.\n\nSAP, in a statement Wednesday, said \u201cstriking the right balance between remote and on-site work helps drive productivity, innovation and employee well-being. We\u2019re evolving our flexible work policy to align with best practices in the market and our own experience as a front runner in hybrid work.\u201d\n\nMany companies have increased return-to-office requirements over the last year, replacing employee-friendly incentives like happy hours and commuter subsidies with more punitive measures including disciplinary action or limited career advancement if attendance targets aren\u2019t met. Earlier this month, International Business Machines Corp. told managers they\u2019d be required to move near an office and start attending three times a week unless they wanted to leave the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: IBM to Managers: Move Near an Office or Leave Company\n\nReturn-to-office rules are often seen as fueling attrition. The SAP employees wrote in their letter that if the new requirement is intended as a \u201czero-cost staff reduction strategy,\u201d it will only drive away talented employees.\n\nThe tech industry in particular has seen a tightening of rules as the market soured and the risk of job cuts has tipped the scale in favor of employers. Still, US office attendance remained fairly stagnant throughout 2023, according to data from office security company Kastle Systems. Across the 10 largest business districts in the US, the number of workers in the office hovered around 50% of what it was before the pandemic, with tech-heavy regions like the San Francisco Bay Area reporting even lower percentages.\n\nLess than a month after presenting the back-to-office policy, SAP announced restructuring that would affect 8,000 employees. SAP said it would identify \u201cAI-driven efficiencies\u201d in its operations and restructure parts of the business to deal with the changes. The company says it plans to end 2024 with a headcount similar to current levels. SAP had almost 108,000 employees as of the end of December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRead More: SAP Shares Surge on 8,000-Job Restructuring to Build Out AI\n\n\u201cWe are the ones that learned to adapt to the absence of significant salary increases over the years,\u201d the works council said in the letter, which had been viewed more than 100,000 times. \u201cTo compensate for this, we took advantage of the remote work possibility and moved where living costs were lower, away from expensive metropolises.\u201d\n\n(Updates with comments from letter in the seventh paragraph.

        "content": "While technology stocks continue to drive the market higher, they are not the only game in town. Investors needn\u2019t invest only in semiconductor stocks to achieve big gains. Many blue-chip stocks are rallying right now following the release of their financial results for the fourth and final quarter of 2023.\n\nThe names of a lot of these worthwhile stocks will be familiar to investors. And for good reason. They tend to be dominant companies and brands that provide goods and services many of us find essential in our lives. Profitable, flush with cash and with a strong growth trajectory, these blue-chip stocks make for solid long-term investments. They can easily form the foundation of any portfolio, and investors can expect consistent returns from them. Here are the seven best blue-chip stocks to invest in for big gains in 2024.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Visa (NYSE:V) is trending upwards after the credit card giant issued fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts. The company, which operates the world\u2019s biggest payments network, reported Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.41, topping analyst estimates of $2.34. Revenue amounted to $8.60 billion, up more than 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of forward guidance, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the upper-mid to high-single digits and profit growth in the high-teens. The payments company continues to benefit from strong consumer spending and retail sales. Its payment volumes, which cover the holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company\u2019s total transactions for Q4 2023 rose 9% to $57.50 billion.\n\nV stock is up 7% so far in 2024 and has gained 21% in the last 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on a tear currently and has achieved an important milestone. For the first time ever, Microsoft\u2019s market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company and becoming only the second concern in history to achieve a $3 trillion market cap, besting rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the process. On Jan. 25, MSFT stock finished trading with a market valuation of $3.009 trillion, slightly ahead of Apple at $3.002 trillion.\n\nThe $3 trillion milestone comes four years after Microsoft first reached a $1 trillion market cap, back in April 2019. Microsoft has been a publicly traded company since 1986. The company\u2019s market value reached $2 trillion in June 2021, and has now topped $3 trillion. The new milestone was reached as MSFT stock has gained 11% so far in 2024, bringing its 12-month increase to 69%. The company\u2019s stock continues to rally higher on investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flights\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter four bruising years, airline stocks look to be making a comeback, led by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). The stock of the world\u2019s largest airline is up 9% year to date, driven higher after the carrier announced better-than-expected Q4 2023 financial results and offered a bullish outlook for the year ahead. American Airlines posted Q4 EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $13.10 billion. Wall Street had expected a profit of 11 cents on sales of $13 billion.\n\nWhile the Q4 numbers were impressive, so too was the guidance issued by American Airlines. The company said that it expects to report earnings of $2.25 to $3.25 a share for all of 2024. Analysts who were polled by FactSet expected full-year earnings of $2.14 a share. The airline said that it continues to benefit from strength in air travel coming out of the pandemic, including record bookings over the recent year-end holidays.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe share price of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is up 5% early in the year as the consumer-goods company continues to demonstrate that it has pricing power and consumer loyalty on its side. Procter & Gamble, whose products include Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razor blades, reported Q4 2023 EPS of $1.84 versus $1.70 that had been forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $21.44 billion versus $21.48 billion that had been expected. The company\u2019s sales increased 3% from a year earlier.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Procter & Gamble said it anticipates fiscal 2024 earnings growth of 1%, down from a previous forecast of 6%. However, the company\u2019s guidance tends to be conservative. Plus, Procter and Gamble expects its results to be impacted by a $1.3 billion charge related to a drop in the book value of its Gillette razor blade business as volume growth slows due to hybrid work trends. Still, PG stock is up 11% in the past year, making it a a good blue-chip stock to invest in.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nShares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) are red hot to start the year. The technology company\u2019s stock has gained 16% in the month of January, bringing its 12 month increase to nearly 40%. The catalyst for the move higher was a strong Q4 financial print that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations. IBM reported EPS of $3.87 versus $3.78 that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue for the October through December quarter totaled $17.38 billion compared to $17.30 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street.\n\nA deeper dive into the numbers, and IBM\u2019s results look even better. Free cash flow for all of 2023 totaled $11.20 billion, more than the $10.50 billion that management had guided for. And the company\u2019s Q4 gross margin of 59.1% was the highest since 1999. Perhaps best of all, the company said that its business related to generative AI was double the size it was in Q3 of last year. Looking ahead, IBM said that it expects $12 billion in free cash flow and revenue growth in the mid-single digits for 2024.\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBank stocks continue to struggle. However, a growing number of analysts are lending their support. Recently, analysts at Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) issued a note to clients arguing that stocks of banks and other financial services firms are \u201csignificantly undervalued,\u201d ready to rebound, and that it\u2019s time to buy. Among the stocks of financial institutions, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) looks particularly cheap with its share price down 15% in the last year and currently trading at 25 times future earnings estimates.\n\nIn January, Charles Schwab reported Q4 earnings that bested Wall Street forecasts even though its revenue and profits declined from a year earlier. The financial services firm announced Q4 EPS of 68 cents, which was ahead of consensus estimates that called for 64 cents. Revenue in the final quarter of 2023 totaled $4.45 billion, matching forecasts. Charles Schwab has struggled as high interest rates prompt customers to move money out of low-yielding accounts and into better paying money-market funds.\n\nHowever, with inflation declining and interest rates on the cusp of being lowered, the year ahead should be kinder to SCHW stock.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical companies have had a difficult time over the past year. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), for one, has endured a rough road, particularly as it hived off its consumer health unit into a new company called Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), the biggest change in the company\u2019s 138-year history. In the last 12 months, JNJ stock has slumped 2%. In 2024, the shares are essentially flat. However, there are indications that better days are ahead for this stalwart blue-chip stock.\n\nRecently, Johnson & Johnson issued better-than-expected Q4 earnings due largely to strong sales in its medical device business unit. The company announced EPS of $2.29 versus $2.28 that had been forecast on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $21.40 billion versus $21.01 billion that had been expected among analysts. Johnson & Johnson said the strong results were due largely to a 13.3% year-over-year increase in sales of its medical devices, which generated revenue of $7.67 billion in Q4. The company also continues to take steps to resolve accusations that its baby powder caused cancer in some people.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and AAPL.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best consistent dividend stocks to invest in. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the performance of dividend growers over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\n\nMaintaining a consistent approach is crucial in the realm of investing in dividend stocks. Numerous American companies have adhered to this principle, contributing to a notable increase in dividend distributions over the years. S&P Dow Jones Indices data revealed that the dividend payments of S&P 500 companies totaled $420 billion in 2017, surging to $565 billion in 2022. The trend continued in 2023, setting a new record with dividend payments reaching an impressive $588.2 billion. The most recent report from S&P Dow Jones pointed out that there were 707 instances of dividend increases in the fourth quarter of 2023. The cumulative amount of these increases reached $17.5 billion for the quarter, marking an increase from the $16.3 billion reported in the same period of 2022.\n\nCompanies displaying consistent growth in dividends have attracted the interest of investors, prompting companies to undertake the challenging task of sustaining and expanding their dividends, even during market downturns. This strategic approach has proven to be beneficial for these companies, as those experiencing dividend growth have yielded substantial returns over the years. According to a Cohen & Steers report, during the decade leading up to 2010, dividend-paying companies outpaced non-payers by 620 basis points annually, with significantly lower risk measured by standard deviation. Over a 30-year period ending in 2011, the advantage of dividend-paying companies becomes even more pronounced. Notably, across each time frame during this period, the subset of dividend payers that increased or initiated dividends in the preceding 12 months exhibited higher returns and lower volatility compared to both payers and non-payers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from delivering robust returns, consistent dividend stocks have been playing a significant role in generating personal income. As per findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividends have progressively become a more substantial source of income over the past four decades. In December 1981, dividends constituted only 2.88% of total income, a figure that has increased to 6.25% of all income as of March 2022. The report also highlighted the average year-over-year annual percentage growth rate in dividends for the existing constituents of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. Over the last 15 years, the average year-over-year dividend growth rate stood at 13.71%, outpacing the average year-over-year U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of 2.21% during the same timeframe.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best consistent dividend stocks as these companies have raised their dividends regularly for decades.

        "content": "Quantum computers have just started to enter the mainstream awareness. Although the shift from classical to quantum computers is still ongoing and the technology experimental, the potential consequences could be far-reaching once we successfully harness the technology to society\u2019s benefit. That puts the spotlight on quantum innovation stocks leading the way forward.\n\nNote that these quantum innovation stocks are approaching the idea and unique problems of quantum computing differently. Some are taking a high-risk, experimental approach that delves deep into the unexplored regions of physics and engineering, while others are taking the more conservative track \u2014 one that\u2019s better understood.\n\nIn this article, I present three companies considered quantum innovation stocks and detail their approaches and progress to get their respective quantum systems online and commercialized. Here are the companies to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) has been a leader in quantum computing research for years. It is one of the first companies to supply customers with cloud-based quantum computing systems, and the company recently announced it was broadening its hardware offerings, too.\n\nThe company recently announced plans to install an IBM Quantum Systems Two processor at KQC\u2019s facility in Busan, Korea, by 2028. The processor is expected to be part of the IBM Flamingo family, featuring 156 qubits per module and support for up to 7 modules.\n\nThe big picture is that this reportedly attracted the attention of blue-chip clients in the Korean financial, bio-healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors. Those sectors could be heavy experimental users of quantum machines.\n\nQuantum computers are exponentially more powerful than classical computers, and their commercialization could lead to crucial scientific developments and breakthroughs presently unreachable.\n\nTrading at just 24.6 times earnings, IBM could be seen as undervalued in light of its progress in quantum computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made significant strides in quantum computing. The company claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy in 2019. Since then, it has worked tirelessly to improve the stability and power of its quantum systems.\n\nThe company claims to be leading the quantum computing arms race, which it is apparently demonstrating by reducing the error rates of its quantum system. Last year, Google\u2019s 3rd generation Sycamore processor was reported to typically experience error rates between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100.\n\nThe above progress marks the second step in Google\u2019s roadmap to building an error-corrected quantum computer, and its progress seems to be accelerating.\n\nI think quantum as an additional growth tailwind makes Alphabet a strong buy. In the short term, analysts expect its EPS to surge 16.36% in FY2024, so this may give investors something more immediate while they wait for the quantum computing market to hit its full stride.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech behemoth with substantial interest in quantum technologies.\n\nMSFT, in my opinion, is one of the better stocks positioned to take advantage of this computing development. That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the few companies to release its development toolkit \u2014 Q#.\n\nThat is a highly underappreciated feature and seems to be unique to Microsoft. Q# is the programming language developers will use to develop sophisticated quantum algorithms to power applications. MSFT is already courting developers to learn and utilize this language, which interfaces with Microsoft\u2019s cloud service, Azure.\n\nHypothetically, suppose Q# gains widespread acceptance amongst developers. That would be a significant competitive advantage and moat for MSFT to lean on due to the time investment of having to switch to a competing language and the first-mover advantage it presents for MSFT.\n\nQ# could very well become the .NET for quantum applications, a language that needs highly specialized developers to work in the field.\n\nMicrosoft has experience building these types of ecosystems before, and I believe it\u2019s capable of fostering a similar one with Q#. It\u2019s a possibility that investors should keep in mind.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Buffett Bot\u2019s Best Bets: 3 Top Stock Picks From a Warren-Trained AI Model",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is often hailed as one of the greatest investors, with a track record that has consistently outpaced the broader markets. Could artificial intelligence (AI) emulate his success? I recently discovered an intriguing AI model called the \u201cBuffett Bot\u201d that was trained to mimic Warren Buffett.\n\nAs AI continues making strides across industries, it\u2019s no surprise some clever developers have aimed these analytical engines at the financial markets. And basing one on the Oracle of Omaha himself seems like an especially smart play. Of course, this AI isn\u2019t the real Buffett, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how modern data science attempts to replicate legendary investors.\n\nI\u2019ll be taking a look at the stock picks recently put forward by this Buffett-inspired AI. The model imitates Buffett\u2019s penchant for finding strong yet reasonably-valued businesses. It will be intriguing to see what kind of companies and sectors the Buffett Bot highlights as solid investments. While this AI is unlikely to fully capture the depth of real-world experience and nuanced judgment behind Buffett\u2019s brilliance, it may still surface some appealing prospects. At the very least, its selections should provide thoughtful food for thought.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoody\u2019s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody\u2019s (NYSE:MCO) holds an enormously influential position in global finance as one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d credit ratings agencies alongside S&P (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch. This oligopoly enjoys durable competitive advantages from high barriers to entry and a sticky customer base. Thus, I\u2019m not surprised to see Buffett Bot tap Moody\u2019s as a smart Buffett-style bet.\n\nAfter all, the real Buffett also knows a thing or two about this industry leader \u2013 MCO occupies a sizable 2.6% allocation in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. For a man with a highly concentrated portfolio anchored by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), carving out such a large niche for Moody\u2019s signals conviction in its prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t Buffett have this conviction? Moody\u2019s just delivered another quarter of impressive growth in Q3 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, powered by strong performance across ratings and research, data and analytics, and M&A. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s EBITDA leapt 32%.\n\nNo doubt, Moody\u2019s trades at a steep premium. Its shares currently command a valuation of roughly 12-times forward sales and 39-times forward earnings. However, the company\u2019s growth prospects support these rich valuations. Analysts forecast annual earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next five years on the back of near double-digit revenue expansion. In an entrenched triopoly that\u2019s strategically expanding its presence across high-margin adjacencies, I believe Moody\u2019s warrants its above-average multiple.\n\nAs an added bonus: Moody\u2019s pays out a small but growing dividend that yields 0.8%. Moody\u2019s offers compelling total return potential as a Buffett-approved blue-chip with fortress positioning in an essential global industry. I agree with the Oracle and his digital doppelg\u00e4nger that this is a long-term winner.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management (BAM) bam international stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile not currently a Berkshire holding, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) aligns nicely with the Buffett school of thought. This alternative asset manager focuses on real assets like infrastructure, real estate, renewables, and private equity \u2013 tangible categories that benefit society. Its value-based approach centers on acquiring high-quality assets during times of distress or dislocation to generate strong risk-adjusted returns.\n\nIn other words, Brookfield brings a long-term lens to its investing framework, and is backed by a strong balance sheet \u2013 key \u201cBuffettesque\u201d principles. So, I understand why a digital version of the Oracle tapped Brookfield as an intriguing pick. As attention pivots toward renewable energy and infrastructure spending while real estate rebounds from pandemic lows, this is a company with plenty of tailwinds to consider.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth forecasts look promising, too. Brookfield anticipates 17% annualized sales growth over the next two years alongside 19% earnings growth in 2025. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times based on estimated 2024 earnings seems somewhat rich, I believe this premium makes sense for a company eyeing high-teens bottom-line boosts. Plus, shareholders get paid to wait via a 3.2% dividend yield that should keep growing.\n\nI agree with Buffett Bot that BAM stock warrants a spot in a long-term-focused portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Buffett largely missed the boat on new tech like AI over the years. But the small Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) position (recently trimmed) in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio proves that even old dogs can learn some new tricks. And while Buffett may not be ready to fully embrace fast-moving tech disruptors, his digital descendant shows more enthusiasm in tapping Amazon\u2019s immense potential.\n\nNow, AMZN stock trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares of the e-commerce giant currently trade for more than 82-times trailing earnings. But when you dominate the secular growth engines of e-commerce and cloud like Amazon does, lofty multiples feel warranted. Remember, AWS alone commands a 41.5% market share in the cloud, greater than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) combined!\n\nMeanwhile, early pandemic aftershocks to the e-commerce sector have settled, paving the way for growth re-acceleration. Over the last three years, Amazon\u2019s net sales grew outpaced over 84% of marketwide peers. And though its price-earnings ratio seems extremely rich for a company of this scale, it falls below Amazon\u2019s 5-year average near 120-times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +14.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 10.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +16.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. This estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.57 indicates a change of +5.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.63 billion and $66.53 billion estimates indicate +2.9% and +4.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nIBM reported revenues of $17.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $3.87 for the same period compares with $3.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.59%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nIBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "AI training initiative is first in new GSMA Advance series aims to build skills, foster innovation and champion workforce diversity\n\nLONDON and NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2024 /CNW/ -- The GSMA and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new collaboration to support the adoption and skills of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the telecom industry through the launch of GSMA Advance's AI Training program and the GSMA Foundry Generative AI program. IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)\n\nThe AI training program, the first in a new series of courses by GSMA Advance, seeks to prepare telco leaders for the AI-era and bridge skills gaps in the telecom industry, by equipping members with skills and knowledge to help effectively leverage Gen AI technologies utilizing watsonx, IBM's AI and data platform with AI assistants.\n\nThe training program, designed for telecoms leaders, will span a wide range of topics, from fundamental AI principles to specialized Gen AI applications in telecoms. To ensure a wide-range of participants can benefit, GSMA Advance AI Training sessions will take place at IBM offices in five locations around the world in 2024, including Dubai, London, Mexico, New York and Seoul, and an online training program will be available in multiple languages.\n\nA digital version of the program will be available to help address both the business strategy and technology fundamentals of Generative AI. This program will leverage IBM watsonx to deliver hands-on training designed to equip architects and developers with in-depth practical Gen AI knowledge.\n\nThe GSMA Foundry Generative AI program will provide GSMA members with\u00a0access to IBM's watsonx. This platform is intended to help telecom industry players explore innovative industry-specific use cases of Generative AI, enabling members to improve cost leadership, revenue growth and enhance customer experience. As part of the ongoing collaboration GSMA Foundry and IBM will drive a series of Gen AI industry programs and challenges to investigate the use of Generative AI in various functional areas of a telecom provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nBridging The AI Adoption Gap\n\nThrough both the GSMA Advance AI Training and Foundry Gen AI programs, the GSMA and IBM will help address the gap in AI skills, training and tools, supporting GSMA's commitment to operators of all sizes across the world.\n\nIBM's latest AI Adoption Index found 40% of telecoms surveyed are exploring or experimenting with generative AI, and 45% have accelerated the rollout of AI. Research from GSMA Intelligence also shows that while 56%\u00a0of operators surveyed are actively trialing generative AI solutions \u2013 at a rate higher than any other priority technology - adoption this is less prevalent amongst mid-sized and smaller operators surveyed.\n\nThrough this initiative, the GSMA and IBM aim to allow operators, including those supporting the world's least connected communities, to benefit from AI technology, and develop new innovative and inclusive solutions to help connect those in society who are not yet online.\n\nGenerative AI holds tremendous potential to help improve all manner of operations and customer engagement. Specifically, generative AI can help transform customer care, IT and network optimization \u2014all areas in which automation can notably help increase agility and efficiency. Through their commitment to developing generative AI skills and training for the telecom industry, the GSMA and IBM want to enable mobile operators to provide better services and, ultimately, help more people benefit from digital connectivity.\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence provides the telecoms industry, and the societies it serves, with huge opportunities to launch new services, improve connectivity and customer experience. Overall, it's estimated that AI could contribute $15.7 trillion1 to the global economy by 2030,\" said Alex\u00a0Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer at the GSMA. \"However, it's critical that AI is democratized to ensure that all parts of the connectivity industry and their customers, wherever they are in the world, benefit. Bringing operators access to AI tools and knowledge, alongside the necessary\u00a0skills, access and training, is key to achieving this.\"\n\n\"As a world leader in AI for business, IBM will provide critical support to this training for the telecom industry through this collaboration with the GSMA,\" said Stephen Rose, GM, Global Industries, IBM. \"Generative AI can create massive opportunities for communication service providers as they look to optimize current processes, and like the GSMA, our goal is to offer this technology within the industry, which we're making possible through watsonx.\"\n\nWith\u00a0Mobile World Congress around the corner, the GSMA will share more on the future of the program and additional initiatives to address the AI skills gap.

        "title": "3 Disruptive AI Stocks That Could Dominate the Market by 2027",
        "content": "In the AI space, three prominent companies stand poised to reshape the market by 2027. Each company, a titan in its domain, weaves strategies of disruption. They are charting a fundamental course that promises to redefine AI. This has led to this article on AI stocks to dominate.\n\nThe first one\u2019s meteoric rise, fueled by a strategic diversification strategy, showcases a company adept at meeting market demands. On the other hand, the second one demonstrates double-digit revenue growth and introduces game-changing products like GPT Copilots. The company elevates the standard for AI in customer relationship management. Meanwhile, the third one\u2019s digital experience business, propelled by its experience platform and cutting-edge solutions like GenStudio, focuses on staying ahead in the digital experience arena.\n\nThis article explores the heart of these companies\u2019 strategies. It analyzes the strategic threads that could lead them to dominate the AI market by 2027.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMD) data center segment is vital to market value growth. For instance, despite reporting flat year-over-year revenue, the sequential growth of 21% is vital in Q3 2023. This sequential uptick suggests a positive response to AMD\u2019s product offerings within the data center space. Also, the solid demand for 3rd- and 4th-generation EPYC processors boosted record quarterly server processor revenue. Notably, 4th Gen EPYC CPU revenue grew more than 50% sequentially.\n\nOn the other hand, the client segment, marked by a\u00a042% year-over-year revenue increase and a sequential growth of 46%, suggests AMD\u2019s robust performance in the consumer market. This significant growth reflects the strong demand for AMD\u2019s products and the progressive execution of its market strategies.\n\nMoreover, sales of\u00a0Ryzen 7000 processors featuring the Ryzen AI on-chip accelerator experienced substantial growth. This is driven by the normalization of inventory levels in the PC market and the return of demand to seasonal patterns, indicating a successful alignment of AMD\u2019s product offerings with market trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe profitability achieved in the client segment, with an operating income of\u00a010% of revenue, marks a turnaround from a year ago when the segment reported an operating loss. Hence, this shift reflects AMD\u2019s effective cost management and improved revenue streams in the consumer market. This makes it one of those AI stocks to dominate.\n\nDespite the challenges in the semi-custom space, gaming graphics revenue grew year-over-year and sequentially, driven by increased demand in the channel. Operating income of 14% of revenue in the gaming segment, compared to 9% a year ago, suggests improved profitability, driven by higher revenue from Radeon GPU sales. Overall, these developments suggest the importance of AMD\u2019s strategy to diversify its product portfolio and focus on high performance to edge out competition.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) Automated stock trading concept.

Trailblazing. trillion-dollar ai stocks\n\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) has solid top-and bottom-line growth that may continue to sustain over the long term. For instance, the company reported a progressive quarter and year, showcasing double-digit revenue growth and exceeding non-GAAP margins of 30% in Q3 fiscal 2024.\n\nThree main factors contribute to the excitement surrounding the recent quarter. Simultaneously, there is massive growth in liquidity, particularly the $1.5 billion in operating cash flow, which improved 389% year-over-year. Similarly, free cash flow boosted by 1,088% year-over-year.\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s an impressive\u00a080% growth in deals exceeding $1 million, surpassing expectations. The ability to integrate various cloud services like Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, Data Cloud, Sales Cloud, and Service Cloud into comprehensive solutions is a considerable achievement. Customer interest is resurgent in such integrated offerings after a downturn in fiscal 2023.\n\nSecondly, a new product, Data Cloud, is introduced, a major source of client engagement. The company gained 1K new Data Cloud customers in Q3. In particular, the product has a solid positive reception in Japan (the second-largest software market).\n\nThirdly, the introduction of Einstein GPT Copilots, a product that wasn\u2019t even imagined in fiscal 2023. This AI product has a combination of predictive and generative capabilities. It has seen rapid adoption, with\u00a017% of Fortune 100 companies becoming customers within a short time.\n\nFinally, Einstein\u2019s contribution suggests the scale and reliability of Salesforce\u2019s AI CRM platform. This includes over 49 billion product recommendations and over 53 billion marketing messages sent via the Marketing Cloud. Therefore, the large deals, Data Cloud, and Einstein GPT Copilots are fundamental drivers for the company\u2019s growth. All in all, it\u2019s one of those AI stocks to dominate.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe\u2019s (NASDAQ:ADBE) product momentum and top-line growth signifies the growth engine. For instance, in Q4 2023, the Digital Experience business achieved $1.27 billion, with subscription revenue at $1.12 billion, representing a considerable 12% year-over-year growth.\n\nA strong momentum is also noted with the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and native applications. This includes real-time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and customer journey analytics. AEP had its first $100 million quarter of net new business in Q4. It has exited 2023 with a greater than $700 million annualized book of business.\n\nAdditionally, the recent release of Adobe GenStudio as an end-to-end solution brings together applications across Creative Cloud, Express, and Experience Cloud with Firefly generative AI. There is notable interest from mega brands like Henkel (OTCMKTS:HENKY), Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), along with agencies like Publicis, Omnicom, and Havas, highlighting the solution\u2019s market positioning.\n\nFurthermore, key customer wins include Alshaya, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), EY, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Riyadh Air, Santander Brasil (NYSE:BSBR), Sony (NYSE:SONY), Southern Graphics, Unilever (NYSE:UL), and Vanguard. Hence, Adobe\u2019s recognition in over 25 categories in Gartner\u2019s (NYSE:IT) Critical Capabilities for Digital Experience Platforms confirms its leadership in the space.\n\nAt its core, the annual recurring revenue of Adobe\u2019s Digital Media business exited fiscal 2023 with over\u00a0$15 billion. Looking forward, the conservative outlook derives confidence in the value-growth potential. The guidance considers subscription pricing increases and generative AI features that attract new subscribers.\n\nLastly, Adobe\u2019s focus on delivering more value contributes significantly to digital media growth. Hence, the mix of subscription plans, including Creative Cloud All Apps, Single Apps, Stock, Express, and Firefly, drives top-line diversification. It\u2019s one of those AI stocks to dominate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 cheapest dividend aristocrat stocks to buy right now. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and the performance of dividend growers over the years, and go directly to read 5 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats Right Now.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are a group of companies that have a history of consistently increasing their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. Investors often view these stocks favorably because they are perceived as reliable income generators. The ability to consistently increase dividends over a long period is seen as a sign of financial strength and stability. In addition to this, these stocks have shown remarkable performance over the years, outperforming various other types of assets. As per a ProShares report citing data from Factset, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index exhibited an impressive return of 27.7% from March 2022 to April 2023. In comparison, the broader S&P 500, during the same timeframe, delivered a slightly lower return of 25.2%.\n\nThese stocks not only delivered impressive returns in the recent past but have consistently outperformed since the inception of the index in 2005, particularly highlighting the sustained success of dividend aristocrats. The ProShares report further mentioned that since its launch, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has consistently outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating reduced volatility and the potential to transform a $10,000 initial investment in May 2005 into over $61,000 by March 2023. The index boasts an impressive upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, indicating robust performance in both bullish and bearish market conditions. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent dividend aristocrat stocks among investors.\n\nIn the realm of dividend investing, a perpetual struggle exists between prioritizing high yields and emphasizing dividend growth. Investors hold divergent opinions on this matter, but analysts consistently advocate for companies exhibiting robust and consistent dividend growth. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist affiliated with Morningstar's Index team, has frequently expressed support for companies that consistently increase their dividends. In a recent report from the firm, the analyst said investing in dividend growth differs significantly from high-dividend investing. A portfolio focused on dividend growth indicates a company's strong competitive position and improving fortunes. Such a portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector exposures, growth and value characteristics, and metrics like price-to-earnings. While it may still lean towards value, a dividend growth portfolio is considered more balanced and core-oriented compared to a high-dividend portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nUndervalued dividend aristocrats also often attract significant attention and interest among investors.

        "content": "Earnings for the fourth and final quarter of 2023 continue to roll in. And, as is often the case, the results are a mixed bag.\n\nWhile many companies, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are posting big misses, other companies are surprising to the upside, sending their share prices higher as a result. In recent days, several notable companies have announced much stronger-than-expected financial results. This causes investors to take notice and sends analysts scrambling to revise their stock ratings and price targets. According to FactSet, with only 10% of S&P 500 companies having reported their Q4 2023 results so far, 62% have announced profit and sales surprises.\n\nMore can be expected in the coming weeks. Let\u2019s explore three such surprising stocks that are worthy of a double-take.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) are up 11%. It had its biggest one-day rise in years, after the technology giant posted fourth-quarter financial results that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\nIBM announced earnings per share (EPS) of $3.87 versus the analyst-expected $3.78. Revenue totaled $17.38 billion versus $17.30 billion that had been forecast. Sales rose 4% from a year ago, and free cash flow for all of 2023 totaled $11.20 billion. In fact, management had guided toward $10.50 billion.\n\nAdditionally, IBM\u2019s Q4 gross margin of 59.1% was the highest since 1999. The company said that its software revenue came in at $7.51 billion during Q4, up 3% from a year earlier. Consulting revenue grew 6% year over year (YOY) to $5.05 billion. Plus, IBM said its AI-related business was double the size it was in Q3 of last year. Looking ahead, IBM expects $12 billion in 2024 free cash flow and revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Also, IBM stock is now up 38% over the last 12 months.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport.

Its stock is up 8% after the company announced better-than-expected Q4 earnings and gave a bullish outlook for the year ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe airline posted Q4 2023 EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $13.10 billion. Wall Street had expected a profit of 11 cents on sales of $13 billion. Load factor, a key measure of an airline\u2019s passenger carrying capacity is utilized, was at 83.6% in Q4, besting forecasts of 82.9%.\n\nIn terms of guidance, AAL said it expects to report earnings of $2.25 to $3.25 a share for all of 2024. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had been calling for full-year earnings of $2.14 per share. American Airlines said that it is benefiting from continued strength in air travel coming out of the pandemic, including record bookings over the recent year-end holiday season. AAL stock is down 7% over the last 12 months. But now, it shows signs of a turnaround after the strong Q4 print.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) was doing well heading into earnings, and the company\u2019s Q4 print did not disappoint. ServiceNow reported better-than-expected results fueled by rising demand for AI products.\n\nThe software company, which specializes in workflow-management, reported EPS of $3.11. That number topped analyst expectations of $2.78.

        "title": "IBM to Managers: Move Near an Office or Leave Company",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. delivered a companywide ultimatum to managers who are still working remotely: move near an office or leave the company.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders Line Up for \u2018Once-in-a-Generation\u2019 Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff Evergrande Set for Liquidation as China Property Crisis Drags On\n\nAll US managers must immediately report to an office or client location at least three days a week \u201cregardless of current work location status,\u201d according to a memo sent on Jan. 16 viewed by Bloomberg. Badge-in data will be used to \u201cassess individual presence\u201d and shared with managers and human resources, Senior Vice President John Granger wrote in the note.\n\nThose working remotely, other than employees with exceptions such as medical issues or military service, who don\u2019t live close enough to commute to a facility must relocate near an IBM office by the start of August, according to the memo. That generally means within 50 miles (80 kilometers), according to a person familiar with the rule who asked not to be identified speaking about corporate policy.\n\nManagers who don\u2019t agree to relocate and are unable to secure a role that\u2019s approved to be remote must \u201cseparate from IBM,\u201d Granger wrote.\n\n\u201cIBM is focused on providing a work environment that balances flexibility with the face-to-face interactions that make us more productive, innovative and better able to serve our clients,\u201d a company spokesperson said. \u201cConsistent with that approach, we\u2019re requiring executives and people managers in the United States to be in the office at least three days per week.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Office Arvind Krishna has long touted the importance of in-person work. In a May 2023 interview with Bloomberg, Krishna said that promotions will be rarer for those who aren\u2019t on-site. Some teams within IBM had already instituted office attendance requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM has slimmed its operations to focus on software and services in recent years, introduced new products to capitalize on interest in artificial intelligence and divested its managed infrastructure, weather and health businesses. Executives gave a positive outlook for 2024 with fourth-quarter earnings last week, sending shares to their best day in almost four years.\n\nBig Blue expects to reduce jobs this year, spending a similar amount on restructuring as it did last year when it planned to cut 3,900 workers, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said last week. Return-to-office mandates are often seen as fueling attrition. IBM had about 288,000 workers globally at the end of 2022.\n\nThe company has closed a number of offices since the onset of the pandemic, potentially complicating return-to-office plans for workers. That includes in central New York State, Southbury, Connecticut, and Iowa. Reducing its real estate footprint is part of IBM\u2019s ongoing margin-expansion efforts, Kavanaugh said during an earnings call last week. It couldn\u2019t be determined how many managers would be required to move under the new rules.\n\nMany companies have increased return-to-office requirements over the last year replacing employee-friendly incentives like happy hours and commuter subsidies with more punitive measures including disciplinary action or limited career advancement if attendance targets aren\u2019t met. The tech industry in particular has seen tightening rules as the market soured and the risk of job cuts has tipped the scale in favor of employers. Amazon.com Inc. and AT&T Inc. have each ordered some remote workers to relocate near offices.\n\nDespite new rules, office attendance remained fairly stagnant throughout 2023, according to data from Kastle Systems. Across the 10 largest business districts in the US, the number of workers in the office hovered around 50% of what it was before the pandemic, with tech-heavy regions like the San Francisco Bay Area reporting even lower percentages.\n\n--With assistance from Matthew Boyle.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West\u2019s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa\u2019s Most Dramatic Turnaround\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2216570/should-you-quit-value-investing)\n\nShould You Quit Value Investing?\n\nWelcome to Episode #356 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\n(0:45) - Should You Continue To Buy Like A Value Investor? (8:10) - Finding Strong Tech Stocks On Sale: Tracey\u2019s Top Stock Picks (21:15) - Episode Roundup: DELL, SIMO, ZM, NTAP, IBM Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nGrowth stocks are at it again. The Magnificent 7 stocks, some of the world's largest companies, are seemingly hitting new highs nearly daily. The S&P 500, of which the Mag 7 now makes up 29%, has hit new highs 6 sessions in a row.\n\nMeanwhile, value stocks are mostly lagging. Banks, one of the cheapest industries, rallied to end 2023 but have been quiet in 2024 despite posting solid earnings reports. Energy, another cheap sector, under performed last year and has started off 2024 with more of the same.\n\nShould value investors quit value and dive into growth? Or should value investors seek out value stocks in the hot sectors, like technology?\n\nScreening for Cheap Tech Stocks\n\nTracey did a basic screen to look for cheap value stocks. Using the Zacks.com stock screening tool, she added the Computer and Technology Sector, the Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), which are the top Zacks ranks, and a forward P/E of 20 or less.\n\nThis screen returned 37 stocks.\n\nWhat was on the list? Many hardware technology companies, which tend to be cheaper than software.\n\n5 Cheap Tech Stocks with High Zacks Rank\n\n1. Dell Technologies Inc. DELL\n\nStory continues\n\nDell is a large cap tech company, with a market cap of $58.6 billion. Shares of Dell have soared 104% in the last year, but it is still cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 12.4.\n\nDell pays a dividend, yielding 1.8%. It's a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nAfter the big rally, is it too late to consider buying Dell?\n\n2. International Business Machines Corp. IBM\n\nIBM is a large cap tech company, with a market cap of $173 billion. Shares are up 23% in the last year.\n\nIBM is trading under 20x, but it's not that cheap at 17.7x. Investors have always liked IBM for its big dividend, currently yielding 3.8%.\n\nIBM is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nShould value investors be considering IBM?\n\n3. Silicon Motion Technology Corp. SIMO\n\nSilicon Motion is a small cap, with a market cap of $2.1 billion. Shares have struggled over the last year, and are down 5% during that time.\n\nSilicon Motion isn't dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 19.3. But it does pay an attractive dividend, currently yielding 3.1%. Silicon Motion is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nShould Silicon Motion be on your short list?\n\n4. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. ZM\n\nZoom Video is a big cap with a market cap of $20.5 billion. Shares have struggled over the last year, and are down 0.6% during that time.\n\nZoom Video is cheap, with a forward P/E of 14. It does not pay a dividend. Zoom Video is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nIs Zoom Video on sale in 2024?\n\n5. NetApp, Inc. NTAP\n\nNetApp is a mid-cap company with a market cap of $18.4 billion.

        "title": "Could IBM Become the Next Microsoft?",
        "content": "IBM's (NYSE: IBM) stock price rallied 9% to an 11-year high on Jan. 25 after the tech giant posted its fourth-quarter earnings report. Its revenue rose 4% year over year to $17.4 billion, which exceeded analysts' estimates by $100 million. Its adjusted earnings grew 8% to $3.87 per share and also cleared the consensus forecast by $0.07 per share.\n\nThat earnings beat suggests that IBM's turnaround efforts under CEO Arvind Krishna, who took the helm in April 2020, are finally bearing fruit. But can Big Blue ever fully reinvent itself like Microsoft, which became a high-growth tech giant again over the past decade as it expanded its cloud-based ecosystem? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did IBM need a turnaround plan?\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, IBM's annual revenue decreased from $99.9 billion to $55.2 billion. That persistent decline was caused by two major mistakes.\n\nFirst, IBM's core business software, IT infrastructure, and mainframe divisions struggled as more companies shifted toward cloud-based services. Second, it divested many of its lower-margin segments, which reduced its total revenue.\n\nStreamlining its sprawling business initially seemed like the right move, but it plowed most of its cash from its divestments into wasteful share buybacks instead of making meaningful investments in its own cloud ecosystem. By the time IBM finally started focusing on the cloud, it had already lost the public cloud platform market to Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google.\n\nThose missteps caused many investors, including Warren Buffett, to abandon IBM. From the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2020, its stock declined 4% as the S&P 500 advanced 237%. Even after factoring in reinvested dividends, IBM only delivered a total return of 38% compared to the S&P 500's total return of 322%.\n\nHow is Krishna trying to turn around IBM?\n\nArvind Krishna and Microsoft's Satya Nadella both led their companies' cloud divisions prior to taking on their CEO roles. That's why it wasn't surprising when Krishna, like Nadella, immediately prioritized the expansion of IBM's cloud business.\n\nStory continues\n\nKrishna's first big move was the divestment of its slower-growth managed infrastructure services unit. Kyndryl spun off in November 2021, enabling IBM to focus on expanding its higher-growth hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) businesses.\n\nRealizing that IBM couldn't go head-to-head against Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in the public cloud, Krishna prioritized the development of hybrid cloud services that could process the data that flowed between private and public clouds. The crux of that strategy is its Red Hat subsidiary, which develops open-source software for a wide range of computing platforms. The expansion of that hybrid cloud should also support its development of AI tools for processing all of that data.\n\nWill that turnaround lead to bigger gains for IBM?\n\nAt the end of 2021, IBM restructured its business into three simpler reporting segments -- software, consulting, and infrastructure -- and set a goal of generating \"sustainable mid-single digit revenue growth\" from 2022 to 2024. At the time, it expected the mid-single-digit growth of its software business and the high-single-digit expansion of its consulting segment to offset the \"flat\" growth of its infrastructure division.\n\nSegment 2022 Revenue Growth 2023 Revenue Growth Software 7% 5% Consulting 7% 5% Infrastructure 8% (5%) Total revenue 6% 2%\n\nData source: IBM.\n\nIBM easily cleared those targets in 2022, but the slower-than-expected expansion of its consulting and infrastructure divisions throttled its growth throughout 2023. But most of that deceleration occurred in the first half of the year, and its growth accelerated again in the second half as its consulting and infrastructure businesses recovered.\n\nFor 2024, it expects its revenue to rise by the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis, with currency headwinds reducing its reported revenue by a single percentage point. That's in line with analysts' expectations for 3% growth.\n\nBut can IBM pull off a Microsoft-like turnaround?\n\nIBM's prospects are brightening, its stock still looks cheap at 19 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward yield of 3.8%. For value investors, it might look more appealing than Microsoft, which trades at 37 times forward earnings and pays a paltry forward yield of 0.7%. But Microsoft is also growing a lot faster than IBM: Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both rise 15% this year as it expands its cloud and AI businesses.\n\nTherefore, I think it's premature to call IBM the next Microsoft. A few green shoots are appearing, but IBM is still trying to carve out a defensible niche with its newest cloud and AI services, while Microsoft remains a clear leader in both markets. IBM could stabilize its aging business with single-digit revenue growth over the next few years, but it shouldn't be seriously compared to Microsoft until it fires up a few more growth engines.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 states with highest average salary in America. We have also discussed some statistics related to the US economy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States with Highest Average Salary in America.\n\nSince around 1890, the United States has held the position of the world's largest economy by nominal measures. With a gross domestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion, the US economy constitutes over 15% of the global gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP). The average gross annual wage per full-time employee in the USA was $74,738 in 2021, or around $6,228 per month.\n\nMoreover, the average salary in the US is $59,428 annually whereas the per capita income in the United States over the past 12 months, adjusted for inflation to 2022 dollars, was $41,261. In 2022, the real median household income in the USA experienced a 2.3% decline, dropping to $74,580 from the 2021 estimate of $76,330.\n\nWalmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is set to raise the average salary for its US store managers, effective February 1, 2024. The pay-increase will increase the average annual salary from $117,000 to $128,000. Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) will offer a bonus of up to 200% of base pay to store managers.\n\nApproximately 75% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u2019s field management teams, like store managers, began their careers in hourly roles. The salary adjustments will impact managers across different pay ranges, with those at the lowest end seeing the largest increases, from $65,000 to $90,000, while those at the top end will remain at $170,000. The changes in pay align with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) ongoing efforts to increase starting wages, bringing the US average hourly wage to over $18 soon. These adjustments could potentially enhance Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) recruitment and retention strategies in the competitive job market.\n\nIn 2023, the US economy exhibited unexpected strength by adding 216,000 jobs, surpassing economists' forecast of 175,000. However, this positive momentum was tempered by downward revisions of 70,000 to job gains in October and November. Despite the stable performance, overall job growth in 2023 slowed, with 2.7 million jobs added at a monthly rate of 225,000, down from 4.8 million and 399,000 in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile certain industries, like government, health care, and social assistance, continue to drive job gains, others, including trucking and professional services, are lagging. Notably, wage-growth did accelerate, with average hourly pay rising to $34.27 and a yearly increase of 4.1%, slightly above the Fed's target. However, the labor force participation rate declined to 62.5%, marking the biggest drop in nearly three years, potentially complicating the Fed's task of managing inflation. As the job market is anticipated to cool further in 2024, the rise in wage growth and decrease in participation may influence the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period.\n\nSpeaking of wage growth, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) has announced major benefits for its hourly employees in 2024, with a minimum 3% pay raise (4-5% based on tenure), scheduling improvements, and career mobility opportunities. These changes have come amid the company's ongoing legal battles with Workers United and efforts to enhance the employee experience before potential unionization. The benefits rollout includes pay raises effective January 1, 2024, with additional perks such as the first-ever Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX)\u00a0 Barista championships (Feb.-June 2024) and an announcement of a new Siren credit card. However, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) Workers United have still expressed dissatisfaction, claiming the company is implementing these benefits in nonunion stores while denying them to unionizing or unionized locations, prompting the union to file an unfair labor charge.\n\nOwing to the rising inflation, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is set to increase its cloud services costs by up to 26% starting January 2024, affecting infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services. The price hike will impact international customers more than their US counterparts. PaaS services which includes International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s Kubernetes Services and RedHat OpenShift, will see a 3% global increase. For IaaS offerings, bare metal servers, virtual server instances, file and block storage, and networking infrastructure will be affected. The price changes vary across international data centers, with the steepest increase at Sao Paulo, Brazil, at 7.5%.\n\nSpeaking of International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM), the company is set to report its Q4 2023 results on January 24, with expectations of around $17.3 billion in revenue and earnings per share close to $3.76. Key drivers for International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s growth in the quarter are anticipated to be its core software operations, particularly with the growth in sales of Red Hat products and Data & AI solutions. Despite challenges in the IT spending market, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s consulting business has performed well, witnessing a 6% year-over-year increase in Q3 sales. However, the infrastructure front might face challenges as demand for International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) mainframe computers could be impacted by weaker investments by large corporations amid high inflation and a mixed macroeconomic outlook. 25 States with Highest Average Salary in America\n\nCopyright: sifotography / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nBased on comprehensive data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we present a list of average salaries in the 25 states in US.

Hawaiian Electric Industries that provide 95% of electricity comes with high prices which are nearly three times the national average.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 25 best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.\n\nWhen considering investments in dividends, the focus naturally shifts towards companies that consistently increase their dividend payouts. These stocks provide investors with a reliable and steadily growing income over time. Additionally, they have demonstrated resilience during economic challenges. As per a Hartford Funds report, companies that have increased or introduced dividends have consistently outperformed other stocks since 1973, especially when compared to those that reduced or eliminated their dividends. Notably, these dividend-paying stocks have exhibited higher returns with considerably lower volatility. This is why many financial experts are currently emphasizing the advantages of integrating dividend-paying stocks as a fundamental component of an equity portfolio when advising their clients.\n\nA key driver behind the trend of companies initiating dividends lies in the aftermath of the financial crisis, where corporations experienced a surge in profits, leading to substantial growth in their balance sheets. Since the early 2000s, the cash reserves on corporate balance sheets have more than tripled. This surplus of cash provides corporations with versatile options, including expanding their operations or engaging in acquisitions. A notable choice for many companies has been to deploy the excess cash by either initiating a dividend program or augmenting existing dividend payouts. This strategic use of accumulated funds reflects a proactive approach by companies to enhance shareholder value and leverage their financial strength for sustained growth.\n\nTwo promising factors for dividend investors are the combination of strong corporate profits among S&P 500 companies and remarkably low payout ratios. According to a report by Hartford Funds, the historical average dividend payout ratio spanning 96 years has been 56.3%. However, as of December 31, 2022, the current payout ratio stands at a mere 37.1%, signifying a substantial gap with ample room for expansion. This presents a promising scenario for dividend investors, as companies appear to have considerable capacity to increase their dividend payouts, potentially leading to enhanced returns for investors in the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks faced a period of underperformance as yields experienced a significant increase, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. However, the outlook for income investing is anticipated to undergo a shift in 2024. With growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to either pause the rate hikes or potentially implement a cut, the dynamics of income investing are poised for a potential transformation. Portfolio Manager John Baldi, overseeing the ClearBridge Dividend Strategy, has expressed an optimistic perspective on dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cAs a general overall market observation, the macro is highly unpredictable. We entered 2023 with expectations for a recession that was going to start in the back half of this year. We\u2019ve just reported one of the strongest quarters of growth in the recent past. With highly unpredictable macro as a backdrop, I think it\u2019s important to maintain equity exposure. One of the better ways to maintain equity exposure, in our opinion, is a simple framework of investing in dividend-paying stocks.\u201d\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the best dividend growth stocks that have grabbed investors\u2019 attention.

        "title": "IBM's Artificial-Intelligence Business Is Booming",
        "content": "International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), a company that has been largely written off by investors over the past decade, is having a moment. A yearslong transformation effort has rejiggered the company's portfolio, aligning it on two priorities: Hybrid cloud computing and artificial intelligence. In both areas, IBM's strength lies in its ability to offer full-scale solutions to its enterprise clients.\n\nAI is still a small business for IBM, but it's growing incredibly fast. The company's secret weapon is its consulting business. \"Consulting is a core driver of our value proposition for clients,\" said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in the fourth-quarter earnings call. IBM provides an AI software platform called watsonx that enables its clients to train, deploy, and manage AI models, but it's the guidance and implementation expertise provided by the company's consulting arm that's closing deals.\n\nSoaring demand for generative AI\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, IBM's book of business related to generative AI and watsonx was in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. This isn't revenue, but instead the amount that clients are committing to spend. That amount doubled in the fourth quarter. Software drove just one-third of this business, with consulting signings driving the remaining two-thirds. Clearly, the consulting arm is doing the heavy lifting.\n\nThis makes sense. Large enterprises have complex requirements when it comes to AI, so adopting generative AI technology is not a cut-and-dried process. One example IBM gave during its fourth-quarter earnings call was a pilot with banking giant Citigroup that involved the watsonx code assistant.\n\nIBM's mainframe systems are still prolific in certain industries, including banking. Much of the mission-critical code running on these systems is written in an ancient programming language called COBOL. The problem is that no one really learns COBOL anymore. As time goes on, the pool of developers capable of maintaining these COBOL applications dwindles.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM introduced an AI tool called watsonx code assistant last year that aims to solve this problem for its clients. The tool uses generative AI to map out a COBOL application, split it up into parts, and convert it to a more modern programming language. The most advanced large language models available publicly are capable of writing code, but a company like Citi certainly isn't going to send ChatGPT critical, sensitive banking code. Instead, it needs a secure AI platform that it can trust, along with guidance and expertise to make the best use of it. That's the IBM AI value proposition in a nutshell.\n\nBuy this AI stock now\n\nIBM has a clear AI strategy that leverages its AI software platform and its consulting arm to help clients adopt the revolutionary technology. The revenue contribution from AI is still small, and it will take time for the commitments from clients to convert to actual sales. But in the long run, AI can turn into a multi-billion dollar business for IBM.\n\nGartner predicts that global spending on AI software alone will approach $300 billion by 2027, with generative AI software accounting for more than one-third of that total. IBM's opportunity is even bigger than that, though, since it also offers consulting services around AI. As enterprises race to adopt this technology, IBM offers solutions, not just point products.\n\nEven after a post-earnings surge, IBM stock remains inexpensive. With a market capitalization that's approaching $170 billion and guidance calling for free cash flow of $12 billion this year, the stock trades at a price-to-free cash flow ratio of about 14. As the AI business scales, IBM's revenue growth could accelerate from the mid-single-digit growth it expects for 2024.\n\nWith an enterprise AI software platform paired with its vast consulting arm, IBM is in a unique position to win AI business from enterprise clients.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft seen as a 'clear-cut winner in AI', AMD upgraded",
        "content": "Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analsyt comments.\n\nMicrosoft seen as a \u2018clear-cut winner in AI\u2019\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held a developer AI tour event in New York City last week and analysts were once again impressed by the company\u2019s advance on the AI front.\n\nFor Barclays, the event was another piece of evidence that \u201cMicrosoft is a clear-cut winner in AI and has lots of runway to further monetize new and existing products.\u201d\n\n\u201c[We] came away incrementally positive on the progress Microsoft is making in its AI offerings\u2026 While today's event did not feature any new announcements, the strong developer turnout (>3,000 attendees), as well as interest in a variety of Microsoft products (both Copilot and others) demonstrated to us that Microsoft is capturing incremental mind share amongst enterprise customers,\u201d Barclays analysts said.\n\nCan AI rally continue to drive the overall market higher?\n\nWolfe Research strategists weighed in on the most powerful stocks theme at the moment \u2013 AI. Their analysis shows that six prominent large-cap companies, poised to reap significant benefits from AI advancements, have collectively contributed +210 basis points (bps) to the S&P 500's year-to-date return of +268 bps.\n\nWithin the industry landscape, Semiconductors have stood out as the top-performing group. Companies positioned as major beneficiaries of AI advancements within this sector are anticipated to experience substantial additional advantages in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWhile expectations appear to be very high, our sense is that the biggest AI beneficiaries are likely to outperform until AI-related earnings expectations start to turn downward. In our view, this is unlikely to occur unless a broad-based recession starts to hit at some point in the months ahead,\u201d strategists said in a note.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat said, the bigger question is whether the \u201cAI frenzy\u201d can keep powering the overall market higher. While AI should remain a tailwind, our sense is that the overall Fed liquidity picture, the interest rate outlook, and how much the U.S. economy slows in the months ahead will be bigger drivers of overall market returns.\u201d\n\nCiti\u2019s CIO survey\n\nCiti's 4Q Chief Information Officer (CIO) survey results indicated a significant improvement in the IT budget landscape. Expectations for near-term IT budget growth have increased from +1.9% in the September '23 survey to +2.8% in the December quarter, approaching the historical average of 3%.\n\nCybersecurity retains its position as the top investment priority for CIOs, followed by Data modernization/GenAI, Digital Transformation Projects, and Cloud Adoption. The global economic outlook appears stable to slightly improving, with upward revisions noted in trailing 3-month IT budgets. Sector-specific takeaways cover Software, European Technology, Hardware, Communication Services and Infrastructure, and IT Service.\n\n\u201cMSFT remains the top vendor that CIOs are considering as a GenAI partner, far ahead of GOOGL and AMZN. In terms of the breakdown of funding for GenAI projects, 64% of CIOs expect to get new/additional funding while 36% believe it will come from existing resources, with some CIOs expecting to spend less on vendors such as ORCL, IBM (NYSE:IBM) or SAP to make room for GenAI investments,\u201d analysts wrote in a note.\n\nSamsung offers a 'very cheap' way to participate in edge AI\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley urged the broker\u2019s clients to consider owning Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) shares, as the company offers \"one of the best ways\u201d to play a shift to consumer AI.\n\nThe analysts argued that AI is \"going to be a growth driver for years to come.\"\n\n\"We estimate double the DRAM content in AI PCs and a >50% rise in the next iteration of AI phones; along with replacement demand, this could drive 6ppt lower DRAM self-sufficiency by 2025,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in the note.\n\n\"The turn of the memory cycles provides a big boost to earnings estimates,\" added the analysts. \"Ultimately, Samsung is a very cheap way to participate in edge AI.\"\n\nAMD raised to Buy\n\nNew Street Research analysts raised their rating on the shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) to Buy with a $215 per share price target.\n\nThe broker\u2019s analysis shows upside for all names in the data center AI chip sector, with AMD and TSMC standing out at each end of the risk spectrum.\n\n\"Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, pitched late last year a target addressable market for datacenter AI chips of $400bn. Lisa is to be taken seriously; this forecast might eventually prove wrong, but it was certainly not pulled out of a hat,\" the analysts said.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft seen as a 'clear-cut winner in AI', AMD upgraded\n\nJulius Baer set to announce writeoff linked to Signa exposure - SonntagsZeitung\n\nHolcim To List North American Business",
