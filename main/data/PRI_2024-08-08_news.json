        "title": "Primerica (PRI) Tops Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Primerica (PRI) came out with quarterly earnings of $4.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.45 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.99 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.84%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this life insurance and financial products company would post earnings of $4.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.91, delivering a surprise of -4.87%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nPrimerica , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry, posted revenues of $753.29 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $689.57 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPrimerica shares have added about 17.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Primerica?\n\nWhile Primerica has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Primerica: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.64 on $755.54 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $17.73 on $3.01 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Life Insurance is currently in the bottom 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, GoHealth (GOCO), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 8.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $2.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -39.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nGoHealth's revenues are expected to be $140.66 million, down 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Primerica Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results",
        "content": "New life licenses up 14%, driving sales force to record 145,789 representatives\n\nTerm Life net premiums increased 4%; adjusted direct premiums increased 5%\n\nIssued Term Life face amount of $33 billion; total in force coverage of $951 billion\n\nInvestment and Savings Products sales of $3.1 billion, up 29%\n\nInvestment and Savings Products client asset values up 15%, ending the quarter at record $105 billion\n\nGAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.03; diluted adjusted operating earnings per share of $4.71\n\nDeclared a 20% increase in dividend to $0.90 per share, payable on September 12, 2024; repurchased $143 million of common stock during the quarter\n\nDULUTH, Ga., August 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company\u2019s previously announced decision to exit the Senior Health business and associated write-offs of non-cash items impacted GAAP earnings with net income ending at $1.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. Core business results from the quarter were strong. Adjusted net operating income of $162.7 million increased 12%, while adjusted operating earnings per diluted share of $4.71 grew 18% year-over-year. Total revenue of $803.4 million, which included $50 million in proceeds from payments under an insurance claim, increased 17% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating revenue of $753.3 million increased 9% year-over-year.\n\nThe Company\u2019s decision to exit the Senior Health business led to several non-cash adjustments in the second quarter of 2024. These included write-offs of the remaining goodwill and intangibles and the recognition of a tax benefit from the removal of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the intangible assets and a valuation allowance for state net operating losses. The quarter\u2019s results also included income recognized from the receipt of cash proceeds paid under a previously disclosed insurance claim. The Company excluded these non-recurring items from adjusted operating results to provide a comparable basis to the prior period results. A reconciliation of these items to GAAP results is included in the tables at the end of this release.\n\nSecond quarter operating results were driven by strong sales of investment products and rising client asset values as well as steady premium growth and the predictable margins of the Term Life business. Investment income benefited from higher yielding investments and growth in the Company\u2019s invested asset portfolio. Results were partially offset by weakness in the Senior Health business. Distribution results were strong during the quarter, driven by recruiting and growth in new life-licensed representatives.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I am pleased with the continued momentum of our business and the ongoing efforts of our sales force to educate clients and help them navigate these uncertain times,\" said Glenn Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Primerica, Inc. \"We welcomed nearly 40,000 teammates during our international convention in July and believe the event will build momentum for the future.\"\n\nSecond Quarter Distribution & Segment Results Distribution Results Q2 2024 Q2 2023 % Change Life-Licensed Sales Force 145,789 137,806 6 % Recruits 96,563 86,124 12 % New Life-Licensed Representatives 14,402 12,638 14 % Life Insurance Policies Issued 100,768 96,953 4 % Life Productivity (1) 0.23 0.24 * Issued Term Life Face Amount ($ billions) (2) $ 33.2 $ 32.2 3 % ISP Product Sales ($ billions) $ 3.1 $ 2.4 29 % Average Client Asset Values ($ billions) $ 103.0 $ 88.8 16 % Senior Health Submitted Policies (3) 15,767 13,885 14 % Senior Health Approved Policies (4) 14,646 12,915 13 % Closed U.S. Mortgage Volume ($ million brokered) $ 99.6 $ 82.2 21 %\n\n_______________________ (1) Life productivity equals the average monthly policies issued divided by the average number of life insurance licensed representatives.

The appeal of Primerica\u2019s business opportunity continued to generate significant interest. The Company recruited a total of 96,563 individuals, a 12% increase compared to the prior year period. Licensing remained similarly strong with a total of 14,402 new life licenses during the quarter, a 14% increase compared to the prior year period, fueling 6% growth in the size of the sales force year-over-year to 145,789 life-licensed representatives.\n\nTerm Life Insurance\n\nLife insurance policies issued during the second quarter increased 4% to 100,768, helping drive $33.2 billion in new term life face amount issued during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Productivity was at the higher end of the historical range at a monthly average of 0.23 policies issued per life-licensed representative. We believe higher cost of living pressures continued to impact middle-income families, contributing to elevated lapse rates during the quarter.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Term Life revenues of $426.9 million increased 4% compared to the second quarter of 2023 driven by 5% growth in adjusted direct premiums, while pre-tax operating income of $147.8 million increased 5%. The benefits and claims ratio of 57.4% benefited from a $4.3 million remeasurement gain largely due to better than anticipated claims experience. The DAC amortization and insurance commissions ratio of 11.8% remained stable year-over-year. The Term Life operating margin was 23.1%, in line with the prior year period.\n\nInvestment and Savings Products\n\nTotal product sales during the quarter were $3.1 billion, increasing 29% compared to the prior year period, driven by the strong demand for mutual funds, annuities and managed accounts. On June 30, 2024, client asset values were $105 billion, up 15% year-over-year primarily due to strong equity market appreciation. Net client inflows were $423 million during the quarter.\n\nSecond quarter ISP revenues of $260.9 million increased 22% compared to the prior year period, while pre-tax operating income of $74.8 million increased 26% due to strong sales and an increase in average client asset values. Revenues from sales-based commissions and fees increased 35%, rising at a slightly higher rate than sales due to a favorable mix shift. Sales-based commission expenses increased 31%, in line with the increase in correlated sales. Asset-based revenues increased 17%, largely consistent with the growth in average client asset values. The change in asset-based commission expenses was in line with asset-based revenues, excluding revenues on Canadian segregated funds. Expenses related to Canadian segregated funds are reflected in insurance commissions and amortization of DAC.\n\nSenior Health\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, a total of 14,646 policies were approved by carriers, representing a 13% increase compared to the prior year period. The lifetime value of commissions per approved policy (\"LTV\") was $914, while contract acquisition costs per approved policy (\"CAC\") were $1,074 for a LTV/CAC ratio of 0.9.\n\nSecond quarter Senior Health revenues were $12.4 million, including a $1.8 million negative tail revenue adjustment due to higher policy churn. The adjusted operating loss during the quarter was $11.4 million, driven by higher contract acquisition costs, which rose 25% as e-TeleQuote onboarded agents in preparation for the upcoming enrollment period.\n\nCorporate and Other Distributed Products\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the segment recorded pre-tax adjusted operating income of $0.9 million compared to a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $3.6 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the continued benefit of higher interest rates and growth in the size of the invested asset portfolio, which added an additional $5.0 million of adjusted net investment income to current quarter revenues.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe effective tax rate was 85.0% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 23.5% in the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate during the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the non-cash goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for income tax purposes and a valuation allowance established against e-TeleQuote\u2019s state net operating losses. The impact of those two items was partially offset by the representation and warranty insurance proceeds, which will be excluded from taxable income, and the write-off of deferred tax liabilities on the intangibles that were fully impaired in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the four aforementioned items, the effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2024 would have been 23.3%.\n\nCapital\n\nThe Company repurchased 629,378 shares of common stock for $142.7 million during the second quarter of 2024 and the Board of Directors has approved a 20% increase in the dividend to $0.90 per share, payable on September 12, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 21, 2024. Primerica Life Insurance Company\u2019s statutory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio was estimated to be about 445% as of June 30, 2024.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company presents certain non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, the Company presents adjusted direct premiums, other ceded premiums, adjusted operating revenues, adjusted operating income before income taxes, adjusted net operating income, and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share.\n\nAdjusted direct premiums and other ceded premiums are net of amounts ceded under coinsurance transactions that were executed concurrent with our initial public offering (the \"IPO coinsurance transactions\") for all periods presented. We exclude amounts ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions in measuring adjusted direct premiums and other ceded premiums to present meaningful comparisons of the actual premiums economically maintained by the Company. Amounts ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions will continue to decline over time as policies terminate within this block of business.\n\nAdjusted operating revenues, adjusted operating income before income taxes, adjusted net operating income and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share exclude the impact of investment gains (losses), including credit impairments, and fair value mark-to-market (\"MTM\") investment adjustments for all periods presented. We exclude investment gains (losses), including credit impairments, and MTM investment adjustments in measuring these non-GAAP financial measures to eliminate period-over-period fluctuations that may obscure comparisons of operating results due to items such as the timing of recognizing gains (losses) and market pricing variations prior to an invested asset\u2019s maturity or sale that are not directly associated with the Company\u2019s insurance operations. Also excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is the receipt of insurance proceeds under a Representation and Warranty policy negotiated and purchased in connection with the acquisition of e-TeleQuote. We exclude this gain from our non-GAAP financial measures as it represents a non-recurring item that causes incomparability in the Company\u2019s results.\n\nAdjusted operating income before taxes, adjusted net operating income, and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share also exclude non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges as non-recurring items that cause incomparability between period-over-period results. Also excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is restructuring and related charges incurred with the exit of our senior health business. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures as they are not useful in evaluating the Company\u2019s ongoing operations. Adjusted net operating income and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share also exclude the tax effect of pre-tax operating adjustments, the deferred tax benefit recognized in association with the impairment of intangible assets and the valuation allowance recognized for state operating losses in the Company\u2019s Senior Health segment. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP financial measures as they represent the tax effect of pre-tax operating adjustments and/or non-recurring items that will cause incomparability between period-over-period results.\n\nOur definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of similar measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance. Furthermore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of the core ongoing business. These measures have limitations and users should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are attached to this release.\n\nEarnings Webcast Information\n\nPrimerica will hold a webcast on Thursday, August 8, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern, to discuss the quarter\u2019s results.

        "title": "Primerica (PRI) Q2 Earnings on the Horizon: Analysts' Insights on Key Performance Measures",
        "content": "In its upcoming report, Primerica (PRI) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $4.45 per share, reflecting an increase of 11.5% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $747.42 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.4%.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 0.1% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Primerica metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Net investment income' to come in at $36.48 million. The estimate suggests a change of +12.6% year over year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenues- Commissions and fees' will reach $262.30 million. The estimate suggests a change of +12.5% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- Other, net' will reach $18.55 million. The estimate points to a change of -8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenues- Net premiums' to reach $428.99 million. The estimate points to a change of +6.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Investment and Savings Products' will likely reach $242.88 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.2%.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Corporate and Other Distributed Products' will reach $51.81 million. The estimate suggests a change of +7.3% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Term Life Insurance' should come in at $435.85 million. The estimate points to a change of +5.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Senior Health' reaching $13.31 million. The estimate points to a change of -10.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Recruits' stands at 92,458. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 86,124 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Life Insurance Policies Issued' of 98,839. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 96,953.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Life-Licensed Sales Force, End of period' at 145,713. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 137,806 in the same quarter last year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Adjusted Operating Income (loss) before income taxes- Investment and Savings Products' should arrive at $66.28 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $59.58 million.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Primerica here>>>\r\n\r\nPrimerica shares have witnessed a change of +6% in the past month, in contrast to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% move.

        "title": "Primerica (PRI) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Primerica (PRI) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 7. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis life insurance and financial products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $747.42 million, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.13% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Primerica?\n\nFor Primerica, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.74%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Primerica will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Primerica would post earnings of $4.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.91, delivering a surprise of -4.87%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nPrimerica doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122: Purchasing Power for Middle-Income Families Rose for Second Consecutive Month as Gas and Food Prices Declined",
        "content": "Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 - In June 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.0%, up from 100.3% in May 2024. This marks the second consecutive month purchasing power rose for middle-income families. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nModest improvements in spending power a positive sign, yet financial recovery still underway\n\nDULUTH, Ga., July 31, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, announced today the release of the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122), a monthly index illustrating the purchasing power of middle-income households with income between $30,000 and $130,000. In June 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.0%, up from 100.3% in May 2024. This marks the second consecutive month purchasing power rose for middle-income families. Declining gas and food prices while incomes continue to rise are the primary drivers for the modest improvements in spending power.\n\n\"Although the HBI\u2122 has been running above 100% since November, middle-income households have made little headway in making up for the run of high inflation,\" said Amy Crews Cutts, economic consultant to Primerica. \"In total, earned incomes have exceeded the rise in necessity goods by about $45, barely making a dent in the deep hole created by the 2021 to 2023 inflation period.\"\n\nFor more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122, visit www.householdbudgetindex.com.\n\nAbout the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122)\n\nThe Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE\u00ae. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\nThe HBI\u2122 is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI\u2122 uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent \"normal\" economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeriodically, prior HBI\u2122 values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI\u2122 data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI\u2122 data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Life Insurance Industry",
        "content": "Redesigning and repricing of products and services to maintain sales and profitability have been driving Zacks Life Insurance industry players. Life insurers are the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment as they invest a large portion of their premiums. Increased automation is expected to drive premium growth and boost the efficiency of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated RGA, Primerica PRI, Voya Financial VOYA, Lincoln National Corporation LNC and Brighthouse Financial BHF.\u00a0 However, with accelerated digitalization, expenses are likely to increase. Also, prudently pricing the products and balancing customers' preferences and claim costs are a challenge.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Life Insurance industry comprises companies that offer life insurance coverages and retirement benefits to individuals and groups. The products include annuities, whole and term life insurance, accidental death insurance, health insurance, Medicare supplements and long-term healthcare policies. Sales benefit from the increasing demand for protection products. The industry also includes companies providing wealth and asset management solutions. With a rise in the number of baby boomers, the demand for retirement benefits is increasing. Economic growth instills confidence. Per a Statista report, the life insurance market is expected to grow, with a gross written premium expected to be $3.67 trillion in 2024. The industry has also been witnessing the accelerated adoption of technology. However, rising mortality or loss cost trends may impact the profitability of insurers.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Life Insurance Industry\n\nAn Improved Rate Environment: An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate-sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity and competitiveness positively. In times of persistently low interest rates, life insurers' income from investments becomes insufficient to meet the contractually guaranteed obligations of policyholders, which cannot be lowered.\u00a0 Thus, they direct their funds into alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds and real estate, among others, to counter the challenge. The Fed has made 11 rate hikes since March 2022. Life insurers, being the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, have performed well. However, concerns over the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates loom. Nonetheless, these insurers stay focused on navigating the challenges faced by their commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nProduct Redesigning: Industry players are finding new solutions and ways to improve their sales and profitability. Insurers are refraining from selling long-duration term life insurance. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with \u201cliving\u201d benefits more than those with death benefits. Increased awareness about having coverages continues to support the life insurance business. A compelling product portfolio will thus aid sales of life insurers. Also, prudently pricing the products and balancing customers' preferences and claim costs will be the key to driving growth. Per a report published in ReporterLinker, global life insurance gross written premium is expected to be $2.5 trillion by 2026. Per Statista\u2019s report, gross written premium is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 1.7%.\n\nIncreased Adoption of Technology: Companies are now using electronic applications, e-signatures and electronic policy delivery. Carriers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data makes premium calculation easier and reduces risk. Increased automation is expected to drive premium growth and boost efficiency. Moreover, accelerated digitization, as evident from the increased adoption of generative AI, cognitive intelligence and blockchain, should help life insurers curb operational costs and aid margin expansion. Insurers are investing heavily in technological advancements to ensure efficiency and smooth functioning. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy Prospects\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects for the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Life Insurance industry, within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #105, which places it in the top 42% of the 255 Zacks industries.

        "content": "DULUTH, Ga., July 16, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) announced today that after carefully considering various options, the Board of Directors has opted to exit its senior health business by relinquishing ownership of e-TeleQuote Insurance, Inc. (e-TeleQuote). The senior health subsidiary, acquired in July 2021, does not have a clear path toward anticipated profitability within an acceptable timeframe in the increasingly challenging senior health distribution market. Further, the industry is facing an uncertain regulatory environment that could adversely impact the business.\n\nThe Board and management recognize that there remains significant demand for senior healthcare due to the aging of the U.S. population and continues to believe that Primerica\u2019s unique ability to reach middle-income families through its independent sales force is a clear competitive advantage. However, Primerica\u2019s ownership of a senior health business has not created the near-term stockholder value that had been anticipated at the time of the acquisition of e-TeleQuote.\n\nWith the assistance of a third-party consultant specializing in turn-around and restructuring transactions, Primerica determined that relinquishing its ownership of e-TeleQuote is the most expeditious way to exit its senior health business while maximizing Primerica\u2019s residual stockholder value. Primerica expects to terminate its rights to e-TeleQuote no later than September 30, 2024. On or prior to such time, e-TeleQuote expects to issue shares of its common stock to a third party who has not yet been identified. It is expected that such third party, which may consist of one or more entities, will ultimately own e-TeleQuote when Primerica terminates its rights.\n\n\"Various options for exiting the senior health market were carefully considered and, among other things, the significant structural changes the sector has undergone since e-TeleQuote\u2019s acquisition drove the decision,\" said Glenn Williams, CEO of Primerica. \"We will continue to support client relationships with no plans to decrease staffing levels at e-TeleQuote during the transition.\"\n\nSeniors who selected a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement policy with the help of an e-TeleQuote agent will not be impacted by this change since they are clients of the insurance carrier that provides their policy. e-TeleQuote will continue to service clients, and Primerica representatives will continue to make referrals to e-TeleQuote\u2019s licensed agents, through the date Primerica terminates its ownership of e-TeleQuote. Following such time, the new owners of e-TeleQuote will be responsible for communicating with e-TeleQuote clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nForward-Looking Statements Except for historical information contained in this press release, the statements in this press release are forward-looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "content": "The vast majority of middle-income Americans say they are struggling to keep up financially after years of elevated inflation in the U.S., with two-thirds reporting they feel they are falling behind due to the high cost of living.\n\nThat's according to Primerica's Financial Security Monitor (FSM) survey for the second quarter of 2024, which polled more than 1,000 U.S. adults with incomes between $30,000 and $130,000. Soaring prices for everyday goods over the past few years has wreaked havoc on household budgets.\n\nSixty-six percent of the respondents surveyed between June 8 through 11 said their income was falling behind their cost of living, and 48% said they were either cutting costs or quit saving altogether in order to make ends meet.\n\nThe data is consistent with separate recent findings published by the National True Cost of Living Coalition, which showed that 65% of Americans whose incomes are 200% above the national poverty line \u2013 which is about $62,300 for a family of four, often considered middle class \u2013 said they are struggling financially.\n\nHOW IT STARTED\u2026 HOW IT'S GOING: JULY 4 BBQ COSTS FLARE UP UNDER BIDEN\n\nPrimerica's analysis pointed to \"a major shift in spending and saving habits among middle-income families,\" finding that 80% of households are preparing more meals at home rather than eating meals at restaurants or ordering take-out over the past year.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe top reason cited for scaling back on dining out was budget concerns, with 72% stating it was a primary factor for their decision. Sixty-two percent of respondents said they made the move due to \"unreasonably high\" restaurant prices.\n\n\"Middle-income families are continuing to make adjustments in their budgets in an attempt to manage the ongoing high cost of living,\" said Glenn Williams, CEO of Primerica. \"Unfortunately, their difficult decisions include the increasing use of credit cards and scaling back saving for the future, which both could negatively impact their long-term financial condition.\"\n\nHOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2007\n\nMost households have seen their monthly expenses rise as the result of the ongoing inflation crisis. Although the consumer price index has fallen from a peak of 9.1%, it remains notably higher than pre-pandemic levels. And when compared with January 2021, before prices began to spike, inflation is up more than 18%. A person shops in a supermarket in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022.\n\nGrocery prices are up more than 21% from the start of 2021, and shelter costs are up 18.37%, according to FOX Business calculations.

While a positive indicator as inflation slows down, middle-income households are still struggling to make up financial ground, with purchasing power running only slightly higher than the index baseline of January 2019. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nCooking at home overwhelmingly preferred (80%) to eating out\n\nDULUTH, Ga., June 27, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, released its Financial Security Monitor\u2122 (FSM\u2122) survey for the second quarter of 2024. This national survey sheds light on the sentiments of consumers regarding their economic stability during this quarter finding that even amid reports of an improving economy they are not feeling the effects in their pocketbooks. Two-thirds of middle-income families reported they are falling behind the cost of living.\n\nThis perception may be influencing individual financial habits with 80% of households reportedly cooking more meals at home instead of dining out or ordering takeout over the past year. The top two reasons for this shift in behavior were budget concerns, with 72% of respondents acknowledging this as a primary factor, followed by unreasonably high restaurant prices, which was a key factor for 62% of respondents.\n\n\"Middle-income families are continuing to make adjustments in their budgets in an attempt to manage the ongoing high cost of living,\" said Glenn Williams, CEO of Primerica. \"Unfortunately, their difficult decisions include the increasing use of credit cards and scaling back saving for the future, which both could negatively impact their long-term financial condition.\"\n\nThis latest FSM\u2122 survey coincides with the release of Primerica\u2019s Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122), which indicates middle-income households experienced a slight increase in purchasing power as the HBI\u2122 rose for the first time in 5 months \u2014 100.3% in May, up from 100.1% in April 2024. While a positive indicator as inflation slows down, middle-income households are still struggling to make up financial ground, with purchasing power running only slightly higher than the index baseline of January 2019.\n\n\"It\u2019s mildly encouraging that, after taking overall inflation into account, middle-income households saw an average real income gain of 1.3% over the past 12 months,\" said Amy Crews Cutts, Ph.D., CBE\u00ae, economic consultant to Primerica. \"Yet as gasoline prices fell, the costs of other necessity goods rose more quickly, and it will take time for people to feel that both the broader economic and their own financial standing are on the rise.\"\n\nKey Findings from Primerica\u2019s U.S. Middle-Income Financial Security Monitor\n\nReports of cutting costs or pausing savings altogether by middle-income families remained steady. During the first quarter, 46% of families reported they were scaling back with 48% reporting the same during the second quarter. The percentage of people cooking at home has increased. There is a major shift in spending and saving habits among middle-income families, including a staggering 4:1 ratio of families who report cooking meals at home compared to eating at restaurants or ordering takeout. Majority grasp financial basics but not complexities. Overall, two-thirds (65%) of households feel confident in making sound financial decisions without outside help, particularly when it comes to financial fundamentals like building good credit (87% confident), paying down credit card debt (83%) and creating and following a financial budget (74%). However, households continue to express less confidence when it comes to more complex financial matters, including setting up a retirement account such as a 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account (IRA) (66% confident), buying life insurance (63%), and investing in stocks (50%). Anxiety and limited time are the main drivers in lack of financial planning. More than a quarter (31%) say they don\u2019t contribute to a savings account, follow a budget, contribute to an investment account or set a financial budget each month. Anxiety (29%) and not having time (19%) continue to be cited as the biggest challenges people have tracking their financial information.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrimerica Financial Security Monitor\u2122 (FSM\u2122) Topline Trends Data\n\nJun\n\n2024 Mar\n\n2024 Dec\n\n2023 Sept\n\n2023 Jun\n\n2023 Mar\n\n2023 Dec\n\n2022 Sep\n\n2022 Jun\n\n2022 How would you rate the condition of your personal finances?

Polling was conducted online from June 8-11, 2024. Using Dynamic Online Sampling, Change Research polled 1,017 adults nationwide with incomes between $30,000 and $130,000. Post-stratification weights were made on gender, age, race, education and Census region to reflect the population of these adults based on the five-year averages in the 2021 American Community Survey, published by the U.S. Census. The margin of error is 3.0%.

The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\nThe HBI\u2122 is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI\u2122 uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent \"normal\" economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeriodically, prior HBI\u2122 values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI\u2122 data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI\u2122 data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

        "title": "Primerica (NYSE:PRI) shareholders have earned a 14% CAGR over the last five years",
        "content": "Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 11% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. Unfortunately its return of 83% is below the market return of 95%.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Primerica\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Primerica managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Primerica's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Primerica's TSR for the last 5 years was 96%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nPrimerica provided a TSR of 19% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 14% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Primerica , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut note: Primerica may not be the best stock to buy.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the best place to retire in BC (British Columbia) on a budget. If you wish to see our full list, please switch over to 12 Best Places to Retire in BC (British Columbia) on a Budget.\n\nOn Retiring to Canada\n\nConcerns regarding retirement security are becoming increasingly common among Americans. Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE: LNC) reports that having enough income in retirement is the #3 ranked concern among consumers across all generations. For their Canadian counterparts, the situation isn\u2019t any better. A survey on financial uncertainty by Primerica, Inc (NYSE: PRI) shows that retirement savings were the 4th biggest concern among Canadians, impacting 36% of respondents. Amid the rising cost of living and longer life spans, it is easy to understand why so many people are concerned about retirement savings. In a study on the Canadian retirement system, Deloitte reported that 86% of pre-retirees (aged 55-64) are at risk of running out of money during retirement. Retirement concerns in Canada have amped up during the last 5 years, as revealed in a study by the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY). According to the study, the proportion of Canadian retirees concerned about outliving their retirement has increased from 37% in 2018 to 43% as per the latest surveys.\n\nFinancial Literacy Regarding Retirement\n\nOne reason Canadians continue to struggle with retirement savings is a lack of financial literacy. According to the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY), among retirees and pre-retirees, just 53% of those surveyed said they understand how their assets and investments will work together to provide them a paycheck in retirement, while 49% understand the tax implications of withdrawals. Similarly, Primerica, Inc (NYSE: PRI) reports that 68% of Canadian families feel their education did not adequately prepare them for managing their finances in adulthood. According to Primerica, Inc (NYSE: PRI), 72% of middle-income Canadians agree that everyone should have access to a financial professional, however, not many are willing to invest in such an expense.\n\nTo make matters worse, many Canadian adults continue to disregard the need for retirement planning. According to the aforementioned study by the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY), nearly half of respondents don't have a documented plan for retirement. A lack of financial planning can have dire consequences on retirement prospects, with the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY) highlighting that those who have a documented retirement plan are 21% more confident about maintaining their standard of living in retirement, compared to those without a documented plan. These consequences may be even more severe for women, who on average tend to receive lower benefits in retirement than men.\n\nStory continues\n\nImplications for Women\n\nAccording to data from Ontario\u2019s Pay Equity Office, women in the country receive 83 cents in retirement income to every dollar received by a man. A lack of retirement income might be one reason Canadian women are less assured of how to manage retirement finances than men. Our article on Best States to Retire for Women in the US highlights how US women greatly lag behind men when it comes to contributions, savings, and retirement confidence in general. Similarly, in Canada, women are 11% less likely than men to say they feel in control of their finances, per Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO).\n\nAccordingly, recent findings by the Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO) highlight how the rising cost of living and inflation have a greater impact on women in comparison to men. Per the Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO), the proportion of women concerned regarding the rising cost of living and inflation is 7% greater than men. For those concerned regarding retirement savings and security, one method of ensuring a comfortable retirement is to relocate to less expensive places, where inflation and housing costs do not belligerently chisel away at your nest egg. Unfortunately, this might be a difficult ask for those looking to retire in British Columbia.\n\nRetirement in British Columbia\n\nCurrently, it is estimated that 61% of Canadians reside in either Ontario or Quebec. In comparison, the province of British Columbia is home to just under 14% of Canadians. Apart from its distance to major centers such as Ottawa, Toronto, and Montreal, one reason that British Columbia is a less popular destination to live in is its housing costs.\n\nAccording to WOWA, the average home price in British Columbia is $1.0 million, in comparison to $0.9 million in Ontario and $0.5 million in Quebec. Similarly, a study by Westland Insurance in 2023 revealed that British Columbia is by far the most expensive province in Canada in terms of cost of living.\n\nHowever, like any state in America, the province of British Columbia is home to a diverse range of small towns and bustling cities, meaning that with the right lens, one can find many affordable places to live in BC. With this goal in mind, join us as we set out to find the best places to retire in BC (British Columbia) on a budget.

The swimming hole at Top Bridge Regional Park is a natural pool that draws visitors from all over the island and is just one of the many excursions retirees can enjoy here.\n\nThe median home price in Parksville is $719K, which is far lower than the provincial average.

        "title": "SURVEY: Majority of Middle-Income Canadians Report Lacking Basic Financial Education",
        "content": "Understanding taxes, managing loans, setting household budgets among tasks families feel traditional education didn\u2019t properly address\n\nMISSISSAUGA, Ontario, May 14, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products to middle-income families in North America, released its latest Financial Security MonitorTM (FSMTM) survey for Canada reflecting how middle-income families feel about their finances. The survey highlights significant concern about Canadians\u2019 financial education and economic outlook, particularly amid growing inflation.\n\nThe survey found more than two-thirds (68%) of families feel their education did not adequately prepare them for managing their finances in adulthood. Specifically, a majority report that schools did not properly teach them basic financial principals, including the impact of taxes on their finances (85%), how to take out and pay back loans (81%), planning for the use and repayment of student loans (78%) or setting a household budget (77%).\n\nThe lack of financial education may be why nearly three-quarters (72%) of Canadians believe access to a financial professional should be universal. However, less than two-fifths (38%) think they can afford one.\n\n\"At a time when many Canadians feel uncertain about inflation and their financial futures, our survey highlights significant gaps in financial education and preparedness, as well as the misconception that financial advice is too costly for middle-income families,\" said John Adams, CEO of Primerica Canada. \"We have long recognized these households need support, and we continue to advocate for making this type of support affordable to help Canadians of all income levels build and maintain financial security.\"\n\nThe survey also highlights broader attitudes around financial uncertainty and local economic conditions. While a majority (65%) report feeling good about their own personal finances, three-quarters (75%) of middle-income Canadians rate the economic health of their province as poor. The survey also found Canadians remain highly concerned about inflation (61%) and physical health (61%), while expressing less worry overpaying for food (39%) and retirement savings (36%).\n\n\"Middle-income Canadians who feel left behind when it comes to financial education and guidance are increasingly turning to life insurance companies and the individuals that represent them for advice,\" said Gary Edwards, Ph.D., co-founder and research lead of Golfdale Consulting. \"Given that we know the trust factor is there, the focus should now be on ensuring access remains in place, so financial guidance is in reach for anyone that needs it.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Findings from Primerica\u2019s Canadian Financial Security Monitor\u2122\n\nMost say financial education is insufficient. A sizeable majority (68%) of middle-income Canadians feel schools did not prepare them well for managing their personal finances in adulthood, indicating a substantial gap in financial education. Personal finances viewed more positively than economic health of province. Nearly two-thirds (65%) of middle-income Canadians rate their personal finances as good or excellent while three-quarters (75%) view the economic health of their province as not good or poor. More families are saving for the future. A majority have a savings account (72%) or a self-funded, tax-free savings account (58%), an increase over previous surveys. In addition, nearly half (47%) have a self-funded, registered retirement account. Emergency savings lacking. More than one-third (35%) of middle-income Canadians do not have an emergency fund. While this marks a slight improvement over previous years, it also highlights an ongoing financial vulnerability. Inflation and health are top worries. The survey identifies inflation and health-related expenses, both at 61%, as the primary concerns among middle-income Canadians. Additional financial pressures come from grocery costs (39%) and challenges in saving for retirement (36%). Financial advice is seen as essential. Most middle-income Canadians (72%) agree that everyone should have access to a financial professional. However, just two-fifths (38%) believe they can afford it.\n\nAbout Primerica\u2019s Canadian Financial Security Monitor\u2122 (FSM\u2122)\n\nSince 2020, the Canadian Financial Security Monitor\u2122 has surveyed middle-income households across Canada to gain a clear picture of their financial situation.

        "title": "Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) Just Released Its First-Quarter Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think",
        "content": "Last week saw the newest first-quarter earnings release from Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$743m were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 4.7% to hit US$3.93 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Primerica  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the five analysts covering Primerica are now predicting revenues of US$3.02b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a reasonable 2.8% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 5.2% to US$17.71. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$3.00b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$17.90 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$253. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Primerica analyst has a price target of US$275 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$235. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Primerica's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 3.8% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 8.5% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 5.9% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Primerica.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Primerica. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

        "content": "Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024\n\nPrimerica, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Primerica's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Nicole Russell, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nNicole Russell: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Primerica's first quarter earnings call. A copy of our earnings press release, along with other materials relevant to today's call, are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. Joining our call today are Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Williams; and Chief Financial Officer, Tracy Tan. Our comments this morning may contain forward-looking statements in accordance with the safe harbor provision of the Securities Litigation Reform Act. We assume no obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, and refer you to our most recent Form 10-K filings as may be modified by subsequent Form 10-Q for a list of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or implied.\n\nWe also reference certain non-GAAP measures which we believe provide additional insight into the company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP numbers are included at the end of our earnings press release and are available on our Investor Relations website. I would now like to turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn Williams: Thank you, Nicole, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our first quarter's results reflected the fundamental strength of our main lines of business, Term Life and Investment and Savings products as well as the continued growth of the sales force. The resilience of our model is illustrated by our ability to deliver this growth in the face of ongoing economic pressures facing middle-income families. Starting with a quick recap of our financial results. Adjusted net operating income of $137 million increased 4% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted operating income per share of $3.91 increased 10%. The earnings power of our core businesses was partly offset by the underperformance of our Senior Health business, which incurred a $14 million loss during the quarter.\n\nOn the capital deployment front, we repurchased $109 million of our common stock and paid $26 million in regular dividends during the quarter. As noted in our release, the Board recently declared a $0.75 per share dividend payable in June. We are pleased with our sustained momentum in growing our distribution capabilities. Our representatives played an important role in educating middle-income households and helping them find appropriate financial solutions. During the first quarter, we recruited over 110,000 individuals, representing a year-over-year increase of 18%. New life licenses continue to benefit from the strong pipeline of new recruits. During the quarter, nearly 13,000 reps obtained a new life license, up 16%, fueling 5% year-over-year growth in the size of our sales force to end March with a total of 142,855 life licensed reps.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe appeal of our business opportunity continues to resonate, and the current economic uncertainties can be a catalyst to motivate individuals seeking additional income opportunities or an alternative to their current employment. Our model is unique. Recruits who already have a life insurance license become part of Primerica at no cost. Unlicensed recruits pay a licensing fee of $99 to cover the cost of the entire exam preparation and licensing process for both life insurance and securities licenses. The vast majority of our new reps also pay a technology fee of $25 per month, providing communications, training, recordkeeping and transaction capabilities. Both the licensing and technology fees offset the company's hard costs. None of our representatives are compensated from these fees.\n\nWe continue to see good traction in recruiting, and we have a solid process in place to help new recruits prepare for their licensing exam, which leads us to anticipate full year growth in the size of the sales force in 2024 will be above 3%. Let's look more closely at sales results. During the first quarter, we issued 86,587 new term life policies, representing a 2% increase over the prior year period. We believe household financial pressures from compounding increases in the cost of living may be causing some headwinds to new sales. Productivity, as measured by the number of issued policies per life license rent per month, was 0.20 compared to 0.21 in the prior year period and within our historical range. Looking ahead, we anticipate full year growth in the number of policies issued to be around 3% to 5%.\n\nFirst quarter total investment product sales were $2.8 billion, up 20% compared to the prior year period. We are seeing strong demand for products across the board, including U.S. and Canadian mutual funds, variable annuities and managed accounts. Preliminary results show that April sales are similarly strong. However, we remain mindful of the impact that current economic uncertainty can have on middle-income families. Barring an unexpected change in the market sentiment, we anticipate full year sales to increase by as much as high single digits during 2024. Ending client asset values continue to benefit from strong equity market appreciation, ending the quarter at $103 billion. This marks the first time in our history that client assets have exceeded $100 billion, and serves as an important reminder of the role that Primerica plays in helping middle-income families save for the future.\n\nThe latest Department of Labor fiduciary rule is now final, with an effective date in late September 2024 and a 1-year period for complete implementation of the rule. With almost 75% of our ISP business in retirement accounts, we made changes to our process in response to the 2020 version of the rule. For example, we already acknowledged fiduciary status for most retirement recommendations. We're reviewing our sales force programs and will consider making adjustments as needed. Should the rule become effective on schedule, we expect no more than modest additional changes in our sales processes if changes are needed. Turning next to Senior Health sales results. The number of approved policies during the quarter declined 18% year-over-year. As we saw last quarter, some of the pressure on new sales was due to us having 16% fewer e-TeleQuote agents compared to the first quarter of 2023. A young professional woman holding a laptop, discussing health insurance plans at her desk.\n\nThere were also headwinds due to an issue verifying the eligibility of applicants for both Medicare and Medicaid because of a service disruption at Change Healthcare that impacted the entire industry. The second quarter showing sales growth with more improved policies in April year-over-year, which represents the first time we've seen year-over-year application growth since acquiring e-TeleQuote. Early indicators from our revised agent recruiting and onboarding process are showing promising results, and tenured agent attrition is down 40% compared to last year. Our first quarter financial results were adversely affected by a $7.8 million negative revenue tail adjustment to reflect lower renewals. An increase in policy churn was created by certain carriers making modifications to plan benefits this year, driving up competition and plan switching.\n\nSome of the switching occurred among applicants who were e-TeleQuote clients both before and after the switch, but are still included in the churn calculation. As I noted last quarter, we've been carefully studying how to grow e-TeleQuote into a profitable long-term business. We retained a global management consulting firm to help us thoroughly understand the opportunities and challenges in this business. We concluded that the senior health industry remains attractive, with an aging population that will continue to need assistance in selecting a health care plan appropriate for their situations. It's also clear that Primerica representatives serve as a valuable source of referrals for e-TeleQuote and provides us with a unique advantage. However, the industry is continuing to evolve and unknowns remain, such as the recent CMS rule making and competition among carriers to attract new clients.\n\nWith the first quarter results final, we expect a loss of around $25 million to $30 million in 2024. We are taking measured steps as we continue to evaluate this business, and we do not anticipate a need to contribute capital to the business during 2024. At the end of the quarter, we confirmed that a $50 million payment will be made to us under our representation and warranty insurance policy that we purchased in connection with our acquisition of e-TeleQuote, the full amount we sought under the policy terms. Agreements provided for the payments have been signed, and we expect to receive the fund shortly. The proceeds of the claims will be recognized as a gain in earnings in the second quarter and excluded from the company's adjusted operating results to provide comparability to the prior year results.\n\nWe've seen tremendous change in the senior health industry since acquiring e-TeleQuote, and its financial results are lagging our expectations. However, the results for our core businesses -- business segments are strong. Primerica is solid, and our business is well balanced. Finally, excitement is building as we head into our convention in July. The event is possibly current momentum, and we expect strong activity afterwards. Our convention is an important element of our larger vision to continue to grow and serve middle-income families across North America. With that, I'll hand it over to Tracy.\n\nTracy Tan: Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. Starting with the Term Life segment. Year-over-year operating revenues of $440 million increased 5%, driven by 6% growth in adjusted direct premiums, while pretax operating income of $138 million rose 6%. Looking at our key financial ratios, both the benefits and claims ratio at 58% and the DAC amortization ratio at 12.2% were consistent with the prior year period and stable as expected under LDTI accounting. The insurance expense ratio was 7.8% in the current year period, generally consistent with the prior year period. The segment operating margin was 22%, unchanged compared to the prior year period. As we noted over the last few quarters, mortality remains generally in line with our expectations.\n\nWe continue to see higher lapses across multiple durations. We believe that the current higher cost of living likely continues to put financial stress on middle-income families, leading to those higher lapses. Persistency on policies issued over the last year was generally in line with our assumptions. Our guidance for full year 2024 remains unchanged. We expect ADP to grow approximately 5% to 6%, and our financial ratios to remain stable, with the benefits and claims ratio around 58% and gas amortization ratio around 12%. We are also reiterating our full year guidance, with the operating margin to be around 22%. Although I want to remind investors that insurance expenses are subject to some seasonal variations. Turning next to the results of our Investment and Savings Products segment.\n\nOperating revenues of $244 million and pretax operating income of $66 million increased 16% and 17%, respectively, benefiting from very strong sales and growth in the size of client asset values. Sales-based revenue of $89 million rose 23%, due to 24% higher revenue-generating sales, while asset-based revenue of $129 million rose 15% in line with a 15% increase in average client asset values. Sales commissions for both sales and asset-based products increased in correlation with revenue. In the Senior Health segment, we incurred $14.2 million pretax operating loss which included a $7.8 million negative tail adjustment. Excluding the tail adjustment, the loss was $6.4 million compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the prior period. The current quarter was pressured by lower sales volume and a higher cost of acquisition related to the -- relevant to the number of approved policies, primarily driven by the cost of third-party technology providers and investments in hiring and training new agents.\n\nLTV, which included marketing development funds in the calculation, was 8% lower than the prior year period after reallocating marketing development funds through LTV in the prior year period. This is a result of increased policy churn as certain carriers modify plan benefits, which encourage switching. The C&O segment recorded a pretax adjustment operating loss of $11.7 million versus a loss of $11 million in the prior year period, as higher net investment income was offset by higher operating expenses, which I will describe further in a moment. Finally, consolidated insurance and other operating expenses were $164 million during the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and in line with our prior guidance. This reflects typical higher seasonal expenses as a result of timing of equity compensation vesting.\n\nThe expense growth in the Term Life segment was more modest, due to the redirection of technology resources that supported our new Term Life product offering last year, two more infrastructure-related activities in our C&O segment this year. Overall, our expense increase was driven by growth in the business and increase in employee compensation as annual merit increases took place and the carryover effect of higher employee costs layered in the later part of 2023. We maintain that our full year 2024 insurance and other operating expense growth expectations is still on track for a year-over-year increase of around $40 million or 6% to 8% in 2024. Our investment asset portfolio remains well diversified and has relatively short duration of 4.7 years.\n\nThe average rate on new investment purchases was 5.7% for the quarter with an average rating of A. The portfolio has a net unrealized loss of $231 million at the end of March, slightly higher than prior year-end, as rates increased during the quarter. We believe that the remaining unrealized loss is a function of interest rates and not due to underlying credit concerns, and we have the intended ability to hold these investments until maturity. With that, operator, I open the line for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n20 Best Korean Skincare Products of 2024 and\n\n12 Cheap Lithium Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PRI.\n\nRelease Date: May 07, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nPrimerica Inc reported a 4% increase in adjusted net operating income to $137 million and a 10% increase in adjusted operating income per share to $3.91. The company achieved a significant milestone with client assets exceeding $100 billion for the first time, reflecting strong equity market appreciation. First quarter total investment product sales rose by 20% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, indicating robust demand across various financial products. Primerica Inc successfully recruited over 110,000 individuals in the first quarter, an 18% increase year-over-year, enhancing its distribution capabilities. The company continued its shareholder-friendly activities, repurchasing $109 million of its common stock and paying $26 million in regular dividends.\n\nNegative Points\n\nThe Senior Health business segment underperformed, incurring a $14 million loss during the quarter. Productivity per life license representative decreased slightly from 0.21 to 0.20, indicating potential challenges in sales efficiency. The company noted an increase in policy churn due to carriers modifying plan benefits, which could impact future renewals and customer retention. Primerica Inc faces ongoing economic pressures affecting middle-income families, which could pose headwinds to new sales and policy renewals. Despite strong recruitment numbers, the increase in new recruits could put pressure on productivity levels as newer agents typically take time to reach peak productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: First, just a quick one on the $50 million of proceeds. Do you have any expected use of that? Was that part of your original plan for the buyback guidance? Or do you just plan to retain that capital? A: Glenn Jackson Williams, CEO & Director of Primerica, Inc., stated that the Board will consider the $50 million as part of the overall capital deployment plans moving forward.\n\nQ: Given recent market concerns over insurance sales practices of independent contractors, can you comment on how you view this risk within your company and your comfort level with the sales practices of your organization? A: CEO Glenn Jackson Williams emphasized the company's awareness of these risks, especially given its large and decentralized sales force. He highlighted the company's deliberate choice of simple product sets, robust training, and compliance infrastructure to mitigate risks associated with misselling.\n\nQ: Looking in Term Life, the average premium per policy, how do you see that trending throughout '24? And are you still seeing a little pressure there? A: CEO Glenn Jackson Williams noted that while the average premium generally follows inflation, there has been some pressure, not increasing as much as historically seen. He attributed this to the financial pressures on middle-income families, which also poses a headwind to sales.\n\nQ: On the recruiting side, with the significant number of new recruits and licensed rep growth, is it fair to assume that the productivity level will likely trail off versus 2023? A: CEO Glenn Jackson Williams acknowledged that rapid growth in the sales force could pressure productivity levels, as newer agents are generally not as productive initially. However, he expressed confidence in maintaining productivity within historical norms despite these pressures.\n\nQ: Have you thought about just shutting down the Senior Health business? A: CEO Glenn Jackson Williams explained that all options have been considered, including shutting down the Senior Health business. However, they believe there is a path to sustainable profitability and are not currently putting capital into the business, which reduces pressure.\n\nQ: Can you unpack the tail revenue adjustment a bit more? Is this something we could see in future quarters? A: CFO Tracy Xiangyan Tan clarified that the tail adjustment was driven by increased policy churn during the renewal process. She emphasized the seasonality of the business, suggesting that similar scale adjustments are not expected in future quarters outside of peak periods.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Primerica (PRI) Q1 Earnings: Taking a Look at Key Metrics Versus Estimates",
        "content": "Primerica (PRI) reported $741.66 million in revenue for the quarter ended March 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. EPS of $3.91 for the same period compares to $3.49 a year ago.\n\nThe reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $738.43 million, representing a surprise of +0.44%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of -4.87%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $4.11.\n\nWhile investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Primerica performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nAverage Client Asset Values: $99.5 billion compared to the $98.15 billion average estimate based on two analysts. Life Insurance Policies Issued: 86,587 versus the two-analyst average estimate of 88,619. Life-Licensed Sales Force, End of period: 142,855 versus the two-analyst average estimate of 142,011.

        "content": "Primerica (PRI) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.91 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.11 per share. This compares to earnings of $3.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.87%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this life insurance and financial products company would post earnings of $4.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.25, delivering a surprise of -0.23%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nPrimerica , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry, posted revenues of $741.66 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $694.97 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPrimerica shares have added about 5.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Primerica?\n\nWhile Primerica has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Primerica: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.41 on $739.94 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $17.78 on $2.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Life Insurance is currently in the bottom 14% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (FG), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 8.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +128.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nF&G Annuities & Life, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $1.21 billion, up 39.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: PRI) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Total revenues of $742.8 million increased 8% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net income of $137.9 million increased 8%, while earnings per diluted share of $3.93 increased 14% compared to the prior year period.\n\nAdjusted operating revenues of $741.7 million increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted net operating income of $137.0 million increased 4%, while adjusted operating earnings per diluted share of $3.91 increased 10% compared to the prior year period.\n\nFinancial results during the first quarter of 2024 reflected the stability of the Company\u2019s large in-force block of term life insurance, higher investment products sales, appreciation of client asset values, and the impact of higher interest rates on net investment income. Results were partly offset by weakness in the Senior Health business, which reported a loss of $14 million. Distribution results demonstrated sustained momentum in recruiting and the Company\u2019s continued success in licensing new representatives.\n\n\"Our financial results reflect the fundamental strength in our core Term Life and ISP segments and the predictability of our model, particularly during uncertain times,\" said Glenn Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Primerica, inc. \"We started 2024 with solid momentum and we are well-positioned to grow the size of our sales force for the third consecutive year.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Distribution & Segment Results Distribution Results Q1 2024 Q1 2023 % Change Life-Licensed Sales Force 142,855 136,430 5 % Recruits 110,710 93,540 18 % New Life-Licensed Representatives 12,949 11,118 16 % Life Insurance Policies Issued 86,587 84,561 2 % Life Productivity (1) 0.20 0.21 * Issued Term Life Face Amount ($ billions) (2) $ 28.7 $ 28.1 2 % ISP Product Sales ($ billions) $ 2.8 $ 2.3 20 % Average Client Asset Values ($ billions) $ 99.5 $ 86.6 15 % Senior Health Submitted Policies (3) 16,068 19,826 (19 )% Senior Health Approved Policies (4) 15,023 18,413 (18 )% Closed U.S. Mortgage Volume ($ million brokered) $ 71.4 $ 55.6 28 %\n\n_______________________ (1) Life productivity equals policies issued divided by the average number of life insurance licensed representatives per month.

(2) See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section and the Adjusted Operating Results reconciliation tables at the end of this release for additional information.\n\nLife Insurance Licensed Sales Force\n\nThe attractiveness of Primerica\u2019s business opportunity continues to generate a high degree of interest, creating momentum in both recruiting and licensing and fueling growth in the size of the sales force. During the first quarter, recruiting increased 18% compared to the same period in 2023 while new life licenses increased 16%. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a total of 142,855 independent life-licensed representatives, a 5% increase year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerm Life Insurance\n\nLife insurance policies issued during the first quarter of 2024 increased 2% to 86,587, helping to drive $28.7 billion in term life face amount issued during the three months ended March 31, 2024. Productivity, as measured by the number of policies issued per life-licensed representative per month, was 0.20 policies compared to 0.21 policies in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nCompared to the prior year period, first quarter revenues increased 5% to $440.4 million due principally to a 6% increase in adjusted direct premium. Pre-tax operating income of $138.4 million increased 6%. The benefits and claims ratio at 58.0% and the DAC amortization ratio at 12.2% were both stable year-over-year. The Term Life operating margin was 22.0%, in line with the prior year period\n\nInvestment and Savings Products\n\nTotal product sales of $2.8 billion during the first quarter increased 20% compared to the prior year period, driven by continued strong sales of mutual funds in both the U.S. and Canada as well as solid demand for variable annuities and managed accounts. On March 31, 2024, client asset values were $103 billion, up 18% year-over-year primarily due to strong equity market appreciation as well continued net client inflows of $274 million during the quarter.\n\nFirst quarter revenues of $243.7 million increased 16% compared to the prior year period, while pre-tax operating income of $65.6 million increased 17% driven by a combination of strong sales and an increase in average client asset values. Sales-based commissions and fees revenues increased 23%, in line with a 24% increase in revenue generating product sales, while sales-based commission expenses increased 20%. Asset-based revenues increased 15%, in line with the growth in average client asset values. The change in asset-based commission expenses was consistent with asset-based revenues, excluding revenues on Canadian segregated funds. Expenses related to Canadian segregated funds are reflected in insurance commissions and amortization of DAC.\n\nSenior Health\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, a total of 15,023 policies were approved by carriers, representing 18% fewer policies than in the prior year period due to fewer tenured agents and the negative impact of an industry-wide service disruption in a third-party service provider that affected the ability of our agents to verify plan eligibility. The lifetime value of commissions per approved policy (\"LTV\") was $926, while contract acquisition costs per approved policy (\"CAC\") were $901 for a LTV/CAC ratio of 1.0.\n\nFirst quarter revenues of $6.9 million included a $7.8 million negative tail revenue adjustment. The tail adjustment was largely driven by an increase in plan switching. Total contract acquisition costs declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower sales volume, while operating expenses remained unchanged. The operating loss was $14.2 million compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the prior year period. The Company did not contribute cash to the segment during the first quarter of 2024, nor does it expect to do so for the remainder of the year.\n\nCorporate and Other Distributed Products\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the segment recorded an adjusted operating loss of $11.7 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $11.0 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net investment income increased $6.6 million from the continued benefit of higher interest rates and growth in the size of the invested asset portfolio. Insurance and other operating expenses increased $7.4 million due to higher growth-related technology costs and employee-related compensation increase.\n\nCapital\n\nThe Company repurchased 465,938 shares of common stock for $109 million during the first quarter of 2024 and the Board of Directors has approved a dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on June 12, 2024 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2024.\n\nPrimerica has a strong balance sheet, including invested assets and cash at the holding company of $281 million. Primerica Life Insurance Company\u2019s statutory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio was estimated to be approximately 430% as of March 31, 2024.\n\nSubsequent Event\n\nIn April 2024, the Company executed agreements providing for the payment of certain claims filed by the Company under a Representation and Warranty insurance policy negotiated and purchased in connection with the acquisition of e-TeleQuote Insurance. The claims made by the Company involved breaches of certain representations and warranties relating to the pre-acquisition financial statements made by the sellers of e-TeleQuote in connection with the acquisition. The Company will recognize a gain in earnings during the three months ended June 30, 2024 of $50 million, which is equal to the aggregate proceeds to be received from the third-party insurers under the policy, reflecting the full coverage under the policy. The proceeds of this claim will be excluded from second quarter adjusted operating results to provide comparability to the prior year results.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company presents certain non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, the Company presents adjusted direct premiums, other ceded premiums, adjusted operating revenues, adjusted operating income before income taxes, adjusted net operating income, adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share.\n\nAdjusted direct premiums and other ceded premiums are net of amounts ceded under coinsurance transactions that were executed concurrent with our initial public offering (the \"IPO coinsurance transactions\") for all periods presented. We exclude amounts ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions in measuring adjusted direct premiums and other ceded premiums to present meaningful comparisons of the actual premiums economically maintained by the Company. Amounts ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions will continue to decline over time as policies terminate within this block of business.\n\nAdjusted operating revenues, adjusted operating income before income taxes, adjusted net operating income and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share exclude the impact of investment gains (losses), including credit impairments, and fair value mark-to-market (\"MTM\") investment adjustments for all periods presented. We exclude investment gains (losses), including credit impairments, and MTM investment adjustments in measuring these non-GAAP financial measures to eliminate period-over-period fluctuations that may obscure comparisons of operating results due to items such as the timing of recognizing gains (losses) and market pricing variations prior to an invested asset\u2019s maturity or sale that are not directly associated with the Company\u2019s insurance operations.\n\nAdjusted stockholders\u2019 equity excludes the impact of net unrealized investment gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented. We exclude unrealized investment gains (losses) in measuring adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity as unrealized gains (losses) from the Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities are largely caused by market movements in interest rates and credit spreads that do not necessarily correlate with the cash flows we will ultimately realize when an available-for-sale security matures or is sold. Adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity also excludes the difference in future policy benefits calculated using the current discount rate and future policy benefits calculated using the locked-in discount rate at contract issuance recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. We exclude the impact from the difference in the discount rate in measuring adjusted stockholders' equity as such difference is caused by market movements in interest rates that are not permanent and may not align with the cash flows we will ultimately incur when policy benefits are settled.\n\nOur definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of similar measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance. Furthermore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of the core ongoing business. These measures have limitations and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are attached to this release.\n\nEarnings Webcast Information\n\nPrimerica will hold a webcast on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern, to discuss the quarter\u2019s results.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Primerica (PRI) will announce quarterly earnings of $4.11 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 17.8% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $738.43 million, increasing 6.3% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.7% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Primerica metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenues- Net investment income' will reach $35.16 million. The estimate points to a change of +13.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenues- Commissions and fees' stands at $247.50 million. The estimate suggests a change of +6.9% year over year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Other, net' to come in at $19.59 million. The estimate suggests a change of +0.4% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- Net premiums' will reach $432.53 million. The estimate indicates a change of +4.9% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Corporate and Other Distributed Products' of $48.12 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Investment and Savings Products' to reach $226.63 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Term Life Insurance' will likely reach $439.62 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Adjusted Operating Revenues- Senior Health' should come in at $18.13 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Average Client Asset Values' at $98.15 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $86.58 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Life Insurance Policies Issued' should arrive at 88,619. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 84,561.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Life-Licensed Sales Force, End of period' reaching 142,011. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 136,430.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Recruits' will reach 95,274.

        "content": "Reinsurance Group (RGA) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.51 per share. This compares to earnings of $5.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 33.48%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.33 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nReinsurance Group shares have added about 18% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Reinsurance Group?\n\nWhile Reinsurance Group has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Reinsurance Group: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Life Insurance is currently in the bottom 11% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Primerica (PRI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 6.\n\nThis life insurance and financial products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.8%.

        "title": "Why We Think The CEO Of Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) May Soon See A Pay Rise",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nPrimerica's Annual General Meeting to take place on 8th of May Salary of US$600.0k is part of CEO Glenn Williams's total remuneration The overall pay is 48% below the industry average Over the past three years, Primerica's EPS grew by 20%  and over the past three years, the total shareholder return was 36%\n\nThe impressive results at Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) recently will be great news for shareholders. This would be kept in mind at the upcoming AGM on 8th of May which will be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. We think the CEO has done a pretty decent job and probably deserves a well-earned pay rise.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Primerica\n\nComparing Primerica, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nAccording to our data, Primerica, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$7.4b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$4.2m over the year to December 2023. We note that's a decrease of 13% compared to last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$600k.\n\nOn comparing similar companies from the American Insurance industry with market caps ranging from US$4.0b to US$12b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was US$8.0m. That is to say, Glenn Williams is paid under the industry median. Moreover, Glenn Williams also holds US$11m worth of Primerica stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$600k US$700k 14% Other US$3.6m US$4.1m 86% Total Compensation US$4.2m US$4.8m 100%\n\nOn an industry level, roughly 14% of total compensation represents salary and 86% is other remuneration. There isn't a significant difference between Primerica and the broader market, in terms of salary allocation in the overall compensation package. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nPrimerica, Inc.'s Growth\n\nOver the past three years, Primerica, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 20% per year. Its revenue is up 3.5% over the last year.\n\nThis demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. It's good to see a bit of revenue growth, as this suggests the business is able to grow sustainably. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nHas Primerica, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nBoasting a total shareholder return of 36% over three years, Primerica, Inc. has done well by shareholders. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.\n\nTo Conclude...\n\nThe company's solid performance might have made most shareholders happy, possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the matters to be discussed in the AGM. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.\n\nWhile it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. We did our research and spotted 2 warning signs for Primerica that investors should look into moving forward.\n\nImportant note: Primerica is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns.

Life insurers are the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment as they invest a large portion of their premiums. Increased automation is expected to drive premium growth and boost the efficiency of Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., Reinsurance Group of America, Inc., Primerica and Lincoln National Corp. However, with accelerated digitalization, expenses are likely to increase. Also, prudently pricing the products, balancing customers preferences and claim costs, remains a challenge.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Life Insurance industry comprises companies that offer life insurance coverages and retirement benefits to individuals and groups. The products include annuities, whole and term life insurance, accidental death insurance, health insurance, Medicare supplements and long-term healthcare policies. Sales benefit from the increasing demand for protection products.\n\nThe industry also includes companies providing wealth and asset management solutions. With a rise in the number of baby boomers, the demand for retirement benefits is increasing. Economic growth instills confidence. Per a Statista report, the life insurance market is expected to grow, with gross written premium expected to be $3.67 trillion in 2024. The industry has also been witnessing the accelerated adoption of technology. However, rising mortality or loss cost trends may impact the profitability of insurers.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Life Insurance Industry\n\nAn Improved Rate Environment: An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate-sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity and competitiveness positively. In times of persistently low interest rates, life insurers' income from investments becomes insufficient to meet the contractually guaranteed obligations of policyholders, which cannot be lowered.\n\nThus, they direct their funds into alternative investments like private equity, hedge funds and real estate, among others, to counter the challenge. The Fed has made 11 rate hikes since March 2022. Life insurers, being the direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, have performed well. However, concerns over the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates loom. Nonetheless, these insurers stay focused on navigating the challenges faced by their commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nProduct Redesigning: Industry players are finding new solutions and ways to improve their sales and profitability. Insurers are refraining from selling long-duration term life insurance. Also, life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with \u201cliving\u201d benefits more than those with death benefits.\n\nIncreased awareness continues to support the life insurance business. A compelling product portfolio will thus aid sales of life insurers. Also, prudently pricing the products, balancing customers' preferences and claim costs, will be the key to driving growth. Per a report published in ReporterLinker, global life insurance gross written premium is expected to be $2.5 trillion by 2026. Per Statista\u2019s report, gross written premium is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 1.7%.\n\nIncreased Adoption of Technology: Companies are now using electronic applications, e-signatures and electronic policy delivery. Carriers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data makes premium calculation easier and reduces risk. Increased automation is expected to drive premium growth and boost efficiency.\n\nMoreover, accelerated digitization, as evident from the increased adoption of generative AI, cognitive intelligence and blockchain, should help life insurers curb operational costs and aid margin expansion. Insurers are investing heavily in technological advancements to ensure efficiency and smooth functioning. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull prospects for the near term. The Zacks Life Insurance industry, within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #223, which places it in the bottom 11% of the 255 Zacks industries.

        "title": "BRP Group (BRP) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "BRP Group (BRP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 7, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $375.3 million, up 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BRP Group?\n\nFor BRP Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.39%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BRP Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that BRP Group would post earnings of $0.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of +27.27%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nBRP Group doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nPrimerica (PRI), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $4.11 for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +17.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $738.43 million, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Primerica has been revised 0.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.46%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Primerica will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "4 Insurers Set to Outperform Estimates This Earnings Season",
        "content": "Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Finance sector\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings are expected to improve 11.6%. Revenues are estimated to rise 3.6%. Results of Insurance, one of the Finance sector industries, are likely to reflect better pricing and exposure growth, accelerated digitalization and an improved interest rate. However, cat losses are likely to have weighed on profitability.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified four insurers, namely, Aflac Incorporated AFL, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited AXS, Horace Mann Educators Corporation HMN and Primerica, Inc. PRI, which are poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in first-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients \u2014 a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) \u2014 to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nFactors Likely to Impact Q1 Results\n\nFirst-quarter underwriting results are likely to benefit from continued better pricing, portfolio repositioning, proper segmentation, reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development.\r\n\r\nNon-life insurers, by the nature of their business, are exposed to catastrophe losses. Thus, their profitability is vulnerable to catastrophe losses. Gallagher Re\u2019s National Catastrophe and Climate Report estimates global insured losses from natural catastrophes at $20 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Catastrophes continued to provide impetus to policy renewal rates and aided in better pricing in the first quarter. Per a report in Insurance Journal, Marsh stated that global commercial insurance rates improved by 1% on average in the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nAuto premiums are likely to have improved, given increased travel across the world. On the flip side, increased severity per claim due to higher vehicle repair and medical costs is likely to have affected the loss ratio.\r\n\r\nA stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance.\r\n\r\nLife insurers have been redesigning products, focusing on protection products. The quarter is likely to have witnessed solid sales, given a rise in demand for protection products. Life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with \u201cliving\u201d benefits more than those with death benefits.\r\n\r\nA larger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in an improved rate environment are likely to have aided net investment income, an important component of insurers\u2019 top line.\r\n\r\nContinued investment in technological advancements is likely to have saved costs and improved efficiency, in turn, leading to margin expansion. Share buybacks are expected to have provided an additional upside to the bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nPotential Q1 Outperformers\n\nAflac provides supplemental health and life insurance products. Net premiums earned derived from growing cancer insurance sales coupled with cost-cutting initiatives, partly offset by the impact of paid-up policies, are expected to shape its quarterly results. Aflac\u2019s revenues are likely to have benefited from strong contributions from its Japan and U.S. businesses. Improved net premiums earned in both Japan and U.S. businesses are expected to have driven the overall net premiums of Aflac.

AFL has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nAflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAflac Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Aflac Incorporated Quote\n\nAxis Capital Holdings offers a broad range of specialty insurance and reinsurance solutions. AXS\u2019 Insurance segment is likely to have benefited from a diversified portfolio of global specialty businesses, leadership positions and growth opportunities across major business lines. Rate increases in both its Insurance and Reinsurance segments are likely to have benefited the quarter\u2019s performance. An increase in income from fixed maturities portfolio due to higher yields is likely to have favored net investment income. Continued share buyback boosted the bottom line.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXS\u2019 first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.72, suggesting an increase of 15% from the year-ago reported figure. AXS has an Earnings ESP of +1.56% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAxis Capital Holdings Limited Price and EPS Surprise Axis Capital Holdings Limited Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAxis Capital Holdings Limited price-eps-surprise | Axis Capital Holdings Limited Quote\n\nHorace Mann Educators is the largest financial services company serving the U.S. educator market. Niche focus, improving product offerings, better pricing and a strengthened distribution model are likely to benefit first-quarter results. Earned premium growth ahead of loss cost growth is likely to have favored combined ratio. Continued share buybacks are expected to have boosted the bottom line.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HMN\u2019s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 77 cents, suggesting an increase of 234.8% from the year-ago reported figure. HMN has an Earnings ESP of +15.03% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Horace Mann Educators Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nHorace Mann Educators Corporation price-eps-surprise | Horace Mann Educators Corporation Quote\n\nPrimerica is the second-largest issuer of term-life insurance coverage in North America. Solid sales growth, persistency and a strong network of life-licensed sales representatives are likely to aid PRI\u2019s first-quarter results. Sales and policy persistency are likely to have benefited from the strong demand for protection products. Adjusted direct premiums are likely to have been driven by premiums from new sales. An improved interest rate environment is likely to have favored net investment income.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRI\u2019s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.11, suggesting an increase of 17.8% from the year-ago reported figure. PRI has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nPrimerica, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Primerica, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPrimerica, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Primerica, Inc.

        "content": "Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 - In March 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 100.5%, down from 101.2% in February 2024. This marks the third month in a row that the index has declined from its recent high of 102.5% set in December 2023. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nEarlier recovery being reversed as prices for necessity items continue to climb\n\nDULUTH, Ga., April 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, announced today the release of the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122), a monthly index illustrating the purchasing power of middle-income households with income between $30,000 and $130,000. In March 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 100.5%, down from 101.2% in February 2024. This marks the third month in a row that the index has declined from its recent high of 102.5% set in December 2023.\n\nThe decline comes because of the sharp rise in cost of necessity goods, which increased by 1.3% month-over-month since the beginning of the year, driven by a 6.4% increase in gas prices during the same period.\n\nFor more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122, visit www.householdbudgetindex.com.\n\nAbout the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122)\n\nThe Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE\u00ae. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\nThe HBI\u2122 is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI\u2122 uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent \"normal\" economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeriodically, prior HBI\u2122 values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI\u2122 data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI\u2122 data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

        "title": "How Should You Play MetLife (MET) Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "MetLife, Inc. MET is slated to release first-quarter 2024 results on May 1, after market close. Higher premiums, variable investment income and increased volumes across Group Benefits and Latin America units are likely to have worked well for the company, partly undone by rising costs.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nIn the first quarter, revenues of MetLife are expected to have benefited on the back of higher premiums and net investment income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums is pegged at $10.9 billion, which indicates an improvement of 13.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nNet investment income is likely to have been aided by improved variable investment income as a result of higher returns from corporate and mortgage loan funds. The consensus mark for net investment income is $4.9 billion, suggesting a 6.1% growth from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nMost of the segments, barring EMEA, are likely to have contributed favorably to MetLife\u2019s first-quarter\u2019s performance. The EMEA unit is likely to have suffered a roadblock due to less favorable expenses and underwriting margins.\n\nNevertheless, solid contributions by the Group Benefits, Retirement Plan Services (RIS), Asia and Latin America businesses are expected to have driven the overall results of MET. Strong life underwriting margins, increased volumes and a lower Group Life mortality ratio are likely to have driven the performance of the Group Benefits business in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s adjusted revenues is pegged at $6.5 billion, which implies a 1.7% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nRIS\u2019 results are likely to have been aided by improved recurring interest, variable investment income and underwriting margins in the first quarter. The consensus mark for the unit\u2019s adjusted revenues is $3.7 billion, suggesting a 50.5% surge from the year-ago quarter\u2019s number.\n\nMeanwhile, an increase in investment margins and lower taxes are expected to have driven the Asia segment\u2019s performance. Higher general account assets under management are also likely to have contributed to the upside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit\u2019s adjusted revenues is pegged at $2.9 billion, which indicates a 7% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nThe Latin America segment\u2019s quarterly results are likely to have gained on the back of higher volumes, partly offset by less favorable underwriting margins. The consensus mark for the unit\u2019s adjusted revenues is $1.9 billion, suggesting 11.3% growth from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile all these tailwinds can position the stock well for close evaluation, we remain concerned about the escalating trend observed in its overall costs, particularly in the light of several expense management initiatives being undertaken. A higher expense level can affect the profit growth potential of MET and make an earnings beat uncertain.\n\nQ1 Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MET\u2019s first-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.83, which indicates an improvement of 20.4% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is $17.7 billion, suggesting 9.7% growth from the year-ago quarter's actual.\n\nEarnings Surprise History\n\nMetLife\u2019s earnings beat estimates in one of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark thrice, the average negative surprise being 3.76%. This is depicted in the chart below:\n\nMetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMetLife, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MetLife, Inc. Quote\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MetLife this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that\u2019s not the case here, as you see below.\r\n\r\nMetLife has an Earnings ESP of -1.08% and a Zacks Rank of 3.\r\n\r\nYou can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies from the Finance space, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:\n\nVictory Capital Holdings, Inc. VCTR currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for VCTR\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.21 per share, indicating an improvement of 12% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nVictory Capital\u2019s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and matched the mark twice, the average surprise being 1.10%.\r\n\r\nPrimerica, Inc. PRI has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank of 2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRI\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.11 per share, which implies a 17.8% rise from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nPrimerica\u2019s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 3.10%.\n\nHoulihan Lokey, Inc. HLI currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.37% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HLI\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.20 per share, which indicates an improvement of 8.1% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. \r\n\r\nHoulihan Lokey\u2019s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 8.33%.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Primerica (PRI) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "The market expects Primerica (PRI) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis life insurance and financial products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $738.43 million, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.68% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Primerica?\n\nFor Primerica, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.46%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Primerica will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Primerica would post earnings of $4.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.25, delivering a surprise of -0.23%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nPrimerica appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry, Lincoln National (LNC) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -27.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.64 billion, down 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Lincoln National has been revised 4.7% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lincoln National will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Short Seller Targets Primerica Stock Claiming Agents Are Engaged In Deceptive Behavior, Shares Sink\n\nPrimerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) shares have turned lower Thursday after the Bear Cave issued a fresh short report on the stock.\n\nWhat Happened: Short-selling firm the Bear Cave has targeted Primerica stock in a new bearish report claiming the company\u2019s highest-producing agents are engaged in misleading, false, or deceptive behavior.\n\nThe short seller noted Primerica explicitly states that its business model, which involved deploying life insurance-licensed sales representatives to provide financial products and services to middle-income households, was \u201cnot a pyramid scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bear Cave sees things differently,\u201d the short seller said.\n\nBenzinga reached out to Primerica for comment, but has not yet received a response.\n\nThe Bear Cave said it reviewed extensive evidence that suggested Primerica\u2019s agents were engaging in deceptive conduct including a recorded Zoom presentation that appeared to suggest an internal investigation was ongoing. Other evidence included a recruiting script for new agents that appeared to deliberately obfuscate their association with Primerica, agent presentations that emphasize recruiting and more.\n\n\u201cOne text message recruiting script for Primerica agents, obtained by The Bear Cave through online searches, even appears to conceal the role of Primerica and instead instructs recruits to say the company is \u2018PFS Inc,\u2019 potentially so friends and family won't find the voluminous online criticism of Primerica,\u201d the short seller said.\n\nSee Also: Benzinga\u2019s \u2018Stock Whisper\u2019 Index: 5 Stocks Investors Secretly Monitor But Don\u2019t Talk About Yet\n\nBeyond aggressive recruiting, the Bear Cave claimed some top agents also appear concerned about cultural integrity issues at the company, noting that one million dollar earner asked questions about dishonest business practices in a recorded Zoom call from 2023.\n\nThe Bear Cave also said it obtained complaints against Primerica through a public records request filed with the Florida Attorney General's Office.\n\n\u201cPrimerica customers aren't the only ones complaining. Across blogs, Reddit, and YouTube many ex-Primerica agents are sharing their bad Primerica experiences. And on Glassdoor many of the reviews are no better,\u201d the Bear Cave said.\n\nPrimerica had a market cap of approximately $7.34 billion as of Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\nPRI Price Action:Primerica shares were down 8.94% at $192.72 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nThis illustration was generated using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Short Seller Targets Primerica Stock Claiming Agents Are Engaged In Deceptive Behavior, Shares Sink originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Here's Why We Think Primerica (NYSE:PRI) Is Well Worth Watching",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Primerica (NYSE:PRI). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Primerica\n\nHow Quickly Is Primerica Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Primerica has grown EPS by 20% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It's noted that Primerica's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. While we note Primerica achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 3.5% to US$2.9b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Primerica's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\n\nAre Primerica Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Primerica, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$39m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.5%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Primerica with market caps between US$4.0b and US$12b is about US$8.5m.\n\nThe Primerica CEO received total compensation of just US$4.2m in the year to December 2023. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nDoes Primerica Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nYou can't deny that Primerica has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that Primerica is worth keeping an eye on. Even so, be aware that  Primerica is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAlthough Primerica certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Primerica's PRI compelling portfolio, strong market presence, sturdy distribution channel and solid capital position poise it well for growth. These, coupled with optimistic growth projections, make it worth retaining in one\u2019s portfolio.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 7.9% year to date, outperforming 1.7%, 0.4% and 7.6% growth of the industry, the Finance sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite, respectively, in the same period.\u00a0 It has a VGM Score of B.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved 1 cent north in the past seven days, reflecting analysts\u2019 optimism. Primerica envisions being a successful senior health business while continuing to enhance its shareholders\u2019 value.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Primerica\u2019s 2024 earnings is pegged at $17.76 per share, indicating an increase of 10.5% on 5.6% higher revenues of $3 billion.\u00a0 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Primerica\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $19.51 per share, indicating an increase of 9.8% on 4.6% higher revenues of $3.1 billion.\u00a0 Earnings of this second-largest issuer of term-life insurance coverage in North America have risen 17.6% in the last five years, outperforming the industry average of 5.6%.\r\n\r\nReturn on equity (ROE), a profitability measure to identify how efficiently a company is utilizing its shareholders\u2019 funds, has been improving over the last several years. PRI\u2019s trailing 12-month ROE of 27.8% is better than the industry average of 15.4%.\r\n\r\nAlso, the return on invested capital in the trailing 12 months was 7%, better than the industry average of 0.7%, reflecting PRI\u2019s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Drivers\n\nPRI noted that 48% of middle-income Americans will not be ready for retirement based on their investment and savings habits. This is where life-licensed sales representatives will play a major role in capitalizing on the growth opportunities. Management estimates a 3% rise in sales force size in 2024.\r\n\r\nA strong demand for protection products should drive sales growth and policy persistency. A strong business model makes the company well-poised to cater to the middle market's increased demand for financial security.\r\n\r\nBanking on premiums from new sales, PRI estimates adjusted direct premiums to grow 5% to 6% in 2024 at the Term Life segment. Demand should continue to remain strong on the back of its insurance products launched in the fall of 2022.\r\n\r\nLicensed representatives act as catalysts, contributing to the operational results of the insurer. For 2024, the insurer estimates a 3-5% rise in the number of Term Life policies and a 5% rise in Investment and Savings Products sales.\r\n\r\nLife insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving interest rate environment. An improved interest rate environment should aid net investment income.\r\n\r\nApart from having solid liquidity, Primerica has been strengthening its balance sheet by improving its leverage ratio. It scores strongly with credit rating agencies.\r\n\r\nManagement believes that its solid Term-life insurance business ensures consistent free cash flow. Banking on this strength, the board recently approved a $425 million buyback program through next year. This apart, it has been hiking dividends every year since 2010. Dividends increased at a five-year CAGR of 17.1%.\u00a0 Notably, its free cash flow conversion has remained more than 100% over the last many quarters, reflecting its solid earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Employers Holdings EIG, Reinsurance Group of America RGA and Manulife Financial Corporation MFC.\r\n\r\nEmployers Holdings beat estimates in the last four quarters. The stock has gained 8.5% year to date.\u00a0 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EIG\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved 6.6% and 8.8% north, respectively, in the past 60 days.

        "title": "5 Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy in a Volatile April",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets have been retreating in April after a sharp rally in the last 15 months. The euphoria surrounding the first rate cut in the benchmark lending rate in June by the Fed evaporated as the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note returned northward, trading around 4.5%.\n\nThis was primarily due to a sticky inflation rate despite a restrictive monetary policy and an extremely high interest rate regime in the last 24 months. At present, the CME FedWatch shows just a 17% chance of a rate cut in June. The majority of the respondents are now expecting the first reduction of the Fed fund rate to happen in September.\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, as many as 15 Fed officials said that they are in no hurry to initiate a rate cut, though the majority of these officials still believe that at least one rate cut of 25 basis points will happen this year. Market participants are also concerned regarding the visibility of the Fed\u2019s much-hyped \u201csoft landing\u201d of the economy.\n\nWhy Should You Invest in Mid-Cap Stocks?\n\nInvestment in mid-cap stocks is often recognized as a good portfolio diversification strategy. These stocks combine the attractive attributes of both small and large-cap stocks. Top-ranked, mid-cap stocks have a high potential to enhance their profitability, productivity, and market share. These may also become large-caps over time.\n\nIf economic growth slows down due to any unforeseen internal or external disturbance, mid-cap stocks will be less susceptible to losses than their large-cap counterparts owing to less international exposure.\n\nOn the other hand, if the economy continues to thrive, these stocks will gain more than small caps due to established management teams, a broad distribution network, brand recognition and ready access to capital markets.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five mid-caps (market capital > $5 billion, < $10 billion) that have strong potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAllison Transmission Holdings Inc. ALSN achieved record sales in 2023, primarily on robust demand from the North America On-Highway end market. ALSN expects strong results from the unit this year as well. For the full year, Allison Transmission envisions record total sales in the range of $3.05-$3.15 billion, up from $3.03 billion generated in 2023.\n\nThe strategic buyouts of Walker Die, C&R Tool & Engineering, Vantage Power, the Off-Highway transmission portfolio of AVTEC and AxleTech\u2019s electric vehicle system division are set to boost ALSN\u2019s long-term prospects. Regular product launches, including FracTran, TerraTran and the 3414 Regional Haul Series fully automatic transmission, bode well. ALSN\u2019s electric solutions promise growth opportunities.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Allison Transmission has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.1% and 3.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.6% over the past 60 days.\n\nSM Energy Co. SM is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years buoyed by an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. SM Energy has roughly 155,000 net acres in South Texas and operates two drilling rigs and one completion crew. Notably, operating wells in the Austin Chalk allow SM to diversify its portfolio and mitigate risks related to regional demand and supply.\n\nSM Energy expects its total 2024 production to exceed the prior-year figure by 3-4%. As an upstream company, SM is poised to benefit from the ongoing favorable crude price environment. Higher production and better prices are expected to improve SM\u2019s financial performance and aid free cash flow generation.\n\nZacks Rank #1 SM Energy has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5.5% and 2.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the past seven days.\n\nLancaster Colony Corp. LANC is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice markets. LANC\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries, including T. Marzetti Company, produce and market high-quality national and regionally-branded food products throughout the United States for the retail and food service markets.\n\nMost of LANC\u2019s products sold through the retail channel are marketed under its popular brand names, such as Marzetti, New York Brand Bakery, Sister Schubert's and Flatout.

        "title": "NATIONAL SURVEY: Two-Thirds of Middle-Income Americans Feel School Failed Them on Financial Education, with Youngest Most Challenged",
        "content": "Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 - In February 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.2%, slightly down from 101.6% in January 2024. A year ago, the index stood at 95.9%. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\n60% say they are not saving enough for retirement\n\nDULUTH, Ga., April 09, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, released its Financial Security Monitor\u2122 (FSM\u2122) survey for the first quarter of 2024, revealing two-thirds (66%) of middle-income Americans feel their education did not adequately prepare them to manage their finances as adults, with a notable discrepancy across age groups.\n\nA majority of those under age 65 said their financial education fell short, with the youngest age brackets expressing the highest level of dissatisfaction, including 73% of those ages 18-34, 69% of those 35-49, and 65% of ages 50-64. In contrast, a majority (61%) of men over 65 felt their education did a good job preparing them \u2014 the only demographic to believe so \u2014 while a majority (57%) of women in the same age group said the opposite.\n\nSpecifically, most middle-income Americans said schools did not prepare them for tasks such as doing taxes (71%), paying back student loans (67%), taking out and paying back loans (64%), or setting a household budget (59%).\n\n\"We are seeing a clear lack of confidence among middle-income Americans who believe their education failed to prepare them to manage their personal finances, with an overwhelming majority of young people feeling left behind,\" said Glenn J. Williams, CEO of Primerica. \"These are gaps we have to recognize and address as people plan their financial futures and navigate a fluctuating economic environment that, in recent years, has left middle-income Americans feeling incredibly uncertain about their financial situations.\"\n\nThe latest FSM\u2122 survey coincides with the release of Primerica\u2019s Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122), which indicates middle-income households experienced a slight dip in purchasing power after a stronger start to the year, as rising costs for necessities like gas slightly outpaced income gains. The HBI fell to 101.2% in February from 101.6% in January but is still up notably from 95.9% compared to one year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Gas price increases are often immediately felt by middle-income Americans, with a direct impact on their purchasing power with every fill-up. Relative to a year ago, middle-income households are doing a bit better as the prices of most necessities have increased only a small amount and gasoline has come down some while incomes have risen at a faster pace on average than overall inflation,\" said Amy Crews Cutts, Ph.D., CBE\u00ae, economic consultant to Primerica. \"While the slight loss of purchasing power for middle income households from January to February is equivalent to the cost of a fancy coffee drink, it is a reminder that inflation is still troublesome for households trying to keep a budget and plan for their financial future.\"\n\nKey Findings from Primerica\u2019s U.S. Middle-Income Financial Security Monitor\u2122\n\nSchools fall short on financial education, with generational divide. The majority (66%) of middle-income Americans feel the education they received during their upbringing didn't equip them to manage their finances as adults. Nearly half (49%) say that it did not prepare them well at all, with a third (33%) saying it prepared them very or somewhat well. Middle-income Americans are increasingly concerned about credit card debt. More than a third of middle-income Americans (38%) are more concerned about their credit card debt compared to a year ago. A majority who feel this way also report spending less overall (71%, up 9 points since December 2023), and some say they are looking at additional income sources (32%, up 6 points) or debt consolidation (16%, also up 6 points). Most middle-income Americans merge finances with their partner after marriage. About three-quarters (73%) of married Americans merge their finances with their partners, a fifth (20%) keep their finances separate from their partner, and less than a tenth (7%) say they do something else. Of note, college-educated women show a higher tendency to keep their finances separate from their partners (64% merge, 21% separate, 15% something else). Middle-income Americans are saving less for retirement. The percentage of people putting less money into their retirement accounts has increased 7 points over the past two years even as 60% do not believe they are saving enough to retire comfortably. Rising cost of necessities remains an issue. Most middle-income Americans (88%) say recent increases in food prices have impacted them and their family. Individuals report having to buy cheaper options for similar products (68%), buy less food (54%), change their eating habits (48%), use coupons more frequently (37%), and buy more in bulk (30%).\n\nPrimerica Financial Security Monitor\u2122 (FSM\u2122) Topline Trends Data\n\nMar.\n\n2024 Dec.\n\n2023 Sept.\n\n2023 Jun.\n\n2023 Mar.\r\n2023 Dec.\n\n2022 Sep.\n\n2022 Jun.\r\n2022 Mar.\n\n2022 How would you rate the condition of your personal finances?

Polling was conducted online from March 6-11, 2024. Using Dynamic Online Sampling, Change Research polled 1,312 adults nationwide with incomes between $30,000 and $130,000. Post-stratification weights were made on gender, age, race, education and Census region to reflect the population of these adults based on the five-year averages in the 2021 American Community Survey, published by the U.S. Census. The margin of error is 3.0%. For more information visit Primerica.com/public/financial-security-monitor.html.\n\nAbout the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122)\n\nThe Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE\u00ae. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\nThe HBI\u2122 is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI\u2122 uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent \"normal\" economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeriodically, prior HBI\u2122 values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI\u2122 data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI\u2122 data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

        "content": "Manulife Financial Corporation MFC shares have rallied 10.6% year to date, outperforming the industry\u2019s increase of 7.4%, the Finance sector\u2019s increase of 7.4% and the S&P 500 Composite\u2019s gain of\u00a0 7.4%. With a market capitalization of $44.4 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 3.4 million.\r\n\r\nThe strength of its Asia business, expanding Wealth and Asset Management business and solid capital position continue to drive this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) life insurer. MFC, one of the three dominant life insurers within the domestic Canadian market, has delivered an earnings surprise in the last five quarters.\r\n\r\nManulife\u2019s return on equity (ROE) for the trailing 12 months is 16%, better than the industry\u2019s average of 15.4%. This reflects Manulife\u2019s efficiency in utilizing shareholders\u2019 funds. It targets 13% ROE over the medium term. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Drivers\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings per share (EPS) is $2.71 and $2.97, respectively, suggesting an increase of 5.5% and 9.7%.\r\n\r\nWhile earnings have grown 4.9% over the last five years, the long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 10%. Manulife targets core EPS growth between 10% and 12% over the medium term.\r\n\r\nManulife\u2019s Asia business plays a crucial part in its long-term growth and targets it to account for half of the company\u2019s core earnings by 2025. The insurer is continually scaling up its business across Asia. We believe MFC is well-poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities of the Asia market by banking on its strategic initiatives.\r\n\r\nManulife is expanding its Wealth and Asset Management business and has identified Europe and the wider EMEA market as a significant growth area. It is continually making long-term investments in this region.\r\n\r\nMFC has been accelerating growth in the highest potential businesses and targets two-thirds of core earnings from these businesses. Its inorganic growth is impressive as this life insurer prudently deploys capital in high-growth, less capital-intensive and higher-return businesses.\r\n\r\nThe insurance industry is undergoing accelerated digitalization. In sync with the industry trend, Manulife is continually building on its digital platform as well as accelerating the adoption of new technologies such as generative AI.\r\n\r\nA sturdy capital position helps MFC distribute wealth to investors as dividends. The insurer has increased its dividend at a six-year CAGR of 10% and targets a 35-45% dividend payout over the medium term.\r\n\r\nMFC is strengthening its balance sheet and thus targets a leverage ratio of 25%. Notably, its free cash flow conversion has remained more than 100% over the last many quarters, reflecting its solid earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAttractive Valuation\n\nThe company\u2019s shares are trading at a price-to-book multiple of 1.42, lower than the industry average of 1.84. Before valuation expands, it is wise to take a position in the stock.\r\n\r\nThis insurer has a Value Score of A, reflecting an attractive valuation.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks from the insurance space are Sun Life Financial SLF, Primerica PRI and Assurant Inc. AIZ. Each stock presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SLF\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings indicates an 8.1% and 6.4% year-over-year increase, respectively.\r\n\r\nPrimerica delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.10%. The stock has gained 21% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRI\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings translates to a 10.5% and 10% year-over-year increase, respectively.\r\n\r\nAssurant delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 42.15%.

        "content": "Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated\u2019s RGA shares have rallied 43.3% in a year compared with the industry's growth of 30.7%. The Finance sector and the Zacks S&P 500 index have gained 26.1% and 27.7% in the said time frame, respectively. With a market capitalization of $12.68 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.3 million. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe rally was largely driven by new business volumes, favorable longevity experience, stronger invested asset base, business expansion in the pension risk transfer market and effective capital deployment.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) life insurer delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 24.39%.\r\n\r\nReinsurance Group has a VGM Score of B. The VGM Score helps identify stocks with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum.\n\nWill the Bull Run Continue?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reinsurance Group\u2019s 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 8.8% from the consensus estimate of 2024. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $20.04 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 5.5% from the consensus mark of 2024.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved 0.4% and 0.2% north, respectively, in the past 30 days, reflecting analysts\u2019 optimism on the stock.\r\n\r\nIts compelling product portfolio and operational expertise help Reinsurance Group maintain its leadership position in the United States, Latin America and Canada.\r\n\r\nSignificant value embedded in the in-force business helps generate predictable long-term earnings. Product line expansion not only contributes to risk diversification and matured individual mortality but also provides a base for stable earnings and capital generation.\r\n\r\nReinsurance Group\u2019s longevity insurance provides a source of diversified income and acts as a hedge to a large mortality position. Increasing demand for longevity insurance poises it well for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nLife insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving interest rate environment. Though the Fed has stalled rate increases for some time, it has already made 11 hikes since 2022.\r\n\r\nA high-quality investment portfolio and the company\u2019s diversified business across asset classes, sectors, issuers and geography are positives.\r\nRGA\u2019s solid capital position with excess capital of around $1 billion offers sufficient financial flexibility and supports effective capital deployment.\r\n\r\nReinsurance Group expects to remain active in deploying capital into attractive growth opportunities in organic flow and in-force block transactions and returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On Jan 23, 2024, the company\u2019s board authorized a share repurchase program for up to $500 million of RGA\u2019s outstanding common stock.\r\n\r\nROE is a profitability metric that measures how effectively the company is utilizing its shareholders' funds. In the fourth quarter of 2023, adjusted operating return on equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income) was 14.5%, which expanded 400 basis points year over year. This shows the company\u2019s relative efficiency in managing shareholders\u2019 funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the life insurance industry are Manulife Financial Corp.

        "title": "5 Top Stocks Worth a Buy for Solid Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Irrespective of whether it is a start-up or a well-known company, earnings growth is the top priority for any organization. This is because if the company doesn\u2019t make money, it won\u2019t survive.\n\nSo, what\u2019s earnings growth? Study a company\u2019s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings play a striking role.\n\nNonetheless, stocks such as Volvo VLVLY, Dycom Industries DY, NVIDIA NVDA, Sitio Royalties Corp. STR and Primerica PRI are currently exhibiting superb earnings growth.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company\u2019s earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts\u2019 opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nScreening Measures:\n\nTo shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)\n\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).\n\nStory continues\n\n% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).\n\n% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\nThe above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 5. Here are the stocks:\n\nVolvo is a manufacturer of trucks, buses, and construction equipment. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). VLVLY\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 16.7%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nDycom Industries is a specialty contracting firm operating in the telecom industry. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. DY\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 23.8%.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit. The company has a Zacks Rank #1. NVDA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 30.9%.\n\nSitio Royalties owns and manages mineral and royalty interests across premium basins. The company has a Zacks Rank #1. STR\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 17.8%.\n\nPrimerica provides financial products and services. The company has a Zacks Rank #2.

        "content": "Sun Life Financial\u2019s SLF focus on Asia operations, its strengthening asset management businesses, the scale-up of its U.S. operations and a strong financial position bode well for growth.\n\nEarnings Surprise History\n\nSun Life has a decent track record of beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters while meeting once, the average being 3.32%.\n\nNorthbound Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved 20% and 2% north, respectively, in the past 60 days, reflecting analyst optimism.\n\nZacks Rank & Price Performance\n\nSun Life currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the past year, the stock has gained 18.9% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 31.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOptimistic Growth Projections\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sun Life\u2019s 2024 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 8% from the consensus estimate of 2023.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 7.3% from the consensus estimate of 2024.\n\nBusiness Tailwinds\n\nSun Life is strengthening its presence in the Asia market, which provides higher returns and growth than the North American markets. The contribution of Asia to Sun Life\u2019s earnings has increased to 21% from 8% over the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe third largest insurer in Canada is improving its business mix and is thus shifting its growth focus toward products that block lower capital and offer more predictable earnings. Sun Life looks to be one of the top five players and remains focused on growing its voluntary benefits business.\r\n\r\nIn its effort to strengthen Asset Management, Sun Life Investment Management makes investments in private fixed-income, mortgages and real estate. It invests in pension plans and other institutional investors. Notably, Asset Management provides a higher return on equity, lower capital and volatility and has the potential for an earnings upside.\r\n\r\nOperational efficiency has been aiding Sun Life in building a strong capital position. The life insurer\u2019s capital outlay includes a 40-50% dividend payout over the medium term. Also, given the company\u2019s ongoing shift to fee-based capital-light businesses, it reiterated its medium-term ROE target of 18%.\r\n\r\nSLF also has Value Score of A. This style score helps find the most attractive value stocks. Back-tested results have shown that stocks with a Value Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 are best investment bets.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Manulife Financial Corporation MFC, Primerica Inc. PRI and Axis Capital Holdings Limited AXS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nManulife delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.01%. In the past year, MFC shares have gained 35.6%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 5.4% and 9.7%, respectively, from the consensus estimate of the corresponding years.\r\n\r\nPrimerica delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.1%. In the past year, PRI shares have gained 52.7%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRI\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 10.4% and 10%, respectively, from the consensus estimate of the corresponding years.\r\n\r\nAxis Capital has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 102.57%. In the past year, AXS has gained 19.2%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXS\u2019 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 3% and 10%, respectively, from the consensus estimate of the corresponding years.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 - In February 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.2%, slightly down from 101.6% in January 2024. A year ago, the index stood at 95.9%. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nDULUTH, Ga., March 27, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, announced today the release of the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122), a monthly index illustrating the purchasing power of middle-income households with income between $30,000 and $130,000. In February 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.2%, slightly down from 101.6% in January 2024. The fast rise in gas prices, a 4.3% increase since the beginning of the year, impacted purchasing power for middle-income families in February. A year ago, the index stood at 95.9%.\n\nHBI\u2122 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The index baseline is set at January 2019 and can be thought of as when middle-income households set a budget based on their earned income at that time. Between 2014 and 2020, the HBI\u2122 results recorded steady gains in purchasing power for middle-income families, with a peak of 105.1% in November 2020. This means that relative to January 2019, households were in a stronger financial position to pay their monthly bills because wage growth outpaced the cost of everyday goods. Increasing inflation then caused the index to plummet. In June 2022, it reached a post-pandemic low of 86.7%. Since May 2021, when the HBI\u2122 dipped below 100% for the first time since the pandemic, the average middle-income household has cumulatively spent around $2,425 more than budget on basic necessities. In line with this, if the pandemic and ensuing inflation would not have been a factor, the HBI\u2122 today would be closer to 110%.\n\nFor more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122, visit www.householdbudgetindex.com.\n\nAbout the Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122)\n\nThe Primerica Household Budget Index\u2122 (HBI\u2122) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE\u00ae. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe HBI\u2122 is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI\u2122 uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent \"normal\" economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeriodically, prior HBI\u2122 values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI\u2122 data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI\u2122 data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

        "title": "Boasting A 28% Return On Equity, Is Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) A Top Quality Stock?",
        "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Primerica\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Primerica is:\n\n28% = US$577m \u00f7 US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit.\n\nDoes Primerica Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Primerica has a superior ROE than the average (13%) in the Insurance industry. roe\n\nThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Primerica by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Primerica's Debt And Its 28% Return On Equity\n\nPrimerica does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.01. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

        "title": "What Makes Primerica (PRI) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Primerica (PRI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Primerica currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if PRI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this life insurance and financial products company holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor PRI, shares are up 1.4% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.88% compares favorably with the industry's 2.23% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Primerica have risen 17.78%, and are up 31.39% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.77% and 30%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to PRI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PRI is currently averaging 127,960 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PRI.\n\nOver the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PRI's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.57 to $17.75 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PRI is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Primerica on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "An In-depth Look at Primerica Inc's Dividend Sustainability and Growth\n\nPrimerica Inc (NYSE:PRI) recently announced a dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on 2024-03-12, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-20. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Primerica Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.\n\nWhat Does Primerica Inc Do?\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CMSQY. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nPrimerica Inc is a provider of financial services to middle-income households in the United States and Canada. The company offers life insurance, mutual funds, annuities, and other financial products, distributed primarily on behalf of third parties. Primerica has three main subsidiaries: Primerica Financial Services, a marketing company; Primerica Life Insurance Company, a principal life insurance underwriting entity; and PFS Investments, which offers investment and savings products, brokerage services, and registered investment advisory. It has four segments: Term Life Insurance; Investment and Savings Products; Senior Health; and Corporate and Other Distributed Products. Geographically, it derives a majority of its revenue from the US. Primerica Inc's Dividend Analysis\n\nA Glimpse at Primerica Inc's Dividend History\n\nPrimerica Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2010. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Primerica Inc has increased its dividend each year since 2010. The stock is thus listed as a dividend achiever, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 14 years. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.\n\nBreaking Down Primerica Inc's Dividend Yield and Growth\n\nAs of today, Primerica Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.05% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.22%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past three years, Primerica Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 17.40%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 23.00% per year. And over the past decade, Primerica Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 22.50%. Based on Primerica Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Primerica Inc stock as of today is approximately 2.96%. Primerica Inc's Dividend Analysis\n\nThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Primerica Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.16.\n\nPrimerica Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Primerica Inc's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.\n\nGrowth Metrics: The Future Outlook\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Primerica Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.\n\nRevenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Primerica Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Primerica Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 13.70% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 80.31% of global competitors.\n\nThe company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Primerica Inc's earnings increased by approximately 8.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 60.16% of global competitors.\n\nLastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 9.30%, which outperforms approximately 62.33% of global competitors.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIn conclusion, Primerica Inc's track record of consistent dividend payments, coupled with its strong dividend growth rate, signals a robust dividend policy. The company's low payout ratio and high profitability rank suggest that the dividends are well-covered by earnings, providing a layer of safety for investors. Furthermore, Primerica Inc's solid growth metrics indicate a promising future, which could potentially lead to continued dividend increases. These factors make Primerica Inc an attractive option for value investors seeking steady income streams with the potential for growth. Will Primerica Inc continue its streak of dividend hikes, and how might future financial performance influence its dividend strategy? These are questions value investors may ponder as they consider adding PRI to their portfolios.\n\nGuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) Just Reported Yearly Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?",
        "content": "It's been a good week for Primerica, Inc. (NYSE:PRI) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest yearly results, and the shares gained 3.8% to US$245. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$2.8b and statutory earnings per share of US$15.94. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Primerica  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the five analysts covering Primerica are now predicting revenues of US$2.94b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a credible 4.4% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to accumulate 8.5% to US$17.86. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$2.97b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$17.83 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$231, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Primerica, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$275 and the most bearish at US$204 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Primerica's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 4.4% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 8.7% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.0% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Primerica is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$231, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Primerica going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou still need to take note of risks, for example - Primerica has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The ongoing need for the financial solutions we provide is clear and our sales force is uniquely positioned to reach and serve middle-income families. Now more than ever, our clients need the education and guidance provided by our representatives to navigate economic uncertainty and manage the financial pressures associated with a higher cost of living. Starting with the highlights of our financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted net operating income increased 4% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted operating income per share increased 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a full year basis, adjusted net operating income increased 8% and adjusted operating income per share rose 15%. In addition, we maintained our commitment to returning capital to stockholders, including the completion of our previously announced $375 million stock repurchase authorization and payment of a total of $94 million in quarterly stockholder dividends. Taking into consideration the complementary nature of our insurance and investment businesses and the predictability of cash flows, the Board approved a new $425 million share repurchase program in November 2023 to occur through December 31, 2024. The Board has also declared a 15% increase to our next quarterly dividend, bringing the payment to $0.75 per share. Over the last few years, we've become more focused on communicating the attractiveness of our entrepreneurial business opportunity and we continue to enhance our processes to keep new recruits engaged.\n\nThere's also greater flexibility and more options for new recruits, who are preparing for their licensing exams. The fundamentals of our business are sound, and we are well positioned for the future. Looking more closely at our distribution progress, during the fourth quarter, we recruited nearly 90,000 individuals, a 17% increase compared to the prior year period. We also saw a 17% increase in licensing with 13,000 reps obtaining a new life license, helping fuel 5% growth in the size of the sales force to end the year with a total of 141,572 life-licensed representatives. Our momentum has continued into the new year as we see a high degree of interest in our business opportunity. These dynamics are leading us to project around 3% growth in the size of the sales force during 2024.\n\nTurning next to sales results. We continue to see strong demand in our Term Life business following the launch of our new insurance products in the fall of 2022. The simple and convenient application process has increased rep confidence, while advancements in underwriting technology allow us to issue policies more rapidly. The increase in the number of rate classes often appeals to clients across a broader spectrum of face amount. During the fourth quarter, we issued almost 89,000 new Term Life policies or 12% more than the adjusted policy count in the same quarter in 2022 for an annual total of nearly 359,000 new policies issued. This represents an 8% increase over adjusted 2022 figures. In 2023, we issued a record $119 billion in new Term Life protection for our clients, a 15% increase compared to the prior year, bringing Primerica's total amount of coverage in force to $945 billion.\n\nWe believe we will continue to benefit from the positive response to our new insurance products during 2024. Based on our current projections, we anticipate full year growth in the number of policies issued to be around 3% to 5%. Turning next to our Investment and Savings Products business. Total sales of $2.4 billion during the quarter increased 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by a combination of strong demand for U.S. mutual funds and variable annuities. In addition, sales volume increased in managed accounts as activity resumed following a brief period of adjustment due to a platform conversion in the third quarter. Net client inflows in the fourth quarter of $172 million reflected normal levels of client redemptions as a percentage of client asset values.\n\nEnding client asset values benefited from strong equity market appreciation in 2023, ending the year at $97 billion, up 15% versus December 31, 2022. We've continued to see ISP sales growth during the start of 2024. We're mindful of the continued economic uncertainty and the impact that a higher cost of living has on middle-income families. We are projecting an increase of approximately 5% in ISP sales during 2024. As we turn to our Senior Health Business, we continue to take a deliberate approach to building the business as we evaluate its progress. Looking at the results for the fourth quarter, LTVs were $1,109 per approved policy, up $221 year-over-year which includes the reclass of $182 per policy for marketing development funds that were previously captured in the other revenues line. A young professional woman holding a laptop, discussing health insurance plans at her desk.\n\nThe reclass of marketing and development funds is a result of changes in our carrier contracts. Our current challenge is sales volume. With fourth quarter total submitted policies down 17% year-over-year due to fewer tenured e-TeleQuote agents entering AEP. Referral activity from Primerica representatives accounted for approximately 25% of submitted policies. Lower productivity by untenured ETQ agents led to a 22% increase in CAC to $878 per approved policy during the fourth quarter of 2023. The LTV to CAC ratio was 1.3. The new leadership team at e-TeleQuote is now at full strength and focused on increasing the percentage of tenured agents while managing the cost structure to improve the LTV to CAC ratio. In closing, let me provide a few observations about our upcoming convention.\n\nThis summer, we returned to the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, and our team is already working hard to ensure another successful event. We had a solid turnout coming out of the pandemic at our 2022 convention, and we expect to see an even larger group at this year's event. The magnitude of this event provides the perfect platform to cast a clear vision for the future to the entire Primerica team. The speakers serve as coaches, motivating and unifying the sales force toward a common goal of growing the business and the event creates a unique opportunity to recognize and celebrate past accomplishments while renewing commitments for future success. In the month leading up to the event, field leaders are pushing teammates to stretch for the finish line and earn an opportunity to be recognized as a top performer.\n\nFollowing the event, we reinforce our vision with additional messaging to drive activity and sustain momentum well beyond the convention itself. Before turning the call over to Tracy, I want to congratulate her on officially taking over as CFO in December. I'm proud to say that the transition has been seamless. I also want to thank Alison for her tremendous contributions to Primerica. The entire team wishes her the best in retirement, which becomes effective April 1. Now I'll hand it over to Tracy to review our financial results.\n\nTracy Tan: Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks today, I will review fourth quarter results and provide an outlook on key financial measures for 2024. In the Term Life segment, pretax operating income of $140 million, increased 6% during the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by 6% higher adjusted direct premium. Pretax operating margin at 22.6% remained unchanged comparing to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting stability and predictability of our results under LDTI reporting. Looking more closely at our key financial ratios. The fourth quarter benefit and claims ratio was 58.2% versus 57.8% in the prior year period and largely in line with our expectations of around 58%. The DAC amortization ratio was essentially unchanged year-over-year at 12% versus 11.9% in the same period of the prior year.\n\nFinally, the insurance expense ratio was 7.1%, compared to 7.8% from the prior year period due to additional expenses associated with the launch of our new insurance product in 2022. Mortality remains generally in line with expectations. However, we continue to see higher lapses across multiple durations, which leads us to think that recent economic pressures are putting financial stress on middle income family. The persistency of policies issued last year under the same economic conditions as today are largely in line with historical trends. As we look ahead, we expect ADP to grow around 5% to 6% in 2024, reflecting the compounding of premiums from new sales. Our estimate also take into consideration elevated lapse rates and the fading benefit from the IPO co-insured block.\n\nLooking at our key financial ratios. We expect the benefits and claims ratio and the DAC amortization ratio to remain stable in 2024 at around 58% and 12%, respectively. We expect the 2024 pretax operating margin to be around 22%, keeping in mind that there is some seasonality in insurance expenses, which can result in some variability to the pretax margin between quarters. Turning next to the results of our ISP segment. Fourth quarter operating revenue of $222 million and pretax operating income of $63 million, increased 12% and 11%, respectively. Our sales force delivered good revenue growth, while equity market appreciation pushed average client asset values higher. Sales-based revenue increased 15%, while commission expense was up 13%, in line with the revenue generating sales growth.\n\nAsset-based revenue grew 12% while average client asset values rose 9%. We continue to see growth in U.S. managed accounts, as well as higher asset levels in Canadian mutual funds in the PD model on which we earn asset-based fees in view of upfront sales commission. Asset-based commission expenses increased in line with related revenue. Based on the 5% sales projection Glenn provided earlier, we estimate sales-based revenue less commissions to increase between $4 million to $5 million in 2024. As a good rule of thumb, on an annual basis, every $1 billion change in average client asset value translates to around $2 million change in asset-based revenue less commission and associated operating expenses. Turning next to Senior Health segment. I will focus on the financial results for the quarter since Glenn has already discussed most of the business dynamics.\n\nThe segment incurred a $2.7 million pretax operating loss, compared to pretax income of $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, driven by lower sales volume and higher cost of acquisition due to lower productivity from a higher mix of less tenured agents. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate an operating loss out by smaller than prior year, as we continue to work towards improving business fundamentals. Meanwhile, we do not expect the need for capital infusion in 2024. The C&O segment recorded a pretax adjusted operating loss of $5.4 million versus a loss of $8.8 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement is due to $7.5 million of higher adjusted net investment income as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on both new investments and cash balances, partially offsetting this was higher benefits and claims costs, mainly due to a onetime $3.3 million adjustment to the ceded reserve for a closed block of non-term life insurance business.\n\nOur invested asset portfolio ended the year with a net unrealized loss of $216 million versus a net unrealized loss of $343 million at the end of September as interest rates fell and credit spreads tightened with which listed bond market. We continue to believe that remaining unrealized loss is a function of interest rates and not due to underlying credit concerns, and we have intense and ability to hold these investments until maturity. The portfolio continues to be well diversified and high quality with an average rating of 8. Finally, consolidated insurance and other operating expenses were $139 million during the fourth quarter, up 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The prior year period included elevated costs associated with the launch of the new Term Life insurance product.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect insurance and other operating expenses to increase by around $40 million or 6% to 8% in 2024. This includes $13 million of higher staffing-related costs, $17 million to support growth in the business and $10 million for ongoing technology initiatives. We expect Term Life, ISP and C&O to each incur about one-third of the year-over-year increase. With that, operator, I open the line for questions.\n\nSee also 25 Fastest-Growing Cities in the South and 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

Primerica's strong performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2023 reflects the power of our distribution. The ongoing need for the financial solutions we provide is clear and our sales force is uniquely positioned to reach and serve middle-income families. Now more than ever, our clients need the education and guidance provided by our representatives to navigate economic uncertainty and manage the financial pressures associated with a higher cost of living. \r\nStarting with the highlights of our financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted net operating income increased 4% compared to the prior year period, while adjusted operating income per share increased 9%. On a full year basis, adjusted net operating income increased 8% and adjusted operating income per share rose 15%. \r\nIn addition, we maintained our commitment to returning capital to stockholders, including the completion of our previously announced $375 million stock repurchase authorization and payment of a total of $94 million in quarterly stockholder dividends. Taking into consideration the complementary nature of our insurance and investment businesses and the predictability of cash flows, the Board approved a new $425 million share repurchase program in November 2023 to occur through December 31, 2024. \r\nThe Board has also declared a 15% increase to our next quarterly dividend, bringing the payment to $0.75 per share. Over the last few years, we've become more focused on communicating the attractiveness of our entrepreneurial business opportunity and we continue to enhance our processes to keep new recruits engaged. There's also greater flexibility and more options for new recruits, who are preparing for their licensing exams. The fundamentals of our business are sound, and we are well positioned for the future. \r\nLooking more closely at our distribution progress, during the fourth quarter, we recruited nearly 90,000 individuals, a 17% increase compared to the prior year period. We also saw a 17% increase in licensing with 13,000 reps obtaining a new life license, helping fuel 5% growth in the size of the sales force to end the year with a total of 141,572 life-licensed representatives. Our momentum has continued into the new year as we see a high degree of interest in our business opportunity. These dynamics are leading us to project around 3% growth in the size of the sales force during 2024. \r\nTurning next to sales results. We continue to see strong demand in our Term Life business following the launch of our new insurance products in the fall of 2022. The simple and convenient application process has increased rep confidence, while advancements in underwriting technology allow us to issue policies more rapidly. The increase in the number of rate classes often appeals to clients across a broader spectrum of face amount. \r\nDuring the fourth quarter, we issued almost 89,000 new Term Life policies or 12% more than the adjusted policy count in the same quarter in 2022 for an annual total of nearly 359,000 new policies issued. This represents an 8% increase over adjusted 2022 figures. In 2023, we issued a record $119 billion in new Term Life protection for our clients, a 15% increase compared to the prior year, bringing Primerica's total amount of coverage in force to $945 billion. \r\nWe believe we will continue to benefit from the positive response to our new insurance products during 2024. Based on our current projections, we anticipate full year growth in the number of policies issued to be around 3% to 5%. \r\nTurning next to our Investment and Savings Products business. Total sales of $2.4 billion during the quarter increased 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by a combination of strong demand for U.S. mutual funds and variable annuities. In addition, sales volume increased in managed accounts as activity resumed following a brief period of adjustment due to a platform conversion in the third quarter. Net client inflows in the fourth quarter of $172 million reflected normal levels of client redemptions as a percentage of client asset values. Ending client asset values benefited from strong equity market appreciation in 2023, ending the year at $97 billion, up 15% versus December 31, 2022. \r\nWe've continued to see ISP sales growth during the start of 2024. We're mindful of the continued economic uncertainty and the impact that a higher cost of living has on middle-income families. We are projecting an increase of approximately 5% in ISP sales during 2024.\r\nAs we turn to our Senior Health Business, we continue to take a deliberate approach to building the business as we evaluate its progress. Looking at the results for the fourth quarter, LTVs were $1,109 per approved policy, up $221 year-over-year which includes the reclass of $182 per policy for marketing development funds that were previously captured in the other revenues line. The reclass of marketing and development funds is a result of changes in our carrier contracts. \r\nOur current challenge is sales volume. With fourth quarter total submitted policies down 17% year-over-year due to fewer tenured e-TeleQuote agents entering AEP. Referral activity from Primerica representatives accounted for approximately 25% of submitted policies. Lower productivity by untenured ETQ agents led to a 22% increase in CAC to $878 per approved policy during the fourth quarter of 2023. The LTV to CAC ratio was 1.3. The new leadership team at e-TeleQuote is now at full strength and focused on increasing the percentage of tenured agents while managing the cost structure to improve the LTV to CAC ratio. \r\nIn closing, let me provide a few observations about our upcoming convention.

Good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks today, I will review fourth quarter results and provide an outlook on key financial measures for 2024. In the Term Life segment, pretax operating income of $140 million, increased 6% during the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by 6% higher adjusted direct premium. Pretax operating margin at 22.6% remained unchanged comparing to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting stability and predictability of our results under LDTI reporting. \r\nLooking more closely at our key financial ratios. The fourth quarter benefit and claims ratio was 58.2% versus 57.8% in the prior year period and largely in line with our expectations of around 58%. The DAC amortization ratio was essentially unchanged year-over-year at 12% versus 11.9% in the same period of the prior year. \r\nFinally, the insurance expense ratio was 7.1%, compared to 7.8% from the prior year period due to additional expenses associated with the launch of our new insurance product in 2022. Mortality remains generally in line with expectations. However, we continue to see higher lapses across multiple durations, which leads us to think that recent economic pressures are putting financial stress on middle income family. The persistency of policies issued last year under the same economic conditions as today are largely in line with historical trends. \r\nAs we look ahead, we expect ADP to grow around 5% to 6% in 2024, reflecting the compounding of premiums from new sales. Our estimate also take into consideration elevated lapse rates and the fading benefit from the IPO coinsured block. \r\nLooking at our key financial ratios. We expect the benefits and claims ratio and the DAC amortization ratio to remain stable in 2024 at around 58% and 12%, respectively. We expect the 2024 pretax operating margin to be around 22%, keeping in mind that there is some seasonality in insurance expenses, which can result in some variability to the pretax margin between quarters. \r\nTurning next to the results of our ISP segment. Fourth quarter operating revenue of $222 million and pretax operating income of $63 million, increased 12% and 11%, respectively. Our sales force delivered good revenue growth, while equity market appreciation pushed average client asset values higher. Sales-based revenue increased 15%, while commission expense was up 13%, in line with the revenue generating sales growth. Asset-based revenue grew 12% while average client asset values rose 9%. We continue to see growth in U.S. managed accounts as well as higher asset levels in Canadian mutual funds in the PD model on which we earn asset-based fees in view of upfront sales commission. \r\nAsset-based commission expenses increased in line with related revenue. Based on the 5% sales projection Glenn provided earlier, we estimate sales-based revenue less commissions to increase between $4 million to $5 million in 2024. As a good rule of thumb, on an annual basis, every $1 billion change in average client asset value translates to around $2 million change in asset-based revenue less commission and associated operating expenses. \r\nTurning next to Senior Health segment. I will focus on the financial results for the quarter since Glenn has already discussed most of the business dynamics. The segment incurred a $2.7 million pretax operating loss, compared to pretax income of $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, driven by lower sales volume and higher cost of acquisition due to lower productivity from a higher mix of less tenured agents. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate an operating loss out by smaller than prior year, as we continue to work towards improving business fundamentals. Meanwhile, we do not expect the need for capital infusion in 2024. \r\nThe C&O segment recorded a pretax adjusted operating loss of $5.4 million versus a loss of $8.8 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement is due to $7.5 million of higher adjusted net investment income as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on both new investments and cash balances, partially offsetting this was higher benefits and claims costs, mainly due to a onetime $3.3 million adjustment to the ceded reserve for a closed block of non-term life insurance business. \r\nOur invested asset portfolio ended the year with a net unrealized loss of $216 million versus a net unrealized loss of $343 million at the end of September as interest rates fell and credit spreads tightened with which listed bond market. We continue to believe that remaining unrealized loss is a function of interest rates and not due to underlying credit concerns, and we have intense and ability to hold these investments until maturity. The portfolio continues to be well diversified and high quality with an average rating of 8. \r\nFinally, consolidated insurance and other operating expenses were $139 million during the fourth quarter, up 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The prior year period included elevated costs associated with the launch of the new Term Life insurance product. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect insurance and other operating expenses to increase by around $40 million or 6% to 8% in 2024. This includes $13 million of higher staffing-related costs, $17 million to support growth in the business and $10 million for ongoing technology initiatives. We expect Term Life, ISP and C&O to each incur about 1/3 of the year-over-year increase. \r\nWith that, operator, I open the line for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities.\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nTracy, the $40 million increase on the base of $142 million. Am I seeing that properly? And if so, how much of that is related to the conference?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nCan you say that again?\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nYes. The $40 million increase in expenses, is that on the base of $142 million?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nYes.\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nAnd then how much of that is related to the conference?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nThe conference. Okay. So what I would say is overall, the conference is just one of the sales events and on a year-over-year basis, just to ensure, I give you the overall big picture, the expenses on these activities are -- we strive to keep them pretty even year-over-year, specifically conference. Specifically, conference is one of the 2 events that we hold per year. In terms of dollars, we have about $13 million for the event.\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nMark, I would add to that. We met some of that against the registration fees and so forth. So our convention is designed to cost us after registration fees about the same as one of our leadership events or incentive trips as we call them, so that's why we do 2 incentives in 1 year and then we'll do a convention in 1 incentive the next year. So the convention is designed to roughly equate to the trip that we don't do in a convention year.\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nOkay. Does this seem relatively elevated, again, $40 million on $142 million is the meaningful increase?\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nMark, you're coming through a little garble. Would you mind asking that one more time? I'm sorry.\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nYes. I apologize. I was just remarking that the $40 million on the base of $142 million seems like a meaningful increase. Is that -- were there more growth initiatives or step function and staffing this year that contributes to that?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nYes, Mark, I would say that the increase year-over-year seems higher on a percentage base compared to 2023 versus 2024. If that's what you're comparing that, you would notice that 2023 comparison to 2022 was actually lower than typical because of 2022 spend being elevated for 2 reasons. One, in 2022, we had 3 sales leadership events compared to typical 2. And then secondly, we had the elevated expense for launch of new products for Term Life, and that also increased the spend. So if you're comparing historical 23% to 24%, it's going to look a little bit higher. \r\nAlso in 2024, we're going to continue to invest for business growth, which is why you see that in the breakdown the biggest number increase, $17 million, is supporting the business growth. Some of that will go to continued investment of technology initiatives that we will certainly continue to improve for infrastructure, for productivity to support our sales force and our top line growth.\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nVery good. And one more, if I might. The Senior Health profit, I think, or the loss you said would be smaller than the prior year. Could that be consistent through the quarter or quarters, which is to say, consistently lower losses in each quarter? Or will it be -- will it vary?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nYes, Mark, that's a great question. There is some seasonality in the Senior Health business. In a typical year, you would see the fourth quarter being the most profitable because of the AEP and the volume, followed by the first quarter. And then second and third quarter would have higher expenses because of the hiring and preparing for the AEP season. That's a typical year. \r\nNow what I would say is coming out of fourth quarter of 2023 with a weaker AEP, the renewal season with the following activity of cash flow coming through, it will take us a little bit of time to analyze gather the information, which we'll share next quarter. But overall, I would say that we expect to have a smaller loss than prior year, and we would have a lot more to share next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.\n\nRyan Joel Krueger\n\nMy first question was on lapses. Could you provide some additional color on how much higher lapses are trending relative to your longer-term expectations or trends? And any more color you can provide, as I think you have in past quarters on how lapses look on policies that had been sold prior to the pandemic versus policies that had been sold during the pandemic?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nRyan, this is a great question. We noticed higher lapses in 2023, particularly towards the end of it. Because across multiple durations, it leads us to believe that this is really mainly due to the economic pressure and the stress from higher cost of living currently on middle-income family. Nevertheless, we see that the policies written in the last year really had persistency very much in line with historical trends, historical trend by which I mean pre-pandemic, by and large. So we expect that over time, persistency is going to return to normal and pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRyan Joel Krueger\n\nUnderstood. I guess somewhat related to this, it also seems like the redemption rate in ISP has been increasing in recent quarters. Are you seeing -- is that -- do you believe that's a similar dynamic? And I guess if so, do you think you'll continue to see somewhat higher redemptions in 2024 there?\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nYes, Ryan, I'll take that one, because we have monitored those redemption rates as we come through the pandemic. And you're right, they varied from a fairly stable historical trend over the years. Sometimes during the pandemic, people hold their money a little closer, redemption rates went down and then when money has gotten tight, redemption rates have gone up. However, if we try to sort through the pandemic and get all of that unusual noise out of it, what we're seeing right now are redemption rates that are pretty similar to pre-pandemic rates. They might be just a little bit higher, but certainly within our normal range of fluctuations prior to the pandemic. \r\nSo you're right, there are probably people that are drawing down on their accounts a little bit more because of the cost of living, but it's still within the range that we would call normal to pre-pandemic levels. It hasn't exceeded that range yet.\n\nRyan Joel Krueger\n\nOkay. Great. And then since it's your last call, I just wanted to take best wishes and retirement to Alison.\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nSure, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Wilma Burdis with Raymond James.\n\nWilma Carter Jackson Burdis\n\nIs there a way to quantify the Senior Health loss you expect in the next couple of quarters? I know you mentioned it should improve year-over-year, but if there's any way you could provide a little bit more of a fine point on it?\n\nTracy Tan\n\nYes. On Senior Health, because of the renewal season and we still have a lot of cash flow coming through, it will take some time to really analyze and for us to have an accurate read on it. So we really would be able to provide more information next quarter.\n\nWilma Carter Jackson Burdis\n\nOkay. And then with the convention coming up, how should we think about the trajectory of sales and recruiting throughout the year? I know that's usually a boost, but I know that there's a kind of interesting way it can flow through the quarter. So if you can give us an update there?\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nCertainly, that's a great question and get that on every convention is how does the event that takes place almost right in the middle of the year impact the entire year. And as I said in my remarks, we work hard to try to get benefit from the event for the entire year. And right now, we're working and seeing results from people striving to accomplish great things by the event and be recognized for it there. And then, of course, post event, we want to use the momentum that's created by the event and stretch it as long as we can. \r\nSo that's the theory is to try to level it out throughout the year. The reality is there's so much excitement that's created. And generally, we have some incentives that we launch at the convention that do create a spike in activity around the event itself as hard as we work to try to make it -- to level it out over the full year. \r\nSo I would expect right now that you would see kind of reasonable growth running up to the event and in the months, maybe September, October and beyond after the event, in the month of the event in July and in August as we have some short-term incentives and the excitement immediately coming out of event, you'll probably see a spike in recruiting. And then, of course, the pull-through of that, of the licensing and impact on the sales force is much long after that, because it is a fairly long process in some states and provinces to get recruits licensed. \r\nSo I would say that we would expect an impact throughout the year, but you will see the recruiting activity around the event. And then you would see licensing. And theoretically, at least, of course, if productivity stays the same, you would see some sales impact in the last half of the year and working into 2025. Was that helpful?\n\nWilma Carter Jackson Burdis\n\nYes. It sounds great.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Ian Ryave with Jefferies.\n\nIan James Ryave\n\nJust firstly, on Senior Health, can you discuss the reason for the methodology change to marketing development revenues that's resulted in higher LTVs? \r\nAnd then second, can you talk about how you're thinking about increasing penetration of the underserved middle income market where you see the most opportunity? Are there regions, states or cities you're targeting for higher growth?\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nSure. I'll take a shot at both of those and see if it's helpful. We had a change in our contracts with our product providers that provided a little more clarity and perhaps even slightly more certainty in those marketing dollars, because they now -- the relationship we have around them is in riding now. It's not that it can't be changed. It can be changed, but at least I think it's a little clearer and a little -- slightly more ability to anticipate it. And so with that certainty and awareness, we could pull it into the LTV calculation, so it was primarily money we were already receiving in other lines. But with the certainty we moved it into the LTV, and I think that's a pretty standard procedure. And of course, there are additional increases as there have been some commission increases. \r\nSo the change is not solely attributed to that of the increase, perhaps a little over 80% was attributed to the reclass and a little less than 20% to other increases. So that's behind that. Just -- and we like it better, because it provides more clarity to the financials of the business doing it this way. So we took it as a positive process change. But clearly, it's not all financial impact, change is not that big since it's just moving from one area to the other. \r\nAnd then secondly, Ian, on the question of where we target it's interesting, our business grows where we have leadership on the ground, and we do move leadership around occasionally, but not that frequently. And so our business generally runs in line with population of the U.S. and Canada and as the middle income market grows, which it continues to do, we grow, but we have not found it worthwhile to specifically target areas. If we don't have leadership on the ground than us trying to artificially grow in an area that is underrepresented in our business, we've just not found success in doing that. \r\nNow when people ask us, if they want to move to a place with more opportunity, we can tell them, because we know where we're underrepresented, but we've just not found it profitable to move people who choose not to move to a new location and have them struggle. If they want to move back home, where they came from and that's an underrepresented area, that's great. That works well for all of us, but we don't try to do that artificially from the company level.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities.\n\nMark Douglas Hughes\n\nI did want to clarify. I had framed that question badly about the expenses, the $40 million increase on a base of $570 million or so is a completely different matter. So using the $140 million was mistake on my part. And on that basis, it looks pretty reasonable. \r\nOne question on the Senior Health. You said that 25% of the lead there coming from the Primerica sales force. Is that kind of full strength? Is that what you would expect over time, about 25%? Or should that continue to move up as you maybe do other internal initiatives?\n\nGlenn Jackson Williams\n\nYes. There's still room for growth in the numbers, Mark, but the percentage is artificially higher right now, because of the low sales levels in the main part of the e-TeleQuote business. I would anticipate that as we grow together as we grow that business, assuming that we -- to determine that it can be grown in a profitable and sustainable way that we could grow the Primerica business or the Primerica portion of those leads that are referred in by our sales force at a similar rate. And our objective is to run in the maybe 20% range, a little either side of 20%, so it's a little artificially high percentage wise, because e-TeleQuote leads were down in the quarter. \r\nBut we do expect, again, assuming that we can demonstrate the profitability of the business and gain comfort in it that we would grow that. There is more potential on the Primerica side, but we are not expecting that to become 40%, 50% of the total. That's not the model we're running to. It's as we've described it, the Primerica piece is a unique advantage that we can have in this marketplace because we do have access to those leads in a unique way through the relationships of our Primerica representatives and those leads are extraordinarily high quality, as we've all talked about before. \r\nSo we want a lot of them. But at the same time, we want that business to be successful on its own. So something in the range of 20%, a little higher than that a little lower as we grow would be a target, I would say.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude today's conference.

Stock Repurchase: Completed a $375 million share repurchase in 2023 and authorized a new $425 million program for 2024.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with GNRC.\n\nOn February 13, 2024, Primerica Inc (NYSE:PRI) released its 8-K filing, announcing financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. The company, a leading provider of financial services to middle-income households in the United States and Canada, reported a 6% increase in total revenues to $726.3 million and a 4% increase in net income to $151.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted EPS increased by 9% to $4.30, and the life-licensed sales force expanded to a record 141,572, a 5% increase year-over-year.\n\nPrimerica's robust performance in the fourth quarter is significant as it demonstrates the company's ability to grow its core business segments despite market challenges. The increase in term life policies issued and the growth in investment product sales are particularly important for an insurance company, as these metrics indicate both the company's competitive strength in the market and its ability to generate revenue through its product offerings. Primerica Inc (PRI) Reports Growth in Q4 Earnings and Sales Force Expansion\n\nFinancial Highlights and Segment Performance\n\nThe company's term life insurance segment saw a 4% increase in revenues to $431.3 million and a 6% increase in pre-tax operating income to $140.3 million. The investment and savings products segment also performed well, with a 12% increase in revenues to $221.7 million and an 11% increase in pre-tax operating income to $62.8 million. However, the senior health segment experienced a decline, reflecting lower sales and a pre-tax operating loss of $2.7 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrimerica's capital position remains strong, with a statutory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio for Primerica Life Insurance Company estimated at approximately 435% as of December 31, 2023. The company also completed a $375 million share repurchase in 2023 and has authorized a new $425 million share repurchase program through December 31, 2024.\n\nChallenges and Outlook\n\nDespite the positive results, Primerica faced challenges in the senior health segment, resulting in a small loss. Additionally, the company noted pressure from higher living costs contributing to elevated lapse rates in life insurance policies. However, CEO Glenn Williams expressed optimism for 2024, citing the expanding sales force and upcoming biennial convention as opportunities for growth.\n\nFor the full year, Primerica recruited nearly 362,000 individuals, leading to a 9% increase in new insurance licenses and an 8% increase in issued term life insurance policies. While investment product sales declined by 8% year-over-year due to volatile equity markets, the overall financial results for the year showed a 23% increase in net income to $576.6 million and a 29% increase in diluted EPS to $15.94.\n\nPrimerica's earnings report underscores the company's resilience and ability to navigate a complex financial landscape. The growth in key metrics, such as the life-licensed sales force and investment product sales, coupled with strategic stock repurchases, positions the company well for continued success in serving middle-income families' financial needs.\n\nFor more detailed information on Primerica's financial performance, including the full earnings release and financial statements, please refer to the company's 8-K filing.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Primerica Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

(NYSE: PRI) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Total revenues of $726.3 million increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income of $151.9 million increased 4%, while earnings per diluted share of $4.30 increased 9% compared to the prior year period.\n\nAdjusted operating revenues of $724.3 million increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted net operating income of $150.4 million increased 4%, while adjusted operating earnings per diluted share of $4.25 increased 9% compared to the prior year period.\n\nStrong recruiting and licensing trends continue to reflect the attractiveness of Primerica\u2019s business model and fuel the growth of its powerful distribution platform that now exceeds 141,500 life-licensed individuals. The Company\u2019s financial results during the fourth quarter reflected the benefit of a large and stable block of in-force term life insurance policies, higher investment products sales and appreciation of client asset values, while net investment income was higher due to an increase in interest rates and growth in the size of the investment portfolio. The Company continued to experience pressures in senior health, resulting in a small loss in the segment.\n\n\"Strong fourth quarter results completed another solid year at Primerica as we continue to meet the growing financial needs of middle-income families,\" said Glenn Williams, Chief Executive Officer of Primerica, Inc. \"Our expanding sales force plays a crucial role in our success, and I believe 2024 holds exciting opportunities to build momentum as we work toward our biennial convention in July.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recruited nearly 362,000 individuals, resulting in 9% increase in new insurance licenses and 5% growth in the size of the life-licensed sales force. The momentum of the sales force led to an 8% increase in issued term life insurance policies and a 15% increase in new issued term life face amount. Investment product sales were solid at $9.2 billion, declining 8% year-over-year due to pressures from volatile equity markets in the first half of 2023. Comparing financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022, net income of $576.6 million increased 23%, while earnings per diluted share of $15.94 increased 29%. Excluding certain non-GAAP adjustments, such as the impact of a $60 million goodwill impairment in the prior year, adjusted net operating income of $581.4 million increased 8%, while adjusted operating earnings per diluted share of $16.07 increased 15%.\n\nFourth Quarter Distribution & Segment Results\n\nDistribution Results Q4 2023 Q4 2022 %\r\nChange Adjusted\r\nQ4 2022 %\r\nChange Life-Licensed Sales Force 141,572 135,208 5 % Recruits 89,992 77,025 17 % New Life-Licensed Representatives 13,029 11,117 17 % Life Insurance Policies Issued (1) 88,757 72,544 22 % 79,282 12 % Life Productivity (1) (2) 0.21 0.18 * 0.20 * Issued Term Life Face Amount ($ billions) (3) $ 29.3 $ 25.3 16 % ISP Product Sales ($ billions) $ 2.4 $ 2.1 13 % Average Client Asset Values ($ billions) $ 91.0 $ 83.3 9 % Senior Health Submitted Policies (4) 18,663 23,060 (19 )% Senior Health Approved Policies (5) 17,181 20,705 (17 )% Closed U.S. Mortgage Volume ($ million brokered) $ 72.9 $ 78.9 (8 )%\n\n____________________ (1) Previously reported numbers for the three months ended December 31, 2022 have been adjusted as a result of a product change made in the fourth quarter of 2022, which modified how policies are structured in relation to individual lives.

In total, the Company recruited 89,992 individuals and added 13,029 new life-licenses to end the year with a record 141,572 independent life-licensed representatives, up 5% year-over-year.\n\nTerm Life Insurance\n\nSales volume remained robust with 88,757 new term life insurance policies issued during the fourth quarter, a 12% increase compared to the adjusted number of policies issued in the prior year period. Issued term life face amount, which captures the face amount of both new policies issued and additions to in-force policies, increased 16% to $29.3 billion compared to $25.3 billion in the prior year period. Productivity, as measured by the number of policies issued per life-licensed reps per month, increased from an adjusted 0.20 policies in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.21 policies in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFourth quarter revenues of $431.3 million increased 4% compared to the prior year period, while pre-tax operating income of $140.3 million increased 6%, in line with the growth in adjusted direct premiums. The Company believes pressure from higher costs of living has likely contributed to the elevated lapse rates it continues to experience, although there was minimal impact on the fourth quarter\u2019s financial results. The benefits and claims ratio was 58.2% and the DAC amortization and insurance commissions ratio was 12.0%, both largely consistent with the prior year period. Year-over-year, insurance expenses declined $1.6 million due to higher expenses in the prior year period associated with the launch of the new term life insurance products.\n\nInvestment and Savings Products\n\nTotal product sales of $2.4 billion during the fourth quarter increased 13% compared to the prior year period driven by a combination of stronger demand for variable annuities and U.S. mutual funds. The Company also experienced increased momentum in managed accounts sales following a temporary disruption caused by a platform conversion during the third quarter. Client asset values ended the year at $96.7 billion, up 15% year-over-year.\n\nFourth quarter revenues of $221.7 million increased 12% compared to the prior year period, while pre-tax operating income of $62.8 million increased 11% driven by higher up-front revenue-generating product sales and an increase in average client asset values. Sales-based revenues and sales-based commission expenses increased 15% and 13%, respectively, benefiting from higher sales of variable annuities. Asset-based revenues increased 12%, outpacing 9% growth in average client asset values. This was due to a continued mix shift toward U.S. managed accounts and products such as the Canadian principal distributor mutual funds for which the Company earns higher asset-based fees in lieu of up-front sales-based compensation. The change in asset-based commission expenses was consistent with the growth in asset-based revenues, when including asset-based commission expenses on Canadian segregated funds which are recognized as insurance commissions and amortization of DAC. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased $3.9 million due to timing of costs associated with the managed account platform conversion.\n\nSenior Health\n\nThe fourth quarter results reflect lower sales from a less tenured agent mix. Approximately 17,000 policies were approved by health carriers, which represents 17% fewer policies than the prior year period. The lifetime value of commissions per approved policy (\"LTV\") was $1,109 which, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, includes marketing development funds that are now contractually earned on a per policy basis. The contract acquisition costs per approved policy (\"CAC\") were $878.\n\nFourth quarter revenues of $20.1 million declined $7.7 million, or 28% compared to the prior year period, largely driven by lower sales volume in the current period. The pre-tax operating loss of $2.7 million reflected higher CAC due to lower productivity from newer agents. The Company did not contribute cash to the segment in 2023.\n\nCorporate and Other Distributed Products\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the segment recorded an adjusted operating pre-tax loss of $5.4 million compared to an adjusted operating pre-tax loss of $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement was driven by a $7.5 million increase in adjusted net investment income, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in benefits and claims for an adjustment made to the ceded reserves estimate for a closed block of non-term life insurance business.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe effective tax rate was 22.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 21.4% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate in the prior year period was lower than the current year period because it included a tax benefit from revaluing the Canadian deferred tax asset to reflect an incremental Canadian federal tax enacted in December of 2022.\n\nCapital\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased $72.5 million of its common stock, completing the Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase $375 million of common stock during 2023. On November 16, 2023, the Board authorized a new $425 million share repurchase program to occur through December 31, 2024.\n\nPrimerica has a strong balance sheet, including invested assets and cash at the holding company of $382 million. Primerica Life Insurance Company\u2019s statutory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio was estimated to be approximately 435% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company presents certain non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, the Company presents adjusted direct premiums, other ceded premiums, adjusted operating revenues, adjusted operating income before income taxes, adjusted net operating income, adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share.\n\nAdjusted direct premiums and other ceded premiums are net of amounts ceded under coinsurance transactions that were executed concurrent with our initial public offering (the \"IPO coinsurance transactions\") for all periods presented. We exclude amounts ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions in measuring adjusted direct premiums and other ceded premiums to present meaningful comparisons of the actual premiums economically maintained by the Company. Amounts ceded under the IPO coinsurance transactions will continue to decline over time as policies terminate within this block of business.\n\nAdjusted operating revenues, adjusted operating income before income taxes, adjusted net operating income and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share exclude the impact of investment gains (losses) and fair value mark-to-market (\"MTM\") investment adjustments, including credit impairments, for all periods presented. We exclude investment gains (losses), including credit impairments, and MTM investment adjustments in measuring these non-GAAP financial measures to eliminate period-over-period fluctuations that may obscure comparisons of operating results due to items such as the timing of recognizing gains (losses) and market pricing variations prior to an invested asset\u2019s maturity or sale that are not directly associated with the Company\u2019s insurance operations. Adjusted operating income before taxes, adjusted net operating income, and diluted adjusted operating earnings per share also exclude transaction-related expenses/recoveries associated with the purchase of e-TeleQuote Insurance, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, \"e-TeleQuote\"), adjustments to share-based compensation expense for shares exchanged in the business combination, and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. We exclude e-TeleQuote transaction-related expenses/recoveries and non-cash goodwill impairment charges as these are non-recurring items that will cause incomparability between period-over-period results. We exclude adjustments to share-based compensation expense for shares exchanged in the business combination to eliminate period-over-period fluctuations that may obscure comparisons of operating results primarily due to the volatility of changes in the fair value of shares which were acquired for no additional consideration. Adjusted operating income before income taxes and adjusted net operating income exclude income attributable to the noncontrolling interest to present only the income that is attributable to stockholders of the Company.\n\nAdjusted stockholders\u2019 equity excludes the impact of net unrealized investment gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented. We exclude unrealized investment gains (losses) in measuring adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity as unrealized gains (losses) from the Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities are largely caused by market movements in interest rates and credit spreads that do not necessarily correlate with the cash flows we will ultimately realize when an available-for-sale security matures or is sold. Adjusted stockholders\u2019 equity also excludes the difference in future policy benefits calculated using the current discount rate and future policy benefits calculated using the locked-in discount rate at contract issuance recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. We exclude the impact from the difference in the discount rate in measuring adjusted stockholders' equity as such difference is caused by market movements in interest rates that are not permanent and may not align with the cash flows we will ultimately incur when policy benefits are settled.\n\nOur definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of similar measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance. Furthermore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of the core ongoing business. These measures have limitations and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are attached to this release.\n\nEarnings Webcast Information\n\nPrimerica will hold a webcast on Wednesday, February 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern, to discuss the quarter\u2019s results.

        "title": "Here's Why Primerica (PRI) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy",
        "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Primerica (PRI), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Primerica currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PRI that show why this life insurance and financial products company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor PRI, shares are up 3.61% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry is up 0.24% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.06% compares favorably with the industry's 0.48% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Primerica have increased 14.77% over the past quarter, and have gained 40.35% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 14.15% and 24.47%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to PRI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PRI is currently averaging 118,903 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PRI.\n\nOver the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PRI's consensus estimate, increasing from $16.00 to $16.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PRI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Primerica on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
