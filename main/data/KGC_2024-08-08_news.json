        "title": "Why Is Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) a Good Dividend-Paying Stock to Buy Under $15?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks Under $15. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) stands against the other dividend-paying stocks under $15.\n\nDuring the bull market driven by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, dividend stocks lagged in performance. Since the beginning of 2024, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has increased by only 5.50%, while the Nasdaq has risen by 13.6%. That said, the performance of tech stocks becomes less significant when considering the long-term returns of dividend stocks. Dividend-paying stocks with strong balance sheets and stable yields can offer investors consistent income, protection against market declines, and steady growth for their investments.\n\nWhen investing in dividend stocks, it might seem logical to invest in stocks with the highest yields. However, according to analysts, concentrating solely on yield may not be the most effective investment approach. Not all dividend yields are equally secure, as companies under financial strain may suspend or cut their dividend payments. Therefore, investors are encouraged to prioritize the sustainability of dividends and, if possible, seek out companies with a track record of dividend growth. To know more about strong dividend payers, have a look at Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.\n\nHistorically, companies that consistently grow their dividends have outperformed those that do not pay dividends, while also exhibiting less volatility. Although dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate, just like in today\u2019s time, they have played a major role in equity total returns over the decades. From 1930 to 2023, dividends and their reinvestment accounted for 40% of the annualized total return of the broader market, with the remaining return coming from capital appreciation.\n\nCompanies globally are distributing record dividends to shareholders, largely due to their robust balance sheets. With companies holding near-record levels of cash and liquid assets, they are increasingly returning this cash to investors through dividends. Global dividends grew from $1.23 trillion in 2020 to $1.66 trillion in 2023, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The firm forecasts total dividends to reach $1.72 trillion for 2024, up 3.9% on a headline basis.\n\nA company's dividend payout ratio is an important measure of how flexible its dividend policy is. Firms that only earn enough to cover their dividends or pay out most of their earnings as dividends might face risks from competitive pressures, as their cash flow may not be adequate to sustain operations. Moreover, companies with high dividend yields or, more critically, high payout ratios might be at risk of limited future growth, which could impact both share price appreciation and the potential for increasing dividends. According to data collected by Nuveen, stocks with the highest payout ratios have not been the strongest long-term performers. Over the past 20 years, companies with medium and medium-high payout ratios that paid dividends have generally delivered better performance.\n\nConsistently growing dividends is a challenging target, as it requires companies to be financially very stable. For companies that are still in the growth phase and have lower share prices, evaluating dividend sustainability becomes a straightforward metric to consider. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks under $15.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener to find dividend stocks trading below $15 as of the close of July 31. From the initial list, we narrowed down the selection to companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and possess strong dividend policies, ensuring consistent future dividends. From the resultant list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database of 920 hedge funds and their holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company reported strong earnings in the second quarter of 2024. Its gold equivalent production reached 535,338 ounces, up from 527,399 ounces in the previous quarter. This growth was fueled by increased throughput and improved grades at various mining sites, reflecting efficient operations and strong production capabilities.\n\nAs a dividend stock, Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) is favored by investors because of its robust cash generation. In Q2 2024, the company generated $604 million in operating cash flow and its attributable free cash flow came in at $346 million.

The company remains committed to carefully managing its operations, with an emphasis on maintaining cost efficiency and capital discipline while progressing with projects and exploration targets to enhance future value. Additionally, it continues to reinforce its investment-grade balance sheet and reduce debt.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) reached its all-time low in November 2000, trading at approximately $1.31 per share. This decline was caused by volatile gold prices, operational difficulties, and significant debt levels. Since then, the stock has surged by nearly 568%, with exceptional performance during the Great Recession of 2008. It also hit one of its peaks in April 2008, reaching $22.70 per share.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) started paying dividends in 2020 and has paid regular dividends to shareholders since then.

You can visit 10 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks Under $15to see the other dividend-paying stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of KGC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Are Investors Undervaluing Kinross Gold (KGC) Right Now?",
        "content": "Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\n\nLooking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.\n\nOn top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the \"Value\" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and \"A\" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) is a stock many investors are watching right now. KGC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 13.58 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 14.97. Over the last 12 months, KGC's Forward P/E has been as high as 19 and as low as 10.88, with a median of 14.04.\n\nInvestors should also note that KGC holds a PEG ratio of 0.46. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. KGC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.50. KGC's PEG has been as high as 2.13 and as low as 0.41, with a median of 0.92, all within the past year.\n\nValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. KGC has a P/S ratio of 2.28. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.03.\n\nFinally, our model also underscores that KGC has a P/CF ratio of 6.81. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 12.43. Within the past 12 months, KGC's P/CF has been as high as 7.25 and as low as 4.18, with a median of 5.45.\n\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Kinross Gold is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, KGC feels like a great value stock at the moment.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nWhile you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nFor growth investors, a company's financial strength, overall health, and future outlook take precedence, so they'll want to zero in on the Growth Style Score.

        "title": "Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Kinross Gold (KGC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $9.45 in the previous session. Kinross Gold has gained 44.6% since the start of the year compared to the -5.9% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 19.3% return for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 31, 2024, Kinross Gold reported EPS of $0.14 versus consensus estimate of $0.13.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Kinross Gold is expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share on $4.71 billion in revenues. This represents a 29.55% change in EPS on a 11.07% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.70 per share on $4.38 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 22.59% and -6.92%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nKinross Gold may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nKinross Gold has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 15.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 7X versus its peer group's average of 9.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.52. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Kinross Gold currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Kinross Gold fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Kinross Gold shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nHow Does KGC Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of KGC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is B2Gold Corp (BTG). BTG has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. B2Gold Corp beat our consensus estimate by 20%, and for the current fiscal year, BTG is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share on revenue of $1.95 billion.\n\nShares of B2Gold Corp have gained 1.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 9.59X and a P/CF of 4.95X.\n\nThe Mining - Gold industry is in the top 22% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for KGC and BTG, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "White Gold Corp. Encounters Highest Gold Values to Date and Doubles Strike Length of the Newly Discovered Gold-In-Soil Anomaly to 2.2 km on the QV Property and Prepares for Maiden Diamond Drill Program",
        "content": "White Gold Corp.\n\nFigure 1 Figure 1\n\nFigure 2 Figure 2\n\nTORONTO, Aug. 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W) (the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that infill and extension soil sampling has refined and extended the newly discovered gold-in-soil anomaly on its QV property to 2.2 km along strike (Figure 1). The soil anomaly is located approximately 9 km northwest of the VG deposit and appears to be similar in character to the VG and Golden Saddle deposits which form part of the Company\u2019s flagship White Gold Project. The White Gold Project is located in west-central Yukon, Canada, and comprises 16 million tonnes averaging 2.23 g/t Au for 1,152,900 ounces of gold in the Indicated Resource category and 19 million tonnes averaging 1.54 g/t Au for 942,400 ounces of gold in the Inferred Resource category (1). These new results form part of the Company\u2019s 2024 exploration program on its extensive and underexplored land package in the emerging White Gold District, Yukon, supported by strategic partners including Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC).\n\n\u201cWe are quite encouraged by these latest results from this newly discovered target. Our early-season soil sampling program has considerably extended the strike length of the target by over 1 km to 2.2 km and provided even greater continuity of high gold values. Furthermore, the size, tenor, geochemical and geomagnetic characteristics of this target are also similar to our flagship Golden Saddle and VG deposits and represents exciting expansion potential with a maiden diamond drill program set to commence in the coming weeks\u201d stated David D\u2019Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nShawn Ryan, Co-Founder and Chief Technical Advisor stated, \u201cThis newly discovered soil anomaly on the QV property is an interesting grass roots discovery for the Company as it reminds me of the anomaly that led to the discovery of the Golden Saddle and QV deposits which are close by and share a lot of similarities. Soil sampling followed by our systematic evaluation has proven very effective in our district and we are looking forward to drilling this new target.\u201d\n\nMaps and images accompanying this news release can be found at http://whitegoldcorp.ca/investors/exploration-highlights/.\n\nHighlights\n\n2024 soil survey consisted of 787 samples (Figure 2). The surface expression of the gold-in-soil anomaly strikes east-northeast, measures 350 m wide x 2.2 km long, and is open along strike to the west and east. Gold values range from < 0.5 ppb Au to a maximum of 600 ppb Au, with 29 samples returning greater than 80 ppb Au (approximately 99th percentile) in the range of 82.3 to 600 ppb Au. The gold anomaly is associated with anomalous tellurium and low arsenic in soils, which represents a geochemical signature similar to the VG and Golden Saddle deposits which both form part of the Company\u2019s flagship White Gold Project. Magnetic and LiDAR data reveals that the newly identified soil anomaly is hosted within a similar structural environment as the VG and Golden Saddle deposits. 2D inversions of recently completed VLF-EM survey lines indicate the gold-in-soil anomaly is associated with a moderately north-dipping hanging wall \u2013 footwall contact zone. A maiden diamond drill program is currently being planned and expected to commence in the coming days.\n\n2024 Soil Sampling Program\n\nThe 2024 soil survey consisted of 787 samples which included both infill and extension samples. The purpose of this year\u2019s sampling was to provide better resolution over the main portion of the anomaly which was identified in 2023, and to extend the anomaly along strike to the west and east. Infill soil samples are spaced at 25 m on 50 spaced survey lines, and extension samples are spaced at 50 m on 100 spaced survey lines. The company has collected approximately 1,000 soil samples over the past two field seasons in defining this new target. Gold values range from < 0.5 ppb Au to a maximum of 600 ppb Au, with 29 samples returning greater than 80 ppb Au (approximately 99th percentile) in the range of 82.3 to 600 ppb Au. The anomaly also has associated anomalous tellurium. Arsenic in soil values is low, and overall, the signature appears to be similar to the VG and Golden Saddle deposits suggesting a similar style of mineralization. The surface expression of the gold-in-soil anomaly strikes east-northeast, measures 350 m wide x 2.2 km long, and is open along strike to the west and east towards the previously known Korat Diego anomaly.\n\nMagnetic data reveals that the newly identified soil anomaly is situated near a mafic belt with a NNW-SSE orientation, similar to the structural context of the VG, Golden Saddle, and Ryan\u2019s Surprise deposits located along strike approximately 9 to 19 km to the SE and SSE. The highly magnetic mafic belts are observed to occupy the hanging wall of E- to ENE-dipping, district-scale thrust faults, with gold mineralization at the VG, Golden Saddle, and Ryan's Surprise deposits occurring where intersected by significant NE- or NW-trending faults. At the newly identified soil anomaly, anomalous gold is localized at a fault intersection of a similar structural and magnetic pattern to those of the mentioned deposits and is associated with a semi-circular magnetic high approximately 1 km in diameter.\n\n2D inversions of recently completed VLF-EM survey lines over the target indicate the gold-in-soil anomaly is associated with a moderately north-dipping hanging wall \u2013 footwall contact zone.\n\nThe Company is currently planning a maiden diamond drill program on the target which will consist of a minimum of 1200 m of drilling that will test up to 800 m of strike length.\n\nAbout the QV Property\n\nThe QV property comprises 1003 quartz claims which over an area of 19,671 hectares and hosts the VG deposit, which hosts an open pittable Inferred resource of 287,100 oz gold at 1.53 g/t(1) and forms part of the Company\u2019s flagship White Gold Project. The mineralization is hosted along a N-E trending, gently south dipping structural zone that has been traced for over 700 m at surface and consists of disseminated to vein-controlled pyrite with brecciation, stockwork quartz-carbonate veining, and sericite alteration. The VG shares strong similarities to the Golden Saddle deposit located 11 km south of the VG deposit on the White Gold property both in structural setting as well as mineralization style and is open along strike and at depth. The property also hosts several other prospective targets which have received limited exploration work and offer potential for additional discoveries.\n\nSoil Sampling Methods and Analysis\n\nThe 2024 QV property soil geochemistry survey was contracted to GroundTruth Exploration Inc. of Dawson City, Yukon. Field technicians navigated to pre-planned sample sites using handheld GPS units and collected C-Horizon soil samples using an Eijklcamp brand hand auger at a depth of between 20 cm and 110 cm. Typically, 400 to 500 g of soil is placed in a pre-labeled bag, and a field duplicate sample is taken once every 25 samples. The GPS location of the sample site is recorded with the GPS unit, and the waypoint location is labeled with the project name and the sample identification number. A weather-proof handheld device equipped with a barcode scanner is used in the field to record the descriptive attributes of the sample collected, including sample identification number, soil colour, soil horizon, slope, sample depth, ground and tree vegetation, sample quality, and any other relevant information.\n\nAnalytical work for the 2024 soil geochemistry surveys was carried out at Bureau Veritas (BV) Canada, with preparation completed at their Whitehorse, YT facility and analysis at their hub laboratory located in Vancouver, BC. All soil samples were assayed for gold and a 37 multi-element suite using 0.25g aqua-regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis (Code AQ201). BV is an ISO 9001:2008 accredited facility, certificate number FM63007.\n\nAbout White Gold Corp.\r\nThe Company owns a portfolio of 15,876 quartz claims across 26 properties covering approximately 315,000 hectares (3,150 km2) representing approximately 40% of the Yukon\u2019s emerging White Gold District. The Company\u2019s flagship White Gold project hosts four near-surface gold deposits which collectively contain an estimated 1,152,900 ounces of gold in Indicated Resources and 942,400 ounces of gold in Inferred Resources(1). Regional exploration work has also produced several other new discoveries and prospective targets on the Company\u2019s claim packages which border sizable gold discoveries including the Coffee project owned by Newmont Corporation with Measured and Indicated Resources of 2.1 Moz at 1.28 g/t gold and Inferred Resources of 0.2 Moz at 1.04 g/t gold(2), and Western Copper and Gold Corporation\u2019s Casino project which has Measured and Indicated Resources of 7.6 Blb copper and 14.5 Moz gold and Inferred Resources of 3.3 Blb copper and 6.6 Moz gold(3).

        "title": "Kinross Gold (KGC) Q2 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates",
        "content": "Kinross Gold (KGC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this gold mining company would post earnings of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.10, delivering a surprise of 66.67%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nKinross Gold , which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, posted revenues of $1.22 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.09 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nKinross Gold shares have added about 44.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14%.\n\nWhat's Next for Kinross Gold?\n\nWhile Kinross Gold has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kinross Gold: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.12 on $1.12 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.57 on $4.69 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Mining - Gold is currently in the top 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Barrick Gold (GOLD), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 12.\n\nThis gold and copper mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +36.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nBarrick Gold's revenues are expected to be $3.02 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Production of 535,338 gold equivalent ounces (Au eq. oz.). Production cost of sales of $1,029 per Au eq. oz. sold and all-in sustaining cost1 of $1,387 per Au eq. oz. sold. Margins2 increased to $1,313 per Au eq. oz. sold, outpacing the rise in the average realized gold price. Operating cash flow of $604.0 million and adjusted operating cash flow1 of $478.1 million. Attributablefree cash flow1 of $345.9 million. Reported net earnings of $210.9 million, or $0.17 per share, with adjusted net earnings1 of $174.7 million, or $0.14 per share1. Balance sheet strength: Kinross has improved its debt metrics, with term loan repayments of $200.0 million. Total liquidity3 is approximately $2.1 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $480.0 million. Kinross\u2019 Board of Directors declared a quarterly\u00a0dividend of $0.03 per common share payable on September 6, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 22, 2024. Climate Report: Kinross released its 2023 Climate Report, providing a comprehensive summary of its progress in 2023.\n\nOperations:\n\nTasiast, Paracatu and La Coipa delivered 67% of total production, with production cost of sales of $848 per Au eq. oz. sold and margins2 of $1,494 per Au eq. oz. sold. Sustained strong performance at Tasiast as the mine continued to be the highest-margin operation in the portfolio, generating significant free cash flow. Fort Knox delivered a solid quarter, increasing production substantially at lower costs compared with Q1 2024.\n\nDevelopment Projects and Exploration:\n\nAt Great Bear, Kinross remains on track to release a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) in September. During the quarter, Kinross drilled the deepest drill hole to date, which returned 3.8m at 9.52 g/t at a vertical depth of 1,575m, demonstrating robust mineralization at depth, well outside the current resource. Manh Choh achieved a significant milestone, on schedule, and poured its first gold bar on July 8, 2024. Full commissioning of the modifications at the Fort Knox mill is expected in the third quarter and the project remains on track to deliver its planned production this year. At Round MountainPhase X, the exploration decline is progressing well with over 2,200 metres developed to date. Extension drilling has intersected mineralization with strong grades and widths outside of the primary exploration target.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO commentary:\r\nJ. Paul Rollinson, CEO, made the following comments in relation to 2024 second-quarter results:\n\n\u201cKinross had another strong quarter supporting an excellent first half of the year. Our portfolio of mines performed well, delivering high-margin production, and we remain on track to meet our annual production and cost guidance for 2024.\n\n\u201cQuarter-over-quarter, our margins2 grew by 21% to $1,313 per gold ounce sold, outpacing the rise in gold price, and attributable free cash flow1 more than doubled to $346 million, totalling $491 million year-to-date. We are continuing to prudently manage our business with a focus on maintaining our cost profile and capital discipline while continuing to advance projects and exploration targets to drive future value. We also continue to strengthen our investment grade balance sheet and reduce debt.\n\n\u201cThanks to the hard work of our team and partners in Alaska, we achieved an important milestone, on schedule, and poured the first gold bar\u00a0from Manh Choh in early July. The mine remains on plan, the Fort Knox mill is performing well, and the project is expected to be fully commissioned in Q3.\n\n\u201cAt Great Bear, the drilling campaign continued to demonstrate positive results, including intersecting high-grade mineralization in the deepest drill hole to date, outside the current resource. Permitting and engineering for both the AEX and Main Project are continuing to advance, and we are looking forward to releasing a Preliminary Economic Assessment in September.\n\n\u201cWe are also pleased to have released our 2023 Climate Report. We are on track to achieve our target of a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity by 2030.\u201d\n\nSummary of financial and operating results\n\nThree months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, (unaudited, in millions of U.S. dollars, except ounces, per share amounts, and per ounce amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating Highlights  Total gold equivalent ounces(a) Produced 535,338 555,036 1,062,737 1,021,058 Sold 520,760 552,969 1,043,160 1,043,299 Financial Highlights Metal sales $ 1,219.5 $ 1,092.3 $ 2,301.0 $ 2,021.6 Production cost of sales $ 536.1 $ 497.9 $ 1,049.0 $ 981.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 295.8 $ 239.3 $ 566.5 $ 451.2 Operating earnings $ 298.3 $ 237.8 $ 491.5 $ 381.7 Net earnings attributable to common shareholders $ 210.9 $ 151.0 $ 317.9 $ 241.2 Basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders $ 0.17 $ 0.12 $ 0.26 $ 0.20 Diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders $ 0.17 $ 0.12 $ 0.26 $ 0.20 Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders(b) $ 174.7 $ 167.6 $ 299.6 $ 255.2 Adjusted net earnings per share(b) $ 0.14 $ 0.14 $ 0.24 $ 0.21 Net cash flow provided from operating activities $ 604.0 $ 528.6 $ 978.4 $ 787.6 Adjusted operating cash flow(b) $ 478.1 $ 459.1 $ 903.0 $ 791.9 Capital expenditures(c) $ 274.2 $ 281.9 $ 516.1 $ 503.1 Attributable(d) capital expenditures(b) $ 264.5 $ 272.3 $ 496.6 $ 484.9 Attributable(d) free cash flow(b) $ 345.9 $ 258.3 $ 491.2 $ 305.3 Average realized gold price per ounce(e) $ 2,342 $ 1,976 $ 2,206 $ 1,937 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce(a) sold(f)(g) $ 1,029 $ 900 $ 1,006 $ 941 Production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis(b)(g) $ 989 $ 845 $ 965 $ 885 All-in sustaining cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis(b)(g) $ 1,357 $ 1,262 $ 1,319 $ 1,272 All-in sustaining cost per equivalent ounce(a) sold(b)(g) $ 1,387 $ 1,296 $ 1,348 $ 1,308 Attributable(d) all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis(b) $ 1,756 $ 1,596 $ 1,685 $ 1,606 Attributable(d) all-in cost per equivalent ounce(a) sold(b) $ 1,774 $ 1,614 $ 1,702 $ 1,624 (a)\u201cGold equivalent ounces\u201d include silver ounces produced and sold converted to a gold equivalent based on a ratio of the average spot market prices for the commodities for each period.

As a result, production cost of sales and all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios are equal to attributable production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios, as applicable.\n\nThe following operating and financial results are based on second-quarter gold equivalent production:\n\nProduction: Kinross produced 535,338 Au eq. oz. in Q2 2024, compared with 555,036 Au eq. oz. in Q2 2023. The 4% year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower grades at Paracatu according to the planned mining sequence.\n\nAverage realized gold price4: The average realized gold price in Q2 2024 was $2,342 per ounce, compared with $1,976 per ounce in Q2 2023.\n\nRevenue: During the second quarter, revenue increased to $1,219.5 million, compared with $1,092.3 million during Q2 2023.\n\nProduction cost of sales: Production cost of sales per Au eq. oz. sold increased to $1,029 for the quarter, compared with $900 in Q2 2023.\n\nProduction cost of sales per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis1 was $989 in Q2 2024, compared with $845\u00a0in Q2 2023, based on gold sales of 505,122 ounces and silver sales of 1,267,528 ounces.\n\nMargins2: Kinross\u2019 margin per Au eq. oz. sold increased by 22% to $1,313 for Q2 2024, compared with the Q2 2023 margin of $1,076, outpacing the 19% increase in average realized gold price4.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost1: All-in sustaining cost per Au eq. oz. sold was $1,387 in Q2 2024, compared with $1,296 in Q2 2023.\n\nIn Q2 2024, all-in sustaining cost per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis was $1,357, compared with $1,262 in Q2 2023.\n\nOperating cash flow: Operating cash flow was $604.0 million for Q2 2024, compared with $528.6 million for Q2 2023.\n\nAdjusted operating cash flow1 for Q2 2024 was $478.1 million, compared with $459.1 million for Q2 2023.\n\nAttributable free cash flow1: Attributable free cash flow increased by 34% to $345.9 million in Q2 2024, compared with $258.3 million in Q2 2023.\n\nEarnings: Reported net earnings increased by 40% to $210.9 million for Q2 2024, or $0.17 per share, compared with reported net earnings of $151.0 million, or $0.12 per share, for Q2 2023.\n\nAdjusted net earnings1 increased to $174.7 million, or $0.14 per share1, for Q2 2024, compared with $167.6 million, or $0.14 per share1, for Q2 2023.\n\nAttributable capital expenditures1: Attributable capital expenditures were $264.5 million for Q2 2024, compared with $272.3 million for Q2 2023, primarily due to a decrease in capital development at Bald Mountain and La Coipa, partially offset by capital development at Round Mountain Phase S.\n\nBalance sheet\n\nThe Company maintained its investment grade ratings and strengthened its balance sheet during the second quarter, including repaying $200.0 million on its term loan.\n\nKinross had cash and cash equivalents of $480.0 million as of June 30, 2024, compared with $352.4 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company has additional available credit5 of $1.65 billion and total liquidity3 of approximately $2.1 billion.\n\nDividend\n\nAs part of its quarterly dividend program, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.03 per common share payable on September 6, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 22, 2024.\n\nOperating results\n\nMine-by-mine summaries for 2024 second-quarter operating results may be found on pages 10 and 14 of this news release. Highlights include the following:\n\nTasiast continued its consistent and solid performance, with production increasing compared with Q1 2024 mainly due to higher grades and record mill throughput, while cost of sales per ounce sold remained largely in line. Production increased compared with Q2 2023 mainly as a result of the completion of the Tasiast 24k project in the second half of 2023, and cost of sales per ounce sold was in line.\n\nAt Paracatu, production increased quarter-over-quarter mainly due to higher grades and recoveries, while cost of sales per ounce sold decreased mainly due to the higher production. Production was lower compared with Q2 2023 mainly due to lower grades according to the planned mining sequence, and cost of sales per ounce sold was higher mainly due to the decrease in grade and production.\n\nAt La Coipa, production was lower quarter-over-quarter mainly due to a decrease in grades and recoveries, and cost of sales per ounce sold was higher mainly due to higher mill maintenance costs and timing of sales. Production was largely in line year-over-year, and cost of sales per ounce sold was higher primarily due to a lower proportion of mining activities related to capital development and higher mill maintenance costs.\n\nIn the second quarter, strong grades and recovery offset lower throughput. The operation continued to generate robust cash flow, and full-year production guidance remains on track. The Company is completing mill maintenance work aimed at increasing long-term plant reliability.\n\nAt Fort Knox, production increased significantly compared with the previous quarter mainly due to an increase in mill throughput, grades and recoveries, and was in line year-over-year. Cost of sales per ounce sold decreased compared with the previous quarter mainly due to the increase in production, and cost of sales per ounce sold increased year-over-year due to higher contractor and labour costs.\n\nAt Round Mountain, production decreased quarter-over-quarter mainly due to lower mill throughput and grades, and increased year-over-year mainly due to higher mill grades. Cost of sales per ounce sold was higher quarter-over-quarter mainly due to the decrease in production, and year-over-year as a result of higher cost ounces produced from the heap leach pads, partially offset by lower reagent and contractor costs.\n\nAt Bald Mountain, production was slightly lower compared with the previous quarter and increased year-over-year due to the timing of ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. Cost of sales per ounce sold was higher quarter-over-quarter primarily as a result of higher maintenance costs, and largely in line year-over-year.\n\nDevelopment Projects and Exploration\n\nGreat Bear\n\nAt the Great Bear project, the Company\u2019s robust exploration program continues to make excellent progress, execution planning for the Advanced Exploration (AEX) program is well underway, permitting continues to advance, and the PEA is expected to be released in September 2024.\n\nThe drilling results described below (true width) continue to support the view of a high-grade, long-life mining complex at Great Bear, with recent results showing extension of mineralization at depth across multiple zones.\n\nAt Yuma, the deepest drill hole on the property to date, BR-888C2, has intersected 3.8m @ 9.52 g/t Au, along the predicted plunge of the zone at a vertical depth of 1,575m below surface. Also at Yuma, drill hole BR-695C3A intersected 10.3m @ 23.76 g/t at 1,285m vertical depth.\n\nAt Yauro, recent successful results received follow-up drill testing this quarter. Of note, drill hole BR-770C3 intersected 22.7m @ 6.51 g/t at a vertical depth of 1,000m below surface demonstrating continuity of mineralization at depth.\n\nMineralization at Discovery continues to expand with recent drill results, including BR-896 and BR-898A, which intersected 5.4m @ 7.82 g/t at 700m vertical depth and 5.2m @ 3.92 g/t at 780m vertical depth, respectively.\n\nDrilling at Hinge and Limb this quarter has returned promising results for depth extension at both zones, providing optionality to supplement LP production in the future. At Hinge, drill holes DL-132C1 and DL-132C4 crossed quartz veins containing high-grade mineralization with DL-132C1 intersecting 3.1m @ 9.33 g/t at 850m vertical depth and DL-132C4 intersecting 3.1m @ 22.65 g/t at 865m vertical depth. At Limb, drill holes DL-132C1 and DL-132C3 intersected 5.0m @ 5.52 g/t at 720m vertical depth and 2.4m @ 4.54 g/t at 800m vertical depth, directly below the existing resource indicating mineralization remains open at depth.\n\nThe 2024 drill program will continue to target mineralization below the existing mineral resource, explore for additional deposits along strike, and expand the Red Lake style mineralization at Hinge and Limb.\r\nNotable exploration results at Great Bear in the second quarter include:\n\nBR-695C3A (Yuma) 10.3m @ 23.76 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 1,285m\n\nincluding 3.6m @ 65.51 g/t Au BR-770C3 (Yauro) 22.7m @ 6.51 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 1,000m\n\nincluding 3.5m @ 37.83 g/t Au BR-888C2 (Yuma) 10.7m @ 3.88 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 1,575m\n\nincluding 3.8m @ 9.52 g/t Au BR-896 (Discovery) 5.4m @ 7.82 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 700m BR-898A (Discovery) 5.2m @ 3.92 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 780m DL-132C1 (Hinge) 3.1m @ 9.33 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 850m\n\nand (Limb) 5.0m @ 5.52 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 720m DL-132C3 (Limb) 2.4m @ 4.54 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 800m DL-132C4 (Hinge) 3.1m @ 22.65 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 865m\n\nFor the AEX program, permitting, detailed engineering, execution planning, and procurement continue to advance. Kinross is targeting the start of surface construction in the second half of 2024. Construction of the underground decline is planned to commence in mid-2025.\n\nFor the Main Project, Kinross continues to advance technical studies, including engineering and field test work campaigns. In the last quarter, metallurgical, geochemistry and backfill test work was advanced to continue building technical knowledge and provide input into engineering studies.\n\nKinross is on track to release its PEA in September 2024. The PEA will provide visibility into the potential production scale, construction capital, all-in sustaining cost and margins for both the open pit and the underground. The PEA will only include a subset of the ounces in the measured, indicated, and inferred resources drilled to date.\n\nThe Draft Tailored Impact Statement Guidelines for the Main Project were received from the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada in Q2 2024, as planned, and the Federal Impact Assessment is underway. Studies are ongoing and the Company expects to file its Impact Statement in the first half of 2025.\n\nSelected Great Bear Drill Results\r\nSee Appendix A for full results.\n\nHole ID  From \r\n(m) To \r\n(m) Width \r\n(m) True \r\nWidth (m)  Au (g/t) Target  BR-695C3A 1,523.1 1,526.1 3.0 2.3 0.50 Yuma BR-695C3A 1,539.6 1,542.6 3.0 2.3 0.92 BR-695C3A 1,552.9 1,566.6 13.8 10.3 23.76 BR-695C3A Including 1,553.9 1,558.8 4.8 3.6 65.51 BR-770C3 1,308.4 1,312.2 3.9 3.0 0.60 Yauro BR-770C3 1,317.9 1,334.0 16.2 12.4 0.49 BR-770C3 1,353.1 1,382.5 29.5 22.7 6.51 BR-770C3 Including 1,357.6 1,362.1 4.5 3.5 37.83 BR-770C3 1,393.5 1,396.5 3.0 2.3 0.69 BR-770C3 1,409.5 1,417.0 7.5 5.8 0.85 BR-770C3 1,440.5 1,445.5 5.0 3.9 0.57 BR-770C3 1,456.4 1,483.4 27.0 20.8 0.53 BR-770C3 1,570.7 1,574.5 3.8 2.9 1.75 BR-770C3 1,601.7 1,614.8 13.1 10.1 0.57 BR-888C2 1,990.4 1,997.2 6.9 6.0 0.69 Yuma BR-888C2 2,008.2 2,020.6 12.3 10.7 3.88 BR-888C2 Including 2,009.3 2,013.6 4.3 3.8 9.52 BR-896 860.4 916.7 56.3 44.5 1.86 Discovery BR-896 Including 881.6 888.4 6.8 5.4 7.82 BR-896 1,132.3 1,133.8 1.5 1.2 27.60 BR-898A 880.5 936.0 55.6 48.9 1.01 Discovery BR-898A Including 928.6 934.5 5.9 5.2 3.92 BR-898A 978.0 986.3 8.3 7.3 0.47 BR-898A 997.3 1,008.6 11.4 10.0 1.36 BR-898A 1,014.0 1,043.0 29.0 25.5 2.30 BR-898A Including 1,032.0 1,034.3 2.3 2.0 3.13 BR-898A And including 1,039.5 1,041.5 2.0 1.8 15.56 BR-898A 1,060.5 1,065.0 4.5 4.0 0.68 DL-132C1 859.5 871.5 12.1 10.2 2.88 Hinge/Limb DL-132C1 Including 859.5 865.4 5.9 5.0 5.52 DL-132C1 1,044.7 1,051.5 6.8 5.8 5.47 DL-132C1 Including 1,044.7 1,048.3 3.6 3.1 9.33 DL-132C1 1,136.6 1,140.7 4.1 3.4 1.18 DL-132C3 913.4 925.4 12.1 9.8 1.61 Limb DL-132C3 Including 920.1 923.0 3.0 2.4 4.54 DL-132C4 885.3 888.7 3.5 2.9 0.55 Hinge DL-132C4 1,043.1 1,059.0 15.9 13.4 6.08 DL-132C4 Including 1,043.1 1,046.8 3.7 3.1 22.65\n\nResults are preliminary in nature and are subject to on-going QA/QC. Lengths are subject to rounding.\n\nSee Appendix B for a LP long section.\n\nFort Knox \u2013 Manh Choh\n\nAt the Kinross-operated, 70%-owned Manh Choh project, processing of ore at the Fort Knox mill began in early July and the first gold bar was poured on July 8, 2024, during a ceremony with the Native Village of Tetlin and Lieutenant Governor of Alaska, Nancy Dahlstrom. Ore transportation has ramped up to planned volumes, full commissioning of the mill modifications is expected to be completed in Q3, and the project remains on track to deliver planned production this year.\n\nRound Mountain\n\nThe extension work at Round Mountain is advancing well. At Phase S, mining remains on plan. For the heap leach pad expansion, earthworks and procurement are both complete while deployment of the geomembrane and overliner is advancing.\n\nAt Phase X, development of the exploration decline is progressing well, with over 2,200 metres\u00a0developed to date. Infill drilling on the primary Phase X target began during the second quarter, as planned, alongside continued opportunity drilling outside of the primary Phase X exploration target to extend zones of mineralization. The Company expects to begin receiving the results from within the target mineralization in the third quarter.\n\nThe drilling in Q2 has shown exciting results, demonstrating strong grades and widths:\n\nDX-0052 (from 0m to 32.4m): 32.4m @ 29.6g/t Au Eq DX-0052 (from 40.5m to 63.4m): 22.9m @ 11.5 g/t Au Eq DX-0053: 18.9m @ 12.3g/t Au Eq DX-0040: 20.1m @ 6.5 g/t Au Eq DX-0054: 14.6m @ 5.3 g/t Au Eq\n\nThese results continue to indicate upside potential for expansion of the target area for mineralization and for the potential of future mining at Phase X.\u00a0Watch a Round Mountain Phase X animation here.\n\nCurlew Basin exploration\n\nAt Curlew, Kinross\u2019 exploration program continued to show positive results at both the Stealth and Roadrunner zones.\n\nResults at Stealth continued to show zones of wider mineralization with strong grades. Drilling is still underway and will continue through the second half of the year. Intercepts to date in 2024 include (true width):\n\n1447: 18.7m @ 13.7 g/t Au, includes 4.7m @ 19.4 g/t Au, and 1.4m @ 22.2 g/t Au 1447: 6.1m @ 20.9 g/t Au, includes 1.5m @ 56.7 g/t Au 1448: 4.6m @ 14.3 g/t Au, includes 1.5m @ 20.7 g/t Au\n\nDelineation drilling at the Roadrunner zone continues with drilling from both surface and underground platforms to document the geometry and continuity. The mineralization at Roadrunner was intercepted again in Q2, as highlighted below:\n\n1442: 2.4m @ 12.5 g/t\n\nChile\n\nKinross\u2019 activities in Chile are currently focused on La Coipa and potential opportunities to extend its mine life. The\u00a0Lobo-Marte\u00a0project continues to provide optionality as a potential large, low-cost mine upon the conclusion of mining at La Coipa. While the Company focuses its technical resources on La Coipa, it will continue to engage and build relationships with communities related to Lobo-Marte and government stakeholders.\n\nSustainability\n\nKinross published its 2023\u00a0Climate Report, providing comprehensive climate-related disclosures and the Company\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 2023. The Climate Report can be accessed here: www.kinross.com/2023-Climate-Report\n\nKinross continued to advance its Climate Change Strategy during 2023 and is on track to achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity per ounce, over the 2021 baseline, by 2030. Efforts will continue to further reduce emissions intensity. The Climate Report details the Company\u2019s progress towards the targets outlined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement and our performance on Kinross\u2019 Climate Change Strategy.\n\nThe Climate Report continues to adhere to reporting best practices and ensure that stakeholders have comprehensive information about Kinross\u2019 global efforts to reduce emissions and address the impacts of climate change. Reporting has been in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards since 2007, and in alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2020. The 2023 Climate Report begins the process of alignment with the International Sustainability Standards Board\u2019s IFRS S2 Climate-Related Disclosures standard, which replaces the previous TCFD framework.\n\nAcross the Kinross portfolio, all sites and projects maintained a focus on managing climate risk, proactively developing solutions for energy efficiency and contributing to resiliency in host communities. An update of climate risk was completed for all sites and the Company\u2019s renewable energy strategy progressed well, including the completion of a solar power plant at Tasiast. The Company contributed to community resiliency through continued development of solar energy solutions for Colla indigenous communities in Chile, provision of water for semi-nomadic communities near Tasiast, and ongoing engagement with communities and farmers in Paracatu, through the local watershed committee.\n\nClimate-related opportunities are being considered in the planning for the Great Bear project, where the Company is focused on integrating best practices in energy efficiency and low-carbon emissions technologies, mining techniques and environmental stewardship. Energy considerations are being embedded in the proposed design with a focus on mine and mill process optimization, studying electrification of the underground, and energy efficient infrastructure. In the surface design, there is a strong focus on water management, water treatment and water stewardship. Additional design considerations for Great Bear will be reflected in its PEA.\n\nConference call details\n\nIn connection with this news release, Kinross will hold a conference call and audio webcast on Thursday, August 1, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. EDT to discuss the results, followed by a question-and-answer session.

(g)\u00a0The Fort Knox segment is composed of Fort Knox and Manh Choh, and comparative results shown are presented in accordance with the current year\u2019s presentation. Manh Choh tonnes of ore processed and grade were nil for all periods presented as production commenced in July 2024. The attributable results for Fort Knox include 100% of Fort Knox and 70% of Manh Choh.\n\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and ratios\n\nThe Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios in this document. These financial measures and ratios are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these financial measures and ratios, together with financial measures and ratios determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these financial measures and ratios is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures and ratios are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\r\n\r\nAdjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted Net Earnings per Share\n\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios which determine the performance of the Company, excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period, such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, reassessment of prior year taxes and/or taxes otherwise not related to the current period, impairment charges (reversals), gains and losses and other one-time costs related to acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions, and non-hedge derivative gains and losses. Although some of the items are recurring, the Company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Management believes that these measures and ratios, which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results, provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance, particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance. However, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share measures and ratios are not necessarily indicative of net earnings and earnings per share measures and ratios as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts) Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net earnings attributable to common shareholders - as reported $ 210.9 $ 151.0 $ 317.9 $ 241.2 Adjusting items: Foreign exchange (gains) losses (6.4 ) 10.1 (9.9 ) 6.3 Foreign exchange losses (gains) on translation of tax basis and foreign exchange on deferred income taxes within income tax expense 20.3 (18.5 ) 24.3 (31.7 ) Loss on sale of assets - - - - Taxes in respect of prior periods (30.7 ) 16.6 (22.7 ) 28.6 Insurance recoveries (22.9 ) (0.8 ) (22.9 ) (0.8 ) Other(a) 4.9 12.4 15.4 15.2 Tax effects of the above adjustments (1.4 ) (3.2 ) (2.5 ) (3.6 ) (36.2 ) 16.6 (18.3 ) 14.0 Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders $ 174.7 $ 167.6 $ 299.6 $ 255.2 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 1,229.0 1,227.6 1,228.6 1,226.3 Adjusted net earnings per share $ 0.14 $ 0.14 $ 0.24 $ 0.21 Basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders - as reported $ 0.17 $ 0.12 $ 0.26 $ 0.20 (a) Other includes various impacts, such as one-time costs at sites, restructuring costs, legal settlements and gains and losses on hedges and the sale of assets, which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period.\n\nAttributable Free Cash Flow\n\nAttributable free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash flow provided from operating activities less attributable capital expenditures and non-controlling interest included in net cash flows provided from operating activities. The Company believes that this measure, which is used internally to evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying cash generation performance and the ability to repay creditors and return cash to shareholders, provides investors with the ability to better evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying performance. However, this measure is not necessarily indicative of operating earnings or net cash flow provided from operating activities as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of attributable free cash flow for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars) Three months ended\r\nJune 30, Six months ended\r\nJune 30, 2024  2023  2024  2023  Net cash flow provided from operating activities -as reported $ 604.0 $ 528.6  $ 978.4  $ 787.6 Adjusting items: Attributable(a) capital expenditures (264.5  )  (272.3  ) (496.6  )  (484.9  ) Non-controlling interest(b) cash flow used in operating activities 6.4  2.0 9.4  2.6 Attributable(a) free cash flow $ 345.9 $ 258.3 $ 491.2  $ 305.3  See pages 21 and 22 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAdjusted Operating Cash Flow\n\nAdjusted operating cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash flow provided from operating activities excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital. Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors, including the timing of tax payments. The Company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow-generating capability of the Company. However, the adjusted operating cash flow measure is not necessarily indicative of net cash flow provided from operating activities as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow for the periods presented:\n\nThree months ended Six months ended (unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars) June 30,  June 30,  2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash flow provided from operating activities - as reported $  604 $ 528.6 $  978.4 $ 787.6 Adjusting items: Insurance proceeds received in respect of prior years (22.9 ) -  (22.9 ) - Working capital changes: Accounts receivable and other assets (41 ) (42.2 ) (51.3 ) (87.6 ) Inventories (2.5 ) 39.9 (8.4 ) 83.1 Accounts payable and other liabilities, including income taxes paid (59.5 ) (67.2 ) 7.2 8.8 (125.9 ) (69.5 ) (75.4 ) 4.3 Adjusted operating cash flow $  478.1 $ 459.1 $  903 $ 791.9\n\nProduction Cost of Sales(l) per Ounce Sold on a By-Product Basis\n\nProduction cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP ratio which calculates the Company\u2019s non-gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs, rather than converting its non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production, as is the case in co-product accounting. Management believes that this ratio provides investors with the ability to better evaluate Kinross\u2019 production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by-product accounting rather than co-product accounting.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, \r\nexcept ounces and production cost of sales per equivalent ounce) Three months ended Six months ended June 30,  June 30,  2024 2023 2024 2023 Production cost of sales - as reported $ 536.1 $ 497.9 $ 1049 $ 981.8 Less: silver revenue(c) (36.7 ) (53.3 ) (75.8 ) (108.2 ) Production cost of sales net of silver by-product revenue $ 499.4 $ 444.6 $ 973.2 $ 873.6 Gold ounces sold 505,122 525,921 1,008,726 987,617 Total gold equivalent ounces sold 520,760 552,969 1,043,160 1,043,299 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold(d) $ 1029 $ 900 $ 1006 $ 941 Production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 989 $ 845 $ 965 $ 885\n\nSee pages 21 and 22 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAll-In Sustaining Cost(l) and Attributable All-In Cost per Ounce Sold on a By-Product Basis\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, as applicable, calculated based on guidance published by the World Gold Council (\u201cWGC\u201d). The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including Kinross. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these metrics. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, these measures and ratios presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures and ratios presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost measures complement existing measures and ratios reported by Kinross.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. The value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production, i.e. a by-product. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production. Sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs, including capitalized development, and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\n\nAll-in cost is comprised of all-in sustaining cost as well as operating expenditures incurred at locations with no current operation, or costs related to other non-sustaining activities, and capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis are calculated by adjusting production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, as follows:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars,\r\nexcept ounces and costs per ounce Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Production cost of sales - as reported $ 536.1 $ 497.9 $ 1,049.0 $ 981.8 Less: silver revenue(c) (36.7 ) (53.3 ) (75.8 ) (108.2 ) Production cost of sales net of silver by-product revenue $ 499.4 $ 444.6 $ 973.2 $ 873.6 Adjusting items: General and administrative(e) 32.4 32.0 63.1 56.4 Other operating expense - sustaining(f) 1.6 5.0 2.4 11.5 Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(g) 19.4 18.3 37.7 32.6 Exploration and business development - sustaining(h) 13.1 9.5 21.8 16.1 Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(i) 116.5 148.6 225.8 245.1 Lease payments - sustaining(j) 3.3 5.5 6.7 20.7 All-in Sustaining Cost on a by-product basis $ 685.7 $ 663.5 $ 1,330.7 $ 1,256.0 Adjusting items on an attributable(a) basis: Other operating expense - non-sustaining(f) 9.8 10.0 19.9 18.7 Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(g) 1.7 2.4 3.4 4.3 Exploration and business development - non-sustaining(h) 41.8 39.7 74.7 67.3 Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(i) 148.0 123.7 270.8 239.8 Lease payments - non-sustaining(j) 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.4 All-in Cost on a by-product basis - attributable(a) $ 887.1 $ 839.4 $ 1,699.6 $ 1,586.5 505,122 525,921 1,008,726 987,617 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold(d) $ 1,029 $ 900 $ 1,006 $ 941 All-in sustaining cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 1,357 $ 1,262 $ 1,319 $ 1,272 Attributable(a) all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 1,756 $ 1,596 $ 1,685 $ 1,606\n\nSee pages 21 and 22 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAll-In Sustaining Cost(l) and Attributable All-In Cost per Equivalent Ounce Sold\n\nThe Company also assesses its all-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis. Under these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, the Company\u2019s production of silver is converted into gold equivalent ounces and credited to total production.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost per equivalent ounce sold are calculated by adjusting production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, as follows:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, except ounces and costs per ounce) Three months ended Six months ended June 30, June 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Production cost of sales - as reported $ 536.1 $ 497.9 $ 1,049.0 $ 981.8 Adjusting items: General and administrative(e) 32.4 32.0 63.1 56.4 Other operating expense - sustaining(f) 1.6 5.0 2.4 11.5 Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(g) 19.4 18.3 37.7 32.6 Exploration and business development - sustaining(h) 13.1 9.5 21.8 16.1 Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(i) 116.5 148.6 225.8 245.1 Lease payments - sustaining(j) 3.3 5.5 6.7 20.7 All-in Sustaining Cost $ 722.4 $ 716.8 $ 1,406.5 $ 1,364.2 Adjusting items on an attributable(a) basis: Other operating expense - non-sustaining(f) 9.8 10.0 19.9 18.7 Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(g) 1.7 2.4 3.4 4.3 Exploration and business development - non-sustaining(h) 41.8 39.7 74.7 67.3 Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(i) 148.0 123.7 270.8 239.8 Lease payments - non-sustaining(j) 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.4 All-in Cost - attributable(a) $ 923.8 $ 892.7 $ 1,775.4 $ 1,694.7 Gold equivalent ounces sold 520,760 552,969 1,043,160 1,043,299 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold(d) $ 1,029 $ 900 $ 1,006 $ 941 All-in sustaining cost per equivalent ounce sold $ 1,387 $ 1,296 $ 1,348 $ 1,308 Attributable(a) all-in cost per equivalent ounce sold $ 1,774 $ 1,614 $ 1,702 $ 1,624\n\nSee pages 21 and 22 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nCapital Expenditures and Attributable Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are classified as either sustaining capital expenditures or non-sustaining capital expenditures, depending on the nature of the expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditures typically represent capital expenditures at existing operations including capitalized exploration costs and capitalized development unless related to major projects, ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and other capital expenditures and is calculated as total additions to property, plant and equipment (as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows), less non-sustaining capital expenditures. Non-sustaining capital expenditures represent capital expenditures for major projects, including major capital development projects at existing operations that are expected to materially benefit the operation, as well as enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Management believes the distinction between sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining expenditures is a useful indicator of the purpose of capital expenditures and this distinction is an input into the calculation of all-in sustaining costs per ounce and attributable all-in costs per ounce. The categorization of sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures is consistent with the definitions under the WGC all-in cost standard. Sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures are not defined under IFRS, however, the sum of these two measures total to additions to property, plant and equipment as disclosed under IFRS on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment per the statement of cash flow includes 100% of capital expenditures for Manh Choh. Attributable capital expenditures includes Kinross' 70% share of capital expenditures for Manh Choh. Management believes this to be a useful indicator of Kinross\u2019 cash resources utilized for capital expenditures.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the classification of capital expenditures for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars) Three months ended June 30, 2024 Tasiast\r\n (Mauritania) Paracatu \r\n(Brazil) La Coipa \r\n(Chile) Fort Knox(k) (USA) Round \r\nMountain \r\n(USA) Bald \r\nMountain \r\n(USA) Total \r\nUSA Other Total Sustaining capital expenditures $ 7.0 $ 44.6 $ 10.7 $ 47.6 $ 2.1 $ 4.4 $ 54.1 $ 0.1 $ 116.5 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 68.2 - - 41.6 35.1 0.2 76.9 12.6 157.7 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 75.2 $ 44.6 $ 10.7 $ 89.2 $ 37.2 $ 4.6 $ 131.0 $ 12.7 $ 274.2 Less: Non-controlling interest(b) $ - $ - $ - $ (9.7 ) $ - $ - $ (9.7 ) $ - $ (9.7 ) Attributable(a) capital expenditures $ 75.2 $ 44.6 $ 10.7 $ 79.5 $ 37.2 $ 4.6 $ 121.3 $ 12.7 $ 264.5 Three months ended June 30, 2023 Sustaining capital expenditures $ 9.1 $ 39.7 $ 19.9 $ 52.1 $ 10.5 $ 16.5 $ 79.1 $ 0.8 $ 148.6 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 72.8 - 3.4 38.2 - 14.9 53.1 4.0 133.3 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 81.9 $ 39.7 $ 23.3 $ 90.3 $ 10.5 $ 31.4 $ 132.2 $ 4.8 $ 281.9 Less: Non-controlling interest(b) $ - $ - $ - $ (9.6 ) $ - $ - $ (9.6 ) $ - $ (9.6 ) Attributable(a) capital expenditures $ 81.9 $ 39.7 $ 23.3 $ 80.7 $ 10.5 $ 31.4 $ 122.6 $ 4.8 $ 272.3 (unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars) Six months ended June 30, 2024 Tasiast\r\n (Mauritania) Paracatu \r\n(Brazil) La Coipa\r\n (Chile) Fort Knox(k) (USA) Round \r\nMountain\r\n (USA) Bald \r\nMountain \r\n(USA) Total \r\nUSA Other Total Sustaining capital expenditures $ 17.1 $ 64.2 $ 17.9 $ 85.3 $ 5.8 $ 36.8 $ 127.9 $ (1.3 ) $ 225.8 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 137.6 - - 82.5 50.7 0.2 133.4 19.3 290.3 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 154.7 $ 64.2 $ 17.9 $ 167.8 $ 56.5 $ 37.0 $ 261.3 $ 18.0 $ 516.1 Less: Non-controlling interest(b) $ - $ - $ - $ (19.5 ) $ - $ - $ (19.5 ) $ - $ (19.5 ) Attributable(a) capital expenditures $ 154.7 $ 64.2 $ 17.9 $ 148.3 $ 56.5 $ 37.0 $ 241.8 $ 18.0 $ 496.6 Six months ended June 30, 2023 Sustaining capital expenditures $ 23.7 $ 67.5 $ 21.5 $ 90.7 $ 17.9 $ 22.6 $ 131.2 $ 1.2 $ 245.1 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 122.8 - 27.2 67.4 - 34.0 101.4 6.6 258.0 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 146.5 $ 67.5 $ 48.7 $ 158.1 $ 17.9 $ 56.6 $ 232.6 $ 7.8 $ 503.1 Less: Non-controlling interest(b) $ - $ - $ - $ (18.2 ) $ - $ - $ (18.2 ) $ - $ (18.2 ) Attributable(a) capital expenditures $ 146.5 $ 67.5 $ 48.7 $ 139.9 $ 17.9 $ 56.6 $ 214.4 $ 7.8 $ 484.9\n\nSee pages 21 and 22 for details of the endnotes referenced within the tables above.\n\nEndnotes\n\n(a)\u00a0\u201cAttributable\u201d includes Kinross\u2019 share of Manh Choh (70%) free cash flow, costs and capital expenditures.\n\n(b)\u00a0\u201cNon-controlling interest\u201d represents the non-controlling interest portion in Manh Choh (30%) and other subsidiaries for which the Company\u2019s interest is less than 100% for cash flow from operating activities and capital expenditures.\n\n(c)\u00a0\u201cSilver revenue\u201d represents the portion of metal sales realized from the production of the secondary or by-product metal (i.e. silver). Revenue from the sale of silver, which is produced as a by-product of the process used to produce gold, effectively reduces the cost of gold production.\n\n(d)\u00a0\u201cProduction cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold.\n\n(e)\u00a0\u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d expenses are as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period. General and administrative expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required to be absorbed on a continuing basis for the effective operation and governance of the Company.\n\n(f)\u00a0\u201cOther operating expense \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cOther operating expense\u201d as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, less other operating and reclamation and remediation expenses related to non-sustaining activities as well as other items not reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. Other operating expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on the type and location of the expenditure incurred. The majority of other operating expenses that are incurred at existing operations are considered costs necessary to sustain operations, and are therefore classified as sustaining. Other operating expenses incurred at locations where there is no current operation or related to other non-sustaining activities are classified as non-sustaining.\n\n(g)\u00a0\u201cReclamation and remediation - sustaining\u201d is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets, and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines. Reclamation and remediation costs for development projects or closed mines are excluded from this amount and classified as non-sustaining.\n\n(h)\u00a0\u201cExploration and business development \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cExploration and business development\u201d expenses as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, less non-sustaining exploration and business development expenses. Exploration expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type and location of the exploration expenditure. Exploration expenditures within the footprint of operating mines are considered costs required to sustain current operations and so are included in sustaining costs. Exploration expenditures focused on new ore bodies near existing mines (i.e. brownfield), new exploration projects (i.e. greenfield) or for other generative exploration activity not linked to existing mining operations are classified as non-sustaining. Business development expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type of expense and requirement for general or growth related operations.\n\n(i)\u00a0\u201cAdditions to property, plant and equipment \u2013 sustaining\u201d and non-sustaining are as presented on pages 20 and 21. Non-sustaining capital expenditures included in the calculation of attributable all-in-cost includes Kinross\u2019 share of Manh Choh (70%) costs.\n\n(j)\u00a0\u201cLease payments \u2013 sustaining\u201d represents the majority of lease payments as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is made up of the principal and financing components of such cash payments, less non-sustaining lease payments. Lease payments for development projects or closed mines are classified as non-sustaining.\n\n(k)\u00a0The Fort Knox segment is composed of Fort Knox and Manh Choh for all periods presented.\n\n(l)\u00a0As production from Manh Choh commenced in July 2024, production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios for Manh Choh are nil for all periods presented. As a result, production cost of sales and all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios are equal to attributable production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios, as applicable.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nRecent LP zone assay results\n\nHole ID  From \r\n(m) To \r\n(m) Width \r\n(m) True \r\nWidth (m)  Au \r\n(g/t) Target  BR-695C3A 1,523.1 1,526.1 3.0 2.3 0.50 Yuma

Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the inaccuracy of any of the foregoing assumptions; fluctuations in the currency markets; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold or certain other commodities (such as fuel and electricity); price inflation of goods and services; changes in the discount rates applied to calculate the present value of net future cash flows based on country-specific real weighted average cost of capital; changes in the market valuations of peer group gold producers and the Company, and the resulting impact on market price to net asset value multiples; changes in various market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, gold or silver prices and lease rates, or global fuel prices, that could impact the mark-to-market value of outstanding derivative instruments and ongoing payments/receipts under any financial obligations; risks arising from holding derivative instruments (such as credit risk, market liquidity risk and mark-to-market risk); changes in national and local government legislation, taxation (including but not limited to income tax, advance income tax, stamp tax, withholding tax, capital tax, tariffs, value-added or sales tax, capital outflow tax, capital gains tax, windfall or windfall profits tax, production royalties, excise tax, customs/import or export taxes/duties, asset taxes, asset transfer tax, property use or other real estate tax, together with any related fine, penalty, surcharge, or interest imposed in connection with such taxes), controls, policies and regulations; the security of personnel and assets; political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Chile, Brazil, Mauritania or other countries in which Kinross does business or may carry on business; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, us; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and complete divestitures; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining, development or refining activities; employee relations; litigation or other claims against, or regulatory investigations and/or any enforcement actions, administrative orders or sanctions in respect of the Company (and/or its directors, officers, or employees) including, but not limited to, securities class action litigation in Canada and/or the United States, environmental litigation or regulatory proceedings or any investigations, enforcement actions and/or sanctions under any applicable anti-corruption, international sanctions and/or anti-money laundering laws and regulations in Canada, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction; the speculative nature of gold exploration and development including, but not limited to, the risks of obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses and permits; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; adverse changes in our credit ratings; and contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or the inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can directly or indirectly affect, and could cause, Kinross\u2019 actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Kinross, including but not limited to resulting in an impairment charge on goodwill and/or assets. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management\u2019s expectations and plans relating to the future.

        "title": "Air Products (APD) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. APD is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2024 results before the opening bell on Aug 1.\r\n\r\nThe industrial gas giant beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters while missing once. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 0.7%, on average. The company delivered an earnings surprise of around 4.8% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAir Products is expected to have gained from cost-improvement and productivity initiatives in the fiscal third quarter. Higher volumes in the Americas segment and pricing actions are also expected to have aided the company's performance amid headwinds from the sluggishness in Europe and China.\r\n\r\nAPD\u2019s shares have lost 13% in the past year compared with a 12% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter currently stands at $3,039.8 million, which suggests a rise of roughly 0.2% from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for the Americas segment\u2019s revenues is currently pegged at $1,279.6 million, indicating an increase of 1.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe same for the Asia segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $783.8 million, which suggests a 4.8% year-over-year decline.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for the Europe segment\u2019s revenues stands at $697.8 million, indicating a 1.3% year-over-year decline.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nAir Products is expected to have gained from volume gains and higher pricing in the Americas division in the quarter to be reported. Investments in high-return projects, new business deals, acquisitions and productivity measures are also likely to have aided the company\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nThe company remains focused on its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. These initiatives are likely to have contributed to its earnings and cash flows. APD is realizing the benefits of the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nAir Products is also driving productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to have supported its margins in the fiscal third quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, the slowdown in China and Europe might have affected the company\u2019s business in the to-be-reported quarter. The sluggish China economy is impacting volumes in the Industrial Gases - Asia segment. A slower economic recovery in China and the softness in electronics are likely to continue to have affected the segment\u2019s volumes. Air Products is also seeing weak demand for merchant products in Europe. This might have impacted volumes in the Europe segment in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Quote\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for APD this season.

        "content": "ANSYS Inc ANSS is scheduled to report results for the second quarter of 2024 on Jul 31, after the closing bell.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $1.94, unchanged in the past 60 days. The figure indicates an increase of 21.25% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $550.8 million, indicating growth of 10.91% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s levels.\r\n\r\nANSS\u2019 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter but surpassed in the earlier three quarters. It has a four-quarter average surprise of a negative 0.5%. ANSS\u2019 shares have lost 14.7% against the sub-industry\u2019s growth of 11.2% and the S&P 500 Index\u2019s rally of 14.8% in the year-to-date period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors at Play\n\nANSS witnesses healthy demand for its simulation solutions across major verticals such as aerospace & defense (A&D), high tech, automotive, industrial equipment and energy.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOngoing momentum in the A&D sector, owing to the evolving space sector and digital transformation, bodes well for the company\u2019s software solutions. In the automotive sector, higher demand for electric vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems solutions are likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are driving simulation software capabilities, unlocking potential growth avenues for the company. Continued momentum in the high-tech industry, fueled by ongoing development in AI, acts as a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical instability, forex volatility and global macroeconomic weakness remain headwinds.\r\n\r\nGiven the pending acquisition by Synopsys, as announced in January 2024, the company no longer provides guidance. However, it expects ACV and revenue growth rates to vary across the quarters in 2024 and be affected by the performance comparisons to 2023. For the remaining quarters of 2024, it expects ACV and revenues to grow in double digits.\n\nANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nANSYS, Inc. price-eps-surprise | ANSYS, Inc. Quote\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn Jul 18, 2024, ANSS expanded its collaboration with NVIDIA and Supermicro to offer Turnkey hardware solutions that exceptionally enhance Ansys Multiphysics simulation capabilities. This partnership focuses on customizing hardware for Ansys' simulation software, resulting in remarkable speed enhancements of up to 1,600 times in computational tasks.\r\n\r\nOn Jul 9, 2024, Ansys System Tool Kit, a cutting-edge software tailored for digital mission engineering and systems analysis, was made available in the AWS Marketplace by the company. The addition of Ansys STK in the AWS Marketplace will empower engineers to simulate complex systems in a 3D environment with high-resolution terrain, imagery and radio frequency data. \r\n\r\nOn Jun 20, 2024, ANSS introduced Ansys ConceptEV, a modern SaaS solution that provides an end-to-end, model-based approach to EV powertrain design. ConceptEV empowers system and component engineers to collaborate on a shared system model, enabling them to make informed design decisions on the whole powertrain concept.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ANSYS this time around.

        "title": "The Top 7 Under-$10 Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "As the summer of 2024 heats up, so does my excitement for under-$10 stocks. I believe these affordable picks strike a sweet spot between volatility and medium-term potential. Sure, penny stocks and most sub-$10 shares often get lumped together, and for good reason \u2013 many smaller companies have struggled in the market despite the broader rally. However, these budget-friendly stocks are still worth a closer look.\n\nWhy? They offer an enticing balance of risk and reward. Plus, as interest rates inevitably cool off in the coming quarters, it could be just the catalyst needed to push these stocks to new heights. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll be a smooth ride, but for those willing to buckle up, the potential payoff could be well worth it. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) is an online learning platform that offers courses in various fields to over 64 million learners worldwide. The company recently reported strong first-quarter 2024 results, with 24% year-over-year revenue growth in its Business segment and expansion to over 16,000 enterprise customers globally. This is the biggest segment now, as the Consumer segment has been declining.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Udemy revenue by segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe Udemy is well-positioned for long-term success as demand for online learning and upskilling continues. Analysts seem bullish on Udemy\u2019s prospects, with firms like Keybanc, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Needham maintaining positive ratings and price targets indicating significant upside. Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Brett Knoblauch reiterated an Overweight rating with a $20 price target, implying a 122% upside from current levels. While I\u2019m encouraged by the optimism, I would caution that such a lofty target may be overly ambitious in the near term.\n\nThat said, with Udemy guiding for profitability in 2024 and analysts projecting 54 cents in earnings per share in 2026, the current valuation of under 17x 2026 earnings looks quite reasonable for a high-growth software name. If Udemy executes well, there could still be plenty of room for upside.\n\nTaboola.com (TBLA) TBLA stock: Taboola company website with logo close up\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nTaboola (NASDAQ:TBLA) is an advertising technology company that provides content recommendation services. The company has been navigating a challenging environment, but I believe it is well-positioned to benefit from the accelerating shift of advertising dollars to digital channels.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, content consumption is increasingly moving online. People are spending more time than ever watching videos, reading articles and otherwise engaging with digital media. Naturally, advertisers are following suit by allocating larger portions of their budgets to online channels and sponsored content. This mega trend plays right into Taboola\u2019s wheelhouse. Despite near-term headwinds, Taboola delivered solid Q1 2024 results, beating the high end of its guidance across all key metrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenues grew 26% year-over-year to $414 million, while ex-TAC gross profit increased 20% to $139 million.\u00a0The company is making good progress on strategic priorities like ramping up its Yahoo partnership and driving advertiser success through AI-powered tools. The expected growth in the coming years is very promising, too. Taboola revenue chart\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nTaboola\u2019s stock has been flat over the past year and is down 17.6% year-to-date, but I view this as an attractive entry point.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), a Canadian-based gold mining company, has been striking it rich thanks to soaring gold prices. With economic uncertainty driving investors towards safe havens like gold, Kinross has seen its stock rise by 77% over the past year.\n\nThe company posted strong Q1 2024 results, with margins jumping 20% to $1,088 per ounce sold. The analyst consensus is bullish, but bears argue the stock may be getting ahead of itself. Personally, I\u2019m in the bull camp and believe gold prices have room to run.\n\nKinross is making smart moves, like investing in the promising Manh Choh project in Alaska. The company also published an impressive sustainability report to boost ESG.\n\nRegardless, Kinross\u2019 fortunes are closely tied to the price of gold. If the yellow metal loses its luster, expect KGC shares to follow suit. But for now, I\u2019m excited to see how this gold rush plays out. With Q2 results due out soon, Kinross investors could be in for another pleasant surprise.\n\nAware (AWRE) Aware (AWRE) logo displayed on a web browser and enlarged by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAware (NASDAQ:AWRE) receives limited analyst coverage, but those who follow it see long-term potential due to the increasing global need for secure biometric solutions. Craig-Hallum analyst Jeff Van Rhee recently reiterated his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Aware.\n\nHowever, Aware\u2019s financial performance has been volatile, and the company is still unprofitable. In Q1 2024, Aware reported a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue to $4.4 million, while its net loss improved to $1.0 million from $1.6 million in the prior year period. I believe that if Aware continues to execute on its strategy, it could reach profitability in the near future.\n\nThe rise of AI could disrupt many existing verification systems, potentially driving companies to rapidly adopt more advanced biometric solutions. This trend could benefit Aware as businesses turn to the company\u2019s expertise in biometric software.\n\nUP Fintech Holding (TIGR) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Fintech Stock Bargains. fintech stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\nUP Fintech Holding (NASDAQ:TIGR) operates an online brokerage platform focusing on global Chinese investors. The company has faced challenges in recent years, with its stock price down significantly from 2021 highs and trading mostly below $5 for over two years now.\n\nHowever, I believe UP Fintech is starting to turn things around financially and could deliver solid upside if it maintains its current trajectory. While the stock is flat year-to-date, I expect positive moves going forward as the company reported total revenue of $78.9 million in Q1 2024, a 19% increase year-over-year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income also saw significant growth.\n\nOf course, skepticism still abounds regarding the Chinese economy, but I don\u2019t necessarily view that as a negative for UP Fintech. As the \u201clargest online broker focusing on global Chinese investors in terms of U.S. securities trading volume,\u201d the company could actually benefit from Chinese investors increasingly looking abroad amidst a poorly performing Hang Seng Index.\n\nRed Cat Holdings (RCAT) Drone flying over landscape representing uvas stock\n\nSource: Rocksweeper / Shutterstock.com\n\nRed Cat Holdings (NSADAQ:RCAT) is a small drone drone startup. The company recently reported revenue of $5.8 million in fiscal Q3 2024, representing 250% year-over-year increase and marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth. The growth ahead looks solid, too. Under-$10 stocks: RCAT revenue estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn my view, Red Cat is a risky but intriguing investment for those seeking significant upside potential. This small drone player could hit pay dirt by landing hefty contracts as unmanned aerial vehicles gain popularity with government and military customers. After all, drones are already heavily utilized by law enforcement, and the Pentagon is just beginning to ramp up its drone deployments.\n\nRed Cat aims to replicate that manufacturing capability domestically, and I believe it could soar if successful. The company also recently secured $4.4 million in non-dilutive financing and is poised to join the Russell Microcap Index.\n\nAnalysts seem bullish on Red Cat, with Ladenburg Thalmann initiating coverage in June with a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and $4 price target, implying over 75% upside from here.\n\nPowerFleet (AIOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPowerFleet (NASDAQ:AIOT) provides IoT and AI solutions to optimize logistics operations. The company has been pivoting to a SaaS-centric business model centered around its Unity platform.\n\nI believe PowerFleet is well-positioned to benefit from the rapid digitization of the logistics industry. Companies are investing heavily in AI and software to maximize supply chain efficiency, and PowerFleet\u2019s device-agnostic Unity platform puts it in the sweet spot of this trend.\n\nThe market seems to be recognizing PowerFleet\u2019s potential. The stock has surged 76% over the past year as the company\u2019s recurring SaaS revenue gains traction. However, it still trades 42% below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAnalysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with all six covering the stock rating it a \u201cBuy.\u201d Canaccord Genuity nearly doubled its price target to $10, implying a 110% upside. While I\u2019m not quite that optimistic, I agree PowerFleet\u2019s valuation doesn\u2019t reflect its growth prospects in a booming industry.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Western Digital Corporation WDC is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nFor the to-be-reported quarter, management projects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 90 cents to $1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at earnings of $1.26 per share. WDC reported a loss per share of $1.98 in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $3.6-$3.8 billion. The consensus estimate is currently pegged at $3.77 billion, indicating an increase of 41.1% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s figure. \r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 61.6%, on average. In the past year, shares have gained 60.4% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 67.8%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors to Note\n\nWestern Digital\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from solid momentum in HDD driven by increasing demand for SMR portfolio. In the last reported quarter, the company noted that SMR-based drives represented 50% of nearline exabyte shipments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, the company expects flash revenues to improve sequentially as it is focused on optimizing bit shipments and ASP. Improving demand for SSD solutions is likely to have acted as a tailwind.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter HDD revenues is pegged at $1.829 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flash revenues is pegged at $1.875 billion for the same.\r\n\r\nLooking at end markets, the Cloud segment is likely to have gained from higher nearline shipments and increased nearline per unit pricing. Momentum in demand for SanDisk premium brand is likely to have cushioned revenues from the Consumer segment. The Client segment is likely to have gained from increased bit demand for flash-based solutions along with an increase in ASP. \r\n\r\nHowever, prevailing global macroeconomic uncertainties and increasing expenses remain concerning.\n\nWestern Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nWestern Digital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Western Digital this time around.

        "content": "Axcelis Technologies Inc ACLS is slated to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nACLS recently announced its preliminary second-quarter results, per which, now it expects revenues of more than $252 million while earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be more than $1.38. This compares with previously issued revenue guidance of $245 million and EPS of $1.30. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $252.4 million, which suggests a decline of 7.9% from a year ago. The consensus mark for EPS is pegged at $1.39, indicating a decrease of 25.3% from the prior-year level.\r\n\r\nACLS\u2019 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters by an average of 18.9%. In the past year, shares have lost 38.4% against the industry\u2019s growth of 0.7%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe company\u2019s performance in the second quarter is likely to have benefited from continued momentum in demand for its Purion\u2019s suite of products, especially in the silicon-carbide power market. The transition to electric vehicles has been driving the silicon carbide power device market. This, in turn, is boosting demand for Purion Power series products, especially PurionH200 silicon carbide, Purion XE silicon carbide systems and Purion M silicon carbide tool.\r\n\r\nAlso, Axcelis, while announcing preliminary results, highlighted that the Systems revenues for the second quarter came in better than expected, partly attributed to better conversion of evaluation systems to revenues. Customer shipments to China are likely to have acted as an additional tailwind. \r\n\r\nACLS\u2019 advanced Purion Product Extensions have been aiding it to gain further share in the image sensor and power device manufacturing space. With these product extensions in its portfolio, the company has been boasting implant products for both the silicon IGBT and silicon carbide power device market segments.\r\n\r\nSoftness in memory and other general mature process technologies remain concerning. Also, lower fab utilization is likely to have weighed on the CS&I segment revenues. \r\n\r\nVolatile supply-chain dynamics and global macroeconomic weakness are likely to have acted as additional headwinds along with increasing expenses toward research and development and infrastructure.\n\nAxcelis Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Axcelis Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAxcelis Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Axcelis Technologies, Inc. Quote\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn June 2024, Axcelis expanded business operations in Japan by setting up new service offices. These offices, located in Chitose, Hokkaido and Kumamoto, Kyushu, will support the ACLS\u2019 growing client base in the country.\r\n\r\nACLS noted that its service centers, which will facilitate localized support resources for the Purion ion implant equipment, while in production, are located near the customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Axcelis this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.\u00a0\r\n\r\nACLS has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are a few stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital Corporation WDC has an Earnings ESP of +31.75% and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "Albemarle (ALB) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Albemarle Corporation ALB will release second-quarter 2024 results after the closing bell on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nThe company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters while missing twice. In this timeframe, it delivered an earnings surprise of 26.7%, on average. It posted a negative earnings surprise of roughly 25.7% in the last reported quarter. ALB is likely to have benefited from higher lithium volumes and its cost and productivity actions in the second quarter amid headwinds from softer lithium market prices.\r\n\r\nAlbemarle\u2019s shares have lost 56.3% over a year compared with a 12% decline of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Albemarle for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1,401.1 million, reflecting a decline of around 40.9% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for net sales for the Energy Storage unit for the second quarter is pegged at $822.6 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 53%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sale for the Specialties unit is pinned at $309.9 million, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 16.5%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Ketjen unit stands at $259.6 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 10%.\n\nSome Factors to Watch For\n\nAlbemarle is likely to have benefited from higher volumes in its lithium business in the quarter to be reported. Healthy customer demand, capacity expansion and plant productivity improvements are expected to have supported volumes. The La Negra III/IV expansion in Chile and and the processing plant in Qinzhou, China are likely to have contributed to volumes. Albemarle, on its first-quarter call, said that volume growth in Energy Storage is trending toward the high end of its earlier provided 10-20% year-over-year growth outlook for 2024.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the benefits of ALB\u2019s cost-saving, pricing and productivity initiatives are expected to get reflected in the June quarter. Its cost and productivity actions are expected to have supported margins in the quarter. Efforts to drive operating efficiency and improve the utilization of raw materials are likely to have aided the company\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, weaker lithium market prices are likely to have impacted the company\u2019s performance. Lithium prices have declined amid slowing demand growth for electric vehicles, inventory glut and increased supply.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s Specialties unit is likely to have faced headwinds from demand weakness in the quarter to be reported. The segment faces demand headwinds in the consumer electronics market. The demand weakness is expected to have continued in the second quarter. \r\n\r\nThe results in the Ketjen unit are likely to have been aided by higher volumes and prices. The strength in clean fuel technology and higher refinery utilization are expected to have aided volumes in this segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlbemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Albemarle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlbemarle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Albemarle Corporation Quote\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ALB this season.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 26, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Hanesbrands HBI, Eldorado Gold EGO and Kinross Gold KGC.\n\n3 Solid \"Breakout Stocks\" to Buy Now\n\nActive investors should pick breakout stocks for excellent returns. This method involves zeroing in on stocks whose prices vary within a narrow band.\n\nIf the stock price falls below this channel, it could be the best time to sell it off. However, the best time to buy a stock per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band. Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains.\n\nTo that end, Hanesbrands, Eldorado Gold and Kinross Gold have been selected as the breakout stocks for today.\n\nZeroing in on Breakout Stocks\n\nTo select the right breakout stock, one has to calculate its support and resistance level. A support level is the lower bound for stock movements, while a resistance level refers to the maximum price it trades within a considerable period.\n\nIn other words, the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level, which means that most traders are willing to sell it. Most traders are prepared to go long on the stock at the resistance level, meaning they would like to add them to their portfolio. The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or have just broken above the resistance level.\n\nHas a Genuine Breakout Occurred?\n\nThe primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed. When a stock moves above the resistance level, it should be a highly prized commodity for traders. However, whether such a breakout is genuine is another matter altogether.\n\nFor a bona fide breakout, the stock's earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level. This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long-term price trends.\n\nThe strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study. Despite the risk of misidentification, correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns, even at a price that may not seem attractive at first glance.\n\nThese criteria narrow the universe of more than 6,853 stocks to only 32. Here are the top three stocks:\n\nHanesbrands\n\nHanesbrands engages in the design, manufacture, sourcing and sale of apparel essentials for men, women and children in the United States and internationally. HBI currently carries a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 666.7% for the current year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEldorado Gold\n\nEldorado Gold is a gold-producing and exploration company with gold assets in Brazil and Turkey. EGO currently carries a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 112.3% for the current year.\n\nKinross Gold\n\nKinross Gold is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. KGC currently carries a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.6% for the current year.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "content": "DuPont de Nemours, Inc. DD is scheduled to come up with second-quarter 2024 results, before the opening bell on Jul 31.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. In this timeframe, it delivered an earnings surprise of roughly 9%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of roughly 21.5% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nDuPont is expected to have benefited from its innovation-driven investment and productivity actions in the second quarter. However, its results are likely to reflect the impacts of demand weakness in specific businesses.\r\n\r\nDuPont\u2019s shares are up 1.6% over a year compared with the 11.7% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the second quarter for DuPont is currently pinned at $3,035.8 million, suggesting an expected year-over-year decline of 1.9%.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for the company\u2019s Electronics & Industrial segment is pinned at $1,408.4 million, indicating a 7.4% year-over-year rise. The same for the Water & Protection unit is pegged at $1,359.5 million, suggesting a 9% year-over-year decline.\n\nSome Factors to Watch For\n\nDuPont is likely to have benefited from its cost and productivity measures and actions to drive growth through innovation in the quarter to be reported. Savings from its restructuring actions are expected to have aided its performance.\u00a0 DD is also expected to have gained from its pricing actions. Moreover, the Spectrum Plastics Group acquisition is likely to have contributed to second-quarter results.\r\n\r\nHowever, DuPont\u2019s water business is exposed to headwinds from the slowdown in China. Its water solutions business is likely to have seen sales moderation in the June quarter due to softer demand in China resulting from the slowdown in the industrial economy and inventory de-stocking. Weaker water demand in China is likely to have continued in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company expects de-stocking within industrial-based end markets in the second quarter. It sees sales in the Water & Protection unit to decline by high-single digits in the second quarter factoring in the de-stocking impact in water solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Solutions business is also being challenged by de-stocking within biopharma applications. DuPont is expected to have witnessed additional channel inventory de-stocking within its industrial-based businesses in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuPont de Nemours, Inc.

        "content": "Olin Corporation OLN posted a second-quarter 2024 profit of $74.2 million or 62 cents per share, down from $146.9 million or $1.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents.\r\n\r\nThe chemical maker\u2019s revenues fell roughly 3.5% year over year to $1,644 million in the quarter. It also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,712.3 million. The top line in the reported quarter was hurt by lower pricing in its chemical businesses. The company witnessed lower sales across its segments in the quarter.\n\nOlin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nOlin Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Olin Corporation Quote\n\nSegment Review\n\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls: In the second quarter of 2024, revenues amounted to $920.3 million, which fell around 8.2% year over year. The segment\u2019s results were adversely impacted by lower caustic soda pricing. Moreover, the second-quarter 2024 segment sales and results for Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls were negatively impacted by the maintenance turnaround and subsequent operating issues with the vinyl chloride monomer plant at the Freeport, TX facility, resulting in higher costs and lower profit from lost sales. The reported figure fell short of the consensus estimate of $995.4 million.\r\n\r\nEpoxy: Revenues in the division went down around 4.8% year over year to $317.7 million. Sales decreased due to lower product pricing, slightly offset by increased volume. It missed the consensus estimate of $353 million.\r\n\r\nWinchester: Revenues rose around 10.7% year over year to $406 million. Sales increased due to higher international military sales, military project revenue and White Flyer sales, slightly offset by decreasing commercial ammunition sales. It missed the consensus estimate of $424 million.\n\nFinancials\n\nThe cash balance at the end of the second quarter was $182.1 million. In the reported quarter, Olin had roughly $2.7 billion in net debt. In the first half of 2024, net debt increased by $229 million, owing to seasonal working capital.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, the company repurchased roughly 1.9 million shares of common stock for $106 million. Olin had approximately $0.8 billion available for repurchases under the buyback authorization at the end of the quarter.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe company reported that the improvement in demand in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls business has been slower than anticipated earlier this year. Olin's second-half 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be flat with the first half, based on OLN\u2019s current expectation and prior to considering the effects of Hurricane Beryl. The company's disciplined capital allocation approach, backed by a strong financial basis and sustained cash flow, will ensure continued shareholder returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Olin have lost 13.8% in the past year against an 11.7% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nOlin currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\r\n\r\nBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, Ero Copper Corp.

        "content": "Eastman Chemical Company EMN recorded a second-quarter 2024 profit of $230 million or $1.94 per share compared with $272 million or $2.27 in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nBarring one-time items, earnings were $2.15 per share, up from $1.99 in the year-ago quarter. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99.\r\n\r\nRevenues increased roughly 1.7% year over year to $2,363 million in the quarter. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,369.3 million. Sales volume increased slightly, led by durables and automotive end markets and was also aided by the end of customer inventory destocking in most end markets. The improvement was partly offset by the weakness in the building and construction end markets.\n\nEastman Chemical Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nEastman Chemical Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Eastman Chemical Company Quote\n\nSegment Review\n\nRevenues from the Additives and Functional Products division declined 3.9% year over year to $718 million in the reported quarter. Lower selling prices were attributed to the fall in raw material prices, including cost-pass-through contracts for care additives and functional amines. Sales volume remained constant, with an increase in coatings and care additives offsetting a fall in specialized fluids due to reduced heat transfer fluid project fulfillments. The figure was higher than our estimate of $715.3 million.\r\n\r\nRevenues from the Advanced Materials unit increased 7.6% year over year to $795 million in the reported quarter. Sales volume rose due to the end of customer inventory destocking in durables and packaging markets, as well as premium interlayer product growth in the automotive market. This increase was somewhat offset by decreased selling prices. The figure was higher than our estimate of $733.8 million.\r\n\r\nChemical Intermediates sales were flat year over year at $515 million. The end-of-customer inventory destocking was the primary factor driving higher sales volume across the segment. Decreased raw material and energy prices led to lower selling prices, especially for acetyls and intermediates goods, despite higher sales volume. The figure was marginally lower than our estimate of $515.5 million.\r\n\r\nFibers segment sales increased 2.2% year over year to $330 million. Higher selling prices were triggered by acetate price rises. Sales volume mainly jumped owing to expansion in the textiles product line. The figure was lower than our estimate of $371.5 million.\n\nFinancials\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, operating activities generated $367 million in cash. The company returned $195 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuidance\n\nThe company anticipates a $50 million incremental EBITDA contribution from its Kingsport methanolysis facility. It expects EPS for 2024 to be between $7.40 and $7.85. Furthermore, EMN expects to deliver around $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in 2024.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nEastman Chemical\u2019s shares have risen 10.9% over a year compared with an 11.7% decline of the industry.

        "title": "3 Solid Breakout Stocks to Buy Now: HBI, EGO, KGC",
        "content": "Active investors should pick breakout stocks for excellent returns. This method involves zeroing in on stocks whose prices vary within a narrow band.\n\nIf the stock price falls below this channel, it could be the best time to sell it off. However, the best time to buy a stock per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band. Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains.\n\nTo that end, Hanesbrands HBI, Eldorado Gold EGO and Kinross Gold KGC have been selected as the breakout stocks for today.\n\nZeroing in on Breakout Stocks\n\nTo select the right breakout stock, one has to calculate its support and resistance level. A support level is the lower bound for stock movements, while a resistance level refers to the maximum price it trades within a considerable period.\n\nIn other words, the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level, which means that most traders are willing to sell it. Most traders are prepared to go long on the stock at the resistance level, meaning they would like to add them to their portfolio. The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or have just broken above the resistance level.\n\nHas a Genuine Breakout Occurred?\n\nThe primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed. When a stock moves above the resistance level, it should be a highly prized commodity for traders. However, whether such a breakout is genuine is another matter altogether.\n\nFor a bona fide breakout, the stock\u2019s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level. This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long-term price trends.\n\nThe strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study. Despite the risk of misidentification, correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns, even at a price that may not seem attractive at first glance.\n\nScreening Criteria Using Research Wizard:\n\n\u2022 Percentage price change over four weeks between 10% and 20% (Stocks showing considerable price increases but whose gains are not excessive.)\n\n\u2022 Current Price /52-Week High greater than or equal to 0.9 (Stocks trading 90% close to their 52-week highs.)\n\n\u2022 Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\n\nWhether the market is good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2022 Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2\n\n(Stocks that move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit.)\n\n\u2022 Current price less than or equal to $20 (Stocks reasonably priced.)\n\nThese criteria narrow the universe of more than 6,853 stocks to only 32. Here are the top three stocks:\n\nHanesbrands\n\nHanesbrands engages in the design, manufacture, sourcing and sale of apparel essentials for men, women and children in the United States and internationally. HBI currently carries a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 666.7% for the current year.\n\nEldorado Gold\n\nEldorado Gold is a gold-producing and exploration company with gold assets in Brazil and Turkey. EGO currently carries a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 112.3% for the current year.\n\nKinross Gold\n\nKinross Gold is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. KGC currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.

DOW logged profits (on a reported basis) of $439 million or 62 cents per share in second-quarter 2024, down from a profit of $485 million or 68 cents per share a year ago.\r\n\r\nBarring one-time items, adjusted earnings were 68 cents per share for the reported quarter, down from 75 cents a year ago. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents.\r\n \r\nDow recorded net sales of $10,915 million for the quarter, down 4% year over year. It also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,960.3 million. The top line was hurt by lower local pricing, which more than offset higher volumes. \r\n\r\nVolumes were up 1% year over year driven by gains in the U.S. & Canada. This marked the third straight quarter of year-over-year volume growth. Local prices fell 4% year over year in the reported quarter. DOW faced headwinds from demand softness in Europe and Asia in the quarter.\n\nDow Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dow Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nDow Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Dow Inc. Quote\n\nSegment Highlights\n\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics: The division\u2019s sales fell 7% year over year to $5,515 million in the reported quarter. The figure was below our estimate of $5,592.8 million. Volumes were down 3% year over year as a decline in merchant hydrocarbon sales more than offset higher demand for functional polymers and polyethylene. Local prices fell 4% due to reduced downstream polymer prices. In the packaging and specialty plastics business, increased demand for industrial, consumer and flexible food packaging was more than offset by reduced prices, especially in infrastructure and mobility markets.\r\n\r\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure: Sales for the unit declined 7% year over year to $2,951 million. The figure was below our estimate of $3,065.8 million. Local prices fell 7% in the quarter. Volumes rose 1% on gains in polyurethanes and construction chemicals.\r\n\r\nPerformance Materials & Coatings: Revenues from the division rose 2% year over year to $2,243 million. The figure was above our estimate of $2,240.9 million. Volumes rose 7% while local prices went down 4%. Volumes increased on gains in all businesses and geographic regions.\n\nFinancials\n\nDow had cash and cash equivalents of $3,341 million at the end of the quarter, down around 10% from the prior quarter. Long-term debt was $16,016 million, down around 1% sequentially.\r\n\r\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $832 million in the reported quarter, down from $1,347 million in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nDow also returned $691 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nMoving ahead, Dow said that it is focused on delivering sequential earnings improvements while navigating through the slower global macroeconomic environment in the second half of 2024. While DOW is seeing growing demand in many markets that it serves, it does not expect a significant change in demand in building & construction and consumer durables in 2024. It will continue driving higher sales through its innovation portfolio and diverse product mix. DOW remains on track to deliver higher earnings and shareholder returns by leveraging its global scale, strategically advantaged cost positions and growth investments. DOW sees third-quarter net sales of around $11.1 billion.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nDOW\u2019s shares are down 0.7% in a year compared with the industry\u2019s 11% decline.

        "title": "Sandstorm Gold (SAND) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Sandstorm Gold (SAND) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis provider of financing for gold mining companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +100%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $40.5 million, down 18.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sandstorm Gold?\n\nFor Sandstorm Gold, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.28%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sandstorm Gold will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sandstorm Gold would post earnings of $0.01 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.01, delivering a surprise of -200%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nSandstorm Gold doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nKinross Gold (KGC), another stock in the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.13 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -7.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.02 billion, down 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Kinross Gold has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 8.04%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Kinross Gold will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC)\n\nBased in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. It ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the world, with a 2023 production of around 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces. The company's operations are primarily located in - the Americas (roughly 71% of 2023 production). It holds major assets in Canada and the United States. It is mainly involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. Kinross also produces and sells silver.\n\nKGC sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Mining - Gold industry's P/E of 15.8X, shares of Kinross Gold are trading at a forward P/E of 15.6X. KGC also has a PEG Ratio of 0.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 7.1X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 2.5X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.07 to $0.57 per share. KGC has an average earnings surprise of 46%.\n\nWith strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding KGC to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Valmont Industries, Inc. VMI reported a second-quarter 2024 profit of roughly $99.7 million or $4.91 per share, up from $89.4 million or $4.21 per share in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nBarring one-time items, adjusted earnings per share were $4.76, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04.\r\n\r\nThe upside in earnings can be attributed to pricing actions, cost management and operational efficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s revenues were $1,039.7 million in the quarter, down 0.6% year over year. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,055 million.\n\nValmont Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nValmont Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Valmont Industries, Inc. Quote\n\nSegment Review\n\nThe infrastructure segment\u2019s second-quarter revenues decreased 1% year over year to $760.4 million. It missed our estimate of $800.4 million. The Transmission, Distribution and Substation (Utility) product line saw slightly higher volumes. This quarter's sales growth was restrained by an increased mix of distribution and substation structures, as well as an unfavorable contractual pricing impact from steel index deflation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTelecommunications volumes were significantly lower than the previous year due to softer market conditions. Solar volumes also declined due to project schedule. Pricing was beneficial for the segment, with steel index deflation offset by a favorable mix.\r\n\r\nAgriculture segment revenues totaled $279.3 million, up 0.4% year over year. It beat our estimate of $249.3 million. Irrigation equipment volumes in North America jumped considerably, owing to a large increase in replacement sales caused by severe weather in the midwestern and southern United States. \r\n\r\nAverage irrigation selling prices were lower than the previous year owing to focused regional pricing initiatives. International revenues fell from last year. Sales in Brazil were notably down due to stabilizing backlog levels and decreased grain prices, which influenced growers' purchasing behavior. These reduced sales were somewhat offset by increased Middle Eastern project sales and the contribution from the HR Products purchase.\n\nFinancials\n\nVMI ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $163.1 million, down 2.4% year over year. Long-term debt was $1,017.5 million, up 6.8% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company returned $27.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and lowered borrowings on the revolving credit facility by around $90 million.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, Valmont now anticipates net sales to decline 1.5-3.5%. It has raised its EPS guidance to $16.50-$17.30. Infrastructure net sales growth is projected to be flat to 1.5%. The effective tax rate is expected to be roughly 26%. Foreign currency translation is predicted to have a minimal impact on net sales. Capital expenditures are now estimated to range between $95 million and $110 million to support strategic growth plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nVMI shares have lost 3.9% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 8.5% over the same period.

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Gold Stocks to Hedge Against Inflation: July 2024",
        "content": "Gold stocks are the ultimate hedge against inflation. While the recent rally has put the top names in the spotlight, plenty of stocks flying under the radar show massive potential.\n\nBefore diving into the gold stocks to invest in, let\u2019s understand why gold serves as a good hedge against inflation. As one of the oldest investment classes in history, gold offers a store of value that remains unmatched. It has tangible, real-world use cases and unlike fiat currencies, it is limited in supply and retains its value. Moreover, gold prices do not correlate with the market, making it a great diversification tool.\n\nWhile gold has always remained a solid investment choice, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year for the yellow metal. Gold prices hit a record high on July 17th as news of an anticipated interest cut and a weak dollar boosted demand. The momentum is set to continue, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) predicting gold prices could reach $3,000 in the next year. The current spot price for gold is over $2,400.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvesting in physical gold can be expensive and cumbersome, making gold stocks an attractive alternative for exposure to the asset. Amid the recent price rally, several top gold stocks have experienced significant gains this year. However, several lesser-known names show promise of substantial returns.\n\nKinross Gold Corp (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on the list is Kinross Gold Corp (NYSE:KGC). The company is involved in the exploration and extraction of gold and silver ore. It maintains a wide portfolio of operations with mines across the U.S., Canada, Chile, Brazil and Mauritania.\n\nKinross boasts impressive mining numbers. In 2023, the company produced 2.1 million ounces of gold, with its mines in the Americas accounting for 71% of total production. Coming into 2024, Kinross produced 527,000 tonnes in the first quarter and is on track to meet its 2.1 million target this year.\n\nIn addition to strong production numbers, Kinross gives investors plenty of reasons to remain optimistic about its growth. In the last earnings report, the company reported profit margins at $1,088 per ounce with $2 billion in liquidity. KGC is also a dividend-paying stock with an annual yield of 1.33%. Its healthy cash position hints at robust dividend growth.\n\nDespite a 79% price gain in the last 12 months, KGC stock appears to be attractively valued at a forward P/E of 15.6. Coupled with its strong financials and massive growth potential, this is one of the top under-the-radar gold stocks to hedge inflationary risks.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoeur Mining (CDE)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNext up is Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE), a producer of precious metals with operations across several regions, including Mexico, Nevada, South Dakota, Alaska and an exploration site in British Columbia. It has been a strong year for CDE stock, with shares up 101% this year. Much of this growth was driven by China.\n\nCoeur Mining\u2019s production numbers are just as impressive as its share price. Earlier this month, the company announced that its newly expanded mine in Rochester achieved its mid-year target run rates. At full capacity, the production levels at this mine will be 2.5 times higher than historic levels. That amounts to 32 million tons per year.\n\nAccording to Coeur\u2019s CEO, the increased production levels will increase cash injection and lower debt levels. This makes the stock an ideal hedge against inflation. Looking at the bigger picture, CDE expects total gold production rates for the year to exceed 2023 levels. The company projects production rates between 310,000 to 355,000 ounces.\n\nWith strong production rates and an expanding business, CDE is an underdog play with plenty of potential. The company also recorded a 76% increase in EBITDA from the prior year, making this one of the best gold stocks to hedge against inflation.\n\nDRDGOLD Limited (DRD) The logo for DRDGOLD Ltd (DRD).\n\nDRDGOLD Limited (NYSE:DRD) is an under-the-radar small-cap stock that pays a strong dividend and shows plenty of growth potential. Unlike traditional gold mining companies, South Africa-based DRDGOLD is responsible for the extracting, processing and smelting of gold. It recovers gold from the surface tailings at the Witwatersrand basin in Gauteng.\n\nDRDGOLD\u2019s financials are not too shabby. For the six months ended on December 31st, 2023, the company reported a revenue increase of 12% to R2 974.2 million and an operating profit rise of 15% to R909.3 million. The rally in gold prices drove these gains.\n\nThis year, DRD is in major expansion mode and has invested in Phase II of Far West Gold Recoveries, which will double plant capacity. While the capital investments will eat into costs, the company still expects to meet its production output for the year. DRDGOLD\u2019s upcoming projects hint at massive growth in the long haul.\n\nFor income-focused investors, DRD stock has also been paying dividends for 17 consecutive years, currently at a 4.6% annual yield. The company\u2019s strong performance and optimistic outlook make it one of the top gold stocks to hedge inflation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. CLF stated that it will establish a new electrical distribution transformer production plant in Weirton, WV. This strategic investment aims to alleviate the significant shortage of distribution transformers that is currently hindering economic growth across the United States.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs will repurpose its Half Moon Warehouse in Weirton to produce three-phase distribution transformers, which are used in electric power distribution systems. The total capital investment for this project is $150 million, with $50 million to be provided by the state of West Virginia through a forgivable loan. The plant is expected to begin operations in the first half of 2026. The U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s recent efficiency standards for distribution transformers support the long-term viability of this investment by promoting the use of highly efficient American-made Grain Oriented Electrical Steel (GOES).\n\nThis investment will create reemployment opportunities for 600 USW-represented workers from the idled Weirton tinplate mill. The new plant will increase demand for American-made GOES, which is produced exclusively by Cleveland-Cliffs in the United States at its Butler Works steel mill in Butler, PA. This is expected to lead to increased GOES production at Butler Works, offering potential employment growth for the UAW-represented workforce in Butler. The Weirton plant will also utilize stainless and carbon steel produced by Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 facilities in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc.

The company noted that the shortage of transformers, exacerbated by the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence across various sectors, will significantly increase electricity consumption. CLF's vision for Weirton is to develop a center of excellence for transformer manufacturing, providing well-paying, middle-class jobs to skilled workers and supporting the country\u2019s electrical infrastructure needs.\n\nThe company also highlighted Weirton's growth potential, citing its existing infrastructure and highly trained workforce. Cleveland-Cliffs expressed gratitude to the governor justice for advancing this critical project and to the West Virginia Department of Economic Development for the $50 million forgivable loan. The company also acknowledged the support from the Weirton community and regional officials.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited Steelworkers praised the investment, stating that it would provide significant employment opportunities for skilled Steelworkers. It emphasized that the new plant will build on Weirton\u2019s proud steelmaking legacy and establish the region as a manufacturing hub for transformers critical to U.S. economic and national security.\n\nShares of CLF are down 9.7% in the past year compared with a 7.9% fall in its\u00a0industry.

        "title": "Kinross Gold (KGC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects Kinross Gold (KGC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis gold mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $1.02 billion, down 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kinross Gold?\n\nFor Kinross Gold, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +12.78%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Kinross Gold will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Kinross Gold would post earnings of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.10, delivering a surprise of +66.67%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nKinross Gold appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Agnico Eagle Mines, Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold, Royal Gold and IAMGOLD",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 24, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, Barrick Gold GOLD, Kinross Gold KGC, Royal Gold RGLD and IAMGOLD IAG.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Gold Stocks Set to Outshine Earnings Estimates\n\nGold kicked off the second quarter at around $2,249 an ounce and gained momentum, staying consistently above the $2,300 mark. On May 20, it reached its peak for the quarter at $2,464.50 an ounce. The metal averaged $2,352.57 an ounce in the second quarter, marking an 18% increase from the prior-year quarter.\n\nGold has outperformed most major asset classes so far this year. Contributing factors include heightened geopolitical tensions, a weaker U.S. dollar, Asia investment flows, strong consumer demand, increasing speculation for monetary policy easing and ongoing central bank purchases.\n\nHigher gold prices are expected to have supported the earnings performances of gold mining companies in the April-June quarter. We have handpicked a few gold companies \u2014 Agnico Eagle Mines, Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold, Royal Gold and IAMGOLD \u2014 which are expected to beat estimates this earnings season. These companies also have a solid record of earnings surprises.\n\nDemand & Gold Prices to Have Aided Q2 Performance\n\nCentral banks, particularly China, have been ramping up reserves held in gold due to currency depreciation, and geopolitical and economic risks. Central banks' net demand totaled 290 tons in the first quarter, with China, Turkey and India leading the way. It was the strongest start to any year on record. According to 70 responses to the 2024 Central Bank Gold Reserves survey, 29% of central banks plan to increase their gold reserves in the next 12 months. This is the highest projection since the initiation of the survey in 2018. This suggests that central banks' gold purchases have been strong throughout the second quarter as well.\n\nGlobal gold ETFs have now seen inflows of $0.2 billion in the second quarter. This was, however, at a much-reduced pace than the outflow of $6.5 billion seen in the first quarter of 2024. In the second quarter, outflows from North America ($0.6 billion) and Europe (around $2 billion) were offset by solid inflows in Asia ($2.4 billion). This was mainly driven by China, as the weakness in stocks and the property sector, and continued depreciation in the RMB boosted investor demand for gold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology has been strong. India and China account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. Despite higher prices, economic strength in India is yielding wealth-driven buying. Physical demand has also been strong in China of late.\n\nCompanies in the industry have been ramping up production to capitalize on the favorable trends. Increased output, combined with higher gold prices, is expected to have boosted the performances of the gold miners. However, elevated input costs, particularly labor, fuel and electricity, are expected to have dented margins. Gold miners have proactively been focusing on improving operating efficiency and cutting down costs, which are likely to have helped them maintain margins despite the inflationary scenario.\n\nPer the Zacks classification, the Mining - Gold industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector. The latest Earnings Trends report projects a 20% year-over-year plunge in earnings for the sector, whereas revenues are anticipated to be down 4.3%. These are likely to have been led by overall lower commodity prices, dragged down by weak demand in China. Gold miners are, however, expected to deviate from this trend, considering that gold has outperformed other assets so far this year.\n\nHow to Pick Winners?\n\nGiven the wide range of companies in the gold mining space, identifying stocks that are poised to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases might seem a daunting task. However, our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple. We are picking stocks, which have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of an earnings surprise is as much as 70%.\n\nEarnings ESP \u2014 the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate \u2014 is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their next announcements. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n5 Potential Outperformers This Earnings Season\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines has an Earnings ESP of +4.39% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 16.5%, on average.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAEM's expected upbeat quarterly production, along with higher gold prices, is likely to get reflected in its second-quarter top-line results. However, higher operating costs at most mine sites resulting from inflation, and increased royalties arising from improved gold prices and gold production will likely offset some of the gains. The company's efforts to manage costs and drive operating efficiency are anticipated to have benefited earnings in the quarter to be reported.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEM's second-quarter earnings is pegged at 86 cents, indicating an improvement of 32% from the year-ago quarter's actual. The estimate has moved up 6% over the past 60 days.\n\nBarrick Gold currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.29% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 12. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.3%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nThe company recently reported preliminary second-quarter sales of 956 thousand ounces of gold and 42 thousand tons of copper. Even though it met company expectations, the figures were lower on a year-over-year basis. Nevertheless, higher prices for gold and copper are likely to have negated this impact. The cost of sales is expected to have been higher in the second quarter due to lower production and sales volumes, along with unplanned costs and changes in the sales mix across different mine sites, as well as higher royalties.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOLD's second-quarter earnings has moved down 3.7% over the past 60 days and is pegged at 26 cents. The same indicates an improvement of 37% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nKinross Gold has an Earnings ESP of +14.66% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 46%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nKGC's results are likely to reflect improved production and higher prices. However, the company's production costs are expected to have been high, mainly reflecting changes in the production mix, with higher production expected from the company's U.S. assets and a reduction in production at Paracatu, along with inflationary pressures.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KGC's second-quarter earnings has moved 30% north in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate is pegged at 13 cents, indicating a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter's actual.\n\nRoyal Gold currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.99% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 7. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.88%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nRoyal Gold recently issued a stream segment sales update for second-quarter 2024. The company sold 52,600 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs), comprising 39,200 ounces of gold, 593,200 ounces of silver and 1,500 tons of copper related to its streaming agreements. GEOs sold declined 2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile gold and silver sales were down 3% and 26% year over year, respectively, copper sales increased 88%. However, average realized prices for gold, silver and copper were reported to be up 18%, 19% and 9%, respectively, in the quarter. Thus, the impacts of lower sales on RGLD's revenues are likely to have been negated by higher prices. The cost of sales was approximately $459 per GEO, higher than the $436 reported in the prior-year quarter, which is likely to have dented the company's earnings performance in the quarter under review.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RGLD's second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.17, indicating an improvement of 33% from the year-ago quarter's actual. Earnings estimates have moved up 2.6% in the past 60 days.\n\nIAMGOLD has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 at present. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 8. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 187.5%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nUpbeat production from Essakane and Westwood, and full quarter contribution from Cote Gold, along with higher gold prices, are anticipated to have boosted IAG's second-quarter revenues. However, inflated costs due to higher production levels and elevated input costs are likely to have hurt margins.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IAG's second-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 14.3% over the past 60 days and is pegged at 8 cents. The estimate indicates a significant turnaround from the loss of 1 cent reported in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Eastman Chemical (EMN) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Eastman Chemical Company EMN is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results after the closing bell on Jul 25.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 5% on average. EMN pulled off an earnings surprise of 14.2% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nEastman is expected to have benefited from cost-cutting and productivity initiatives, as well as its innovation-driven growth strategy. However, soft demand in certain markets is likely to have weighed on its second-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nThe stock has gained 12.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s fall of 10%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for EMN this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Eastman Chemical is +0.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at $1.99. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Eastman Chemical currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWhat Do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,369.3 million, which implies a rise of around 1.9% from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for EMN\u2019s Additives and Functional Products division\u2019s revenues is pegged at $715.3 million, suggesting a fall of 4.3% year over year. The same for the Advanced Materials unit\u2019s revenues is $733.8 million, indicating a decline of 0.7%.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for the Chemical Intermediates segment\u2019s revenues is pinned at $515.5 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 0.3%. The same for the Fiber segment stands at $371.5 million, indicating an increase of 15% year over year.\n\nSome Factors to Watch\n\nEastman's cost-cutting initiatives are anticipated to have benefited the company in the June quarter. It is expected to have gained from its operational transformation efforts, which are likely to have resulted in lower operating costs.\r\n\r\nEMN is taking action to keep its manufacturing and administrative costs in control. It achieved cost savings of around $200 million in 2023, net of inflation.\u00a0 The company also plans to maintain pricing discipline and improve asset utilization throughout this year. Pricing initiatives and lower raw material and energy costs are also expected to have supported its bottom line.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Eastman's goal is to increase new business revenues by utilizing its innovation-driven growth strategy. Its sales volumes are likely to have been aided by innovation and market development initiatives.\r\n\r\nHowever, EMN is exposed to headwinds from weak demand and continued de-stocking in specific markets. Lingering effects from customer inventory de-stocking across certain markets are expected to have impacted its performance. The company, on its first-quarter call, said that it sees uncertain primary demand in key markets and regions through the remainder of 2024. It expects continued de-stocking in medical and agriculture in the second quarter. EMN also sees soft demand in building & construction in most regions and cautious customer behavior in consumer durables and electronics.\n\nStory continues\n\nEastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nEastman Chemical Company price-eps-surprise | Eastman Chemical Company Quote\n\nStocks That Warrant a Look\n\nHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:\r\n\r\nAgnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, scheduled to release earnings on Jul 31, has an Earnings ESP of +6.31% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

        "title": "5 Gold Stocks Set to Outshine Earnings Estimates in Q2",
        "content": "Gold kicked off the second quarter at around $2,249 an ounce and gained momentum, staying consistently above the $2,300 mark. On May 20, it reached its peak for the quarter at $2,464.50 an ounce. The metal averaged $2,352.57 an ounce in the second quarter, marking an 18% increase from the prior-year quarter. Gold has outperformed most major asset classes so far this year. Contributing factors include heightened geopolitical tensions, a weaker U.S. dollar, Asia investment flows, strong consumer demand, increasing speculation for monetary policy easing and ongoing central bank purchases.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHigher gold prices are expected to have supported the earnings performances of gold mining companies in the April-June quarter. We have handpicked a few gold companies \u2014 Agnico Eagle Mines AEM, Barrick Gold GOLD, Kinross Gold KGC, Royal Gold RGLD and IAMGOLD IAG \u2014 which are expected to beat estimates this earnings season. These companies also have a solid record of earnings surprises.\n\nDemand & Gold Prices to Have Aided Q2 Performance\n\nCentral banks, particularly China, have been ramping up reserves held in gold due to currency depreciation, and geopolitical and economic risks. Central banks\u2019 net demand totaled 290 tons in the first quarter, with China, Turkey and India leading the way. It was the strongest start to any year on record. According to 70 responses to the 2024 Central Bank Gold Reserves survey, 29% of central banks plan to increase their gold reserves in the next 12 months. This is the highest projection since the initiation of the survey in 2018. This suggests that central banks\u2019 gold purchases have been strong throughout the second quarter as well.\r\n\r\nGlobal gold ETFs have now seen inflows of $0.2 billion in the second quarter. This was, however, at a much-reduced pace than the outflow of $6.5 billion seen in the first quarter of 2024. In the second quarter, outflows from North America ($0.6 billion) and Europe (around $2 billion) were offset by solid inflows in Asia ($2.4 billion). This was mainly driven by China, as the weakness in stocks and the property sector, and continued depreciation in the RMB boosted investor demand for gold. \r\n\r\nThe use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology has been strong. India and China account for around 50% of consumer gold demand. Despite higher prices, economic strength in India is yielding wealth-driven buying. Physical demand has also been strong in China of late.\r\n\r\nCompanies in the industry have been ramping up production to capitalize on the favorable trends. Increased output, combined with higher gold prices, is expected to have boosted the performances of the gold miners. However, elevated input costs, particularly labor, fuel and electricity, are expected to have dented margins. Gold miners have proactively been focusing on improving operating efficiency and cutting down costs, which are likely to have helped them maintain margins despite the inflationary scenario.\r\n\r\nPer the Zacks classification, the Mining - Gold industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector. The latest Earnings Trends report projects a 20% year-over-year plunge in earnings for the sector, whereas revenues are anticipated to be down 4.3%. These are likely to have been led by overall lower commodity prices, dragged down by weak demand in China. Gold miners are, however, expected to deviate from this trend, considering that gold has outperformed other assets so far this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Pick Winners?\n\nGiven the wide range of companies in the gold mining space, identifying stocks that are poised to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases might seem a daunting task. However, our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple. We are picking stocks, which have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nOur research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of an earnings surprise is as much as 70%.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP \u2014 the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate \u2014 is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their next announcements. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n5 Potential Outperformers This Earnings Season\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines has an Earnings ESP of +4.39% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 16.5%, on average.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines Limited Price and EPS Surprise Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines Limited price-eps-surprise | Agnico Eagle Mines Limited Quote\n\nAEM\u2019s expected upbeat quarterly production, along with higher gold prices, is likely to get reflected in its second-quarter top-line results. However, higher operating costs at most mine sites resulting from inflation, and increased royalties arising from improved gold prices and gold production will likely offset some of the gains. The company\u2019s efforts to manage costs and drive operating efficiency are anticipated to have benefited earnings in the quarter to be reported.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEM\u2019s second-quarter earnings is pegged at 86 cents, indicating an improvement of 32% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual. The estimate has moved up 6% over the past 60 days. \r\n\r\nBarrick Gold currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.29% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 12. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.3%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nBarrick Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Barrick Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nBarrick Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Barrick Gold Corporation Quote\n\nThe company recently reported preliminary second-quarter sales of 956 thousand ounces of gold and 42 thousand tons of copper. Even though it met company expectations, the figures were lower on a year-over-year basis. Nevertheless, higher prices for gold and copper are likely to have negated this impact. The cost of sales is expected to have been higher in the second quarter due to lower production and sales volumes, along with unplanned costs and changes in the sales mix across different mine sites, as well as higher royalties.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOLD\u2019s second-quarter earnings has moved down 3.7% over the past 60 days and is pegged at 26 cents. The same indicates an improvement of 37% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. \r\n\r\nKinross Gold has an Earnings ESP of +14.66% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 31. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 46%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kinross Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nKinross Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Kinross Gold Corporation Quote\n\nKGC\u2019s results are likely to reflect improved production and higher prices. However, the company's production costs are expected to have been high, mainly reflecting changes in the production mix, with higher production expected from the company's U.S. assets and a reduction in production at Paracatu, along with inflationary pressures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KGC\u2019s second-quarter earnings has moved 30% north in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate is pegged at 13 cents, indicating a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual. \r\n\r\nRoyal Gold currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.99% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 7. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.88%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nRoyal Gold, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Royal Gold, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nRoyal Gold, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Royal Gold, Inc. Quote\n\nRoyal Gold recently issued a stream segment sales update for second-quarter 2024. The company sold 52,600 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs), comprising 39,200 ounces of gold, 593,200 ounces of silver and 1,500 tons of copper related to its streaming agreements. GEOs sold declined 2% from the year-ago quarter. While gold and silver sales were down 3% and 26% year over year, respectively, copper sales increased 88%. However, average realized prices for gold, silver and copper were reported to be up 18%, 19% and 9%, respectively, in the quarter. Thus, the impacts of lower sales on RGLD\u2019s revenues are likely to have been negated by higher prices. The cost of sales was approximately $459 per GEO, higher than the $436 reported in the prior-year quarter, which is likely to have dented the company\u2019s earnings performance in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RGLD\u2019s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.17, indicating an improvement of 33% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual. Earnings estimates have moved up 2.6% in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nIAMGOLD has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 at present. It is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 8. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 187.5%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four quarters.\n\nIamgold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Iamgold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nIamgold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Iamgold Corporation Quote\n\nUpbeat production from Essakane and Westwood, and full quarter contribution from Cote Gold, along with higher gold prices, are anticipated to have boosted IAG\u2019s second-quarter revenues. However, inflated costs due to higher production levels and elevated input costs are likely to have hurt margins.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IAG\u2019s second-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 14.3% over the past 60 days and is pegged at 8 cents. The estimate indicates a significant turnaround from the loss of 1 cent reported in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy for Potential 50% Upside as Gold Trades Near $2,500 an Ounce",
        "content": "Gold has witnessed a healthy rally of 17% for year-to-date. After trading at recent highs of $2,482 an ounce, there has been some correction in the precious metal. However, I believe that gold is likely to remain in an uptrend. It\u2019s therefore a good time to consider exposure to gold stocks for robust returns.\n\nA key reason to be bullish on gold is the likelihood of multiple rate cuts in the next 18 months. Expansionary policies are negative for the dollar and positive for precious metals. Citi analysts see gold trading near $3,000 an ounce in the next 6 to 18 months.\n\nIf this scenario holds true, investors can expect some of the best gold stocks to go ballistic. With higher realized gold prices, free cash flows will swell for gold miners and translate into higher dividends coupled with increased financial flexibility.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s talk about three gold stocks to buy that can surge by 50% before the end of 2025.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Silver Stocks to Buy - Newmont Corp (NEM)\n\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock has trended higher by 14% for year-to-date. The gold miner however looks attractive at a forward P/E of 16.4 and offers a dividend yield of 2.13%. As gold trends higher, Newmont is positioned to deliver healthy growth coupled with robust free cash flows.\n\nAs an overview, Newmont has 128 million ounces in gold reserves and 155 million ounces of resources. With a leading portfolio of tier one assets globally, the miner is positioned to deliver steady production growth beyond the decade.\n\nLast year, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.8 billion. With gold trending higher, it\u2019s likely that OCF will be more than $4 billion for 2024. Further, if Citi\u2019s estimates of gold at $3,000 an ounce hold true, annual OCF can be more than $5 billion. This will position Newmont for healthy dividend growth coupled with flexibility for aggressive capital investments. With NEM stock due for re-rating, the upside potential is significant from current levels.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock has been an underperformer with year-to-date returns of 2%. I however believe that a breakout on the upside is impending with the gold miner delivering strong numbers. Besides the potential for capital gains, GOLD stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.18%.\n\nBarrick recently reported preliminary Q2 production of 948,000 ounces of gold and 43,000 tonnes of copper. The company is on track to progressively increase gold and copper production each quarter and is on-track to meet the full year guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, Barrick expects steady increase in gold production between 2024 and 2027. Further, copper production is expected to double by 2029. If this is associated with higher realized prices, Barrick is positioned for healthy revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow upside.\n\nAnother point to note is that Barrick expects continued decline in all-in-sustaining-cost (AISC) between 2024 and 2026. This is another reason to expect EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside. With Barrick already having an investment grade balance sheet, there is ample flexibility for dividend growth and value creation through share repurchase.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) stock has surged by 45% for year-to-date. I however remain bullish on the stock with valuations remaining attractive. Further, KGC stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 15.4.\n\nOne concern for Kinross is the point that the company expects stable gold production in the next 24 to 36 months. However, this is likely to be offset by the fact that higher realized gold prices will translate into revenue and cash flow growth.\n\nThe positive point to note is that Kinross has an investment grade balance sheet. The miner ended Q1 2024 with a liquidity buffer of $2 billion. Additionally, If gold trades in the range of $2,500 to $3,000 an ounce, Kinross is likely to report operating cash flow of more than $2 billion. \u00a0 With high financial flexibility, Kinross is likely to pursue acquisition of assets to boost production growth. That\u2019s one factor that\u2019s likely to translate into stock re-rating. I also expect healthy dividend growth over the next 24 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Sherwin-Williams Company SHW logged second-quarter 2024 earnings (as reported) of $3.50 per share, up around 14% from $3.07 in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nBarring one-time items, adjusted earnings were $3.70 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.51.\r\n\r\nSherwin-Williams posted revenues of $6,271.5 million, up around 0.5% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,350.1 million. Consolidated net sales rose mainly owing to increased sales volumes in the Paint Stores and Performance Coatings Groups, which were partly offset by reduced sales volumes in the Consumer Brands Group, taking into account the impact of the China architectural business divestment in 2023.\n\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Sherwin-Williams Company Quote\n\nSegmental Review\n\nThe Paint Stores Group segment registered net sales of $3,619.9 million in the second quarter, up around 3.5% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,635.9 million. Net sales in the segment increased primarily as a result of low-single-digit sales volume growth and the sustained realization of higher selling prices. Net sales increased in all end markets, led by residential repaint, new residential, commercial, protective and marine, with the exception of property maintenance, which fell slightly year over year.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNet sales in the Consumer Brands Group segment declined 10.7% year over year to $844.3 million, missing the consensus estimate of $923.4 million. Net sales of the segment dropped primarily due to a mid-single-digit percentage sales volume decline as a result of weak DIY demand in North America, a 2% impact from the divestiture of the China architectural business in 2023 and a 2% impact from unfavorable currency translation.\r\n\r\nNet sales in the Performance Coatings Group rose roughly 0.6% year over year to around $1,806.4 million in the reported quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $1,793.6 million. Performance Coating\u2019s net sales increased primarily due to 1.7% incremental sales from an acquisition, which were slightly offset by a 1% negative currency translation. Sales volumes were varied by region and business. Industrial Wood, Coil and Automotive Refinish in North America aided the performance, which was partly offset by a fall in General Industrial across all regions.\n\nFinancials\n\nDuring the first six months of 2024, the company generated $1.14 billion in net operating cash and returned $1.34 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and 3.1 million shares of common stock repurchases. As of Jun 30, 2024, SHW had remaining authorization to purchase 36.5 million shares of its common stock in open market transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nSHW raised its adjusted earnings guidance for 2024. The company expects consolidated net sales to be up a low-single-digit percentage year over year for the third quarter. For 2024, it is projected to be up a low-single-digit percentage.\r\n\r\nThe company expects earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $10.3-$10.6.\u00a0 Adjusted earnings are now projected to be $11.10-$11.40 per share for the year. The company expects the effective tax rate to be low 20%.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Sherwin-Williams have gained 20.3% in the past year compared with a 20.1% rise of the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nSHW currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, Ero Copper Corp.

        "title": "Dow (DOW) Gears Up for Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Dow Inc. DOW is scheduled to come up with second-quarter 2024 results before the opening bell on Jul 25.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters at an average of around 11.4%. It posted an earnings surprise of roughly 19.2% in the last reported quarter.\r\n\r\nWhile DOW is expected to have benefited from its cost and productivity initiatives, soft demand due to weak global economic activities and plant turnaround costs are likely to have affected its second-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nDow\u2019s shares are up 3.6% over a year compared with a 9.4% decline recorded by the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Dow for the second quarter is currently pegged at $11,000.6 million, suggesting a decline of around 3.7% year over year.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for revenues for the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment is currently pegged at $5,592.8 million, calling for a decline of 5.8% year over year. The same for the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment stands at $3,065.8 million, indicating a roughly 3.5% year-over-year decline.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for revenues for the Performance Materials & Coatings segment is pinned at $2,240.9 million, suggesting a rise of around 2% year over year.\n\nSome Factors at Play\n\nDow is expected to have faced headwinds from demand softness in Europe and Asia Pacific in the quarter to be reported. Lower consumer spending amid inflationary pressures is impacting demand in Europe. Global industrial activities have been affected by the weaker demand recovery in China. The property sector remains sluggish in China with declining new home prices.\u00a0\r\n\r\nInflationary pressures are impacting consumer durables and building and construction demand. Demand in infrastructure including residential construction remains weak. Soft conditions across these markets are likely to have impacted volumes in the second quarter. \r\n\r\nThe company is also likely to have faced headwinds from plant turnaround costs in the second quarter. It expects a roughly $25 million headwind from higher planned turnarounds in the quarter in Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast to impact the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure unit. Also, a roughly $75 million headwind is expected in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics unit due to higher planned maintenance activities including a cracker turnaround in Sabine, TX. Costs related to turnarounds are expected to have weighed on Dow\u2019s margins in the June quarter.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Dow is expected to have benefited from cost-saving and productivity actions in the second quarter. It remains focused on maintaining cost and operational discipline. DOW is implementing targeted actions focused on optimizing labor and purchased service costs, lowering turnaround spending and boosting productivity. Its targeted actions delivered $1 billion in cost savings for full-year 2023. Benefits of DOW\u2019s restructuring programs are likely to be reflected on its bottom line in the June quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nDow Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dow Inc.

        "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Mining - Gold sector might want to consider either Kinross Gold (KGC) or Alamos Gold (AGI). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nKinross Gold has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Alamos Gold has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that KGC's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nKGC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.81, while AGI has a forward P/E of 23.73. We also note that KGC has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AGI currently has a PEG ratio of 0.77.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for KGC is its P/B ratio of 1.73. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AGI has a P/B of 2.29.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to KGC's Value grade of A and AGI's Value grade of C.\n\nKGC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that KGC is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Zacks.com featured highlights include General Motors, EnerSys, Ford Motor and Kinross Gold",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are General Motors Co. GM, EnerSys ENS, Ford Motor Co. F and Kinross Gold Corp. KGC.\n\nPick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio\n\nThe U.S. market experienced a decline on Jul 18 as investors shifted away from technology stocks and took profits from recent gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, the S&P 500 decreased 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%. This broad sell-off in technology stocks occurred against a backdrop of growing optimism for a potential rate cut in September.\n\nInvestor caution is growing due to concerns about potential trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions, particularly impacting chip stocks. This shift in the market reflects a broader trend of repositioning as the earnings season unfolds. In this environment, value stocks may present a safer and more stable investment option.\n\nValue investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\n\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Co., EnerSys, Ford Motor Co. and Kinross Gold Corp. boast a low P/CF ratio.\n\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\n\nAnalysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\n\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\n\nHere are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.8%, on average. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 2.6% and 22.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period. General Motors has a Value Score of A. Shares of GM have risen 26.5% in the past year.\n\nEnerSys, the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.7%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EnerSys' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 3.7% and 4.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period. ENS has a Value Score of A. Shares of ENS have lost 4.3% in the past year.\n\nFord Motor, which designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles and Lincoln luxury vehicles globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.3%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford Motor's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Ford Motor has a Value Score of A. The stock has increased 3.7% in the past year.\n\nKinross Gold, a Canada-based gold mining company with operations and projects in the United States, Brazil, Mauritania, Chile and Canada, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 46%, on average.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kinross Gold's current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 8.1% and 27.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

        "content": "It\u2019s a myth that low-priced stocks have weak fundamentals or are speculative. While there can be purely speculative ideas among low-priced stocks, there are also some high-quality bets. This column focuses on dividend stocks under $10 that are fundamentally strong and look undervalued.\n\nIn my view, these dividend stocks are poised for 100% returns within the next 24 months. Additionally, I expect steady dividend growth as revenue and EBITDA increases in the coming years.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning here that the S&P 500 index is trading near all-time highs. However, if we look at the broader markets, ideas are trading at attractive valuations. With rate cuts impending, easy money will flow into value stocks. This is likely to support the bull run in the dividend stocks discussed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBesides the liquidity and market momentum factor, let\u2019s talk about the fundamental reasons to be bullish on these dividend stocks under $10.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) stock has rallied by 72% in the last 12 months. However, at a forward P/E of 15.7, the 1.33% dividend yield stock remains attractive. In my view, 100% returns are likely from current levels within the next 24 months.\n\nThe first catalyst for Kinross is a higher gold price. The precious metal has surged for year-to-date and trades at $2,430 an ounce. Citigroup believes that gold is likely to touch $3,000 an ounce in the next 6 to 18 months. A key reason for this view is expansionary monetary policies.\n\nSpecific to Kinross, higher realized gold price in the coming quarters is likely to translate into revenue growth, EBITDA margin expansion, and cash flow upside. Further, as free cash flows swell, there is a strong case for robust growth in dividends.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Kinross already has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of Q1 2024, the gold miner reported a liquidity buffer of $2 billion. Also, if gold trades anywhere near $3,000 an ounce, the annual operating cash flow visibility will be more than $2.5 billion. High financial flexibility will also provide flexibility for potential acquisitions.\n\nBorr Drilling (BORR) Offshore oil rig near Harlingen, Nederlande. Oil producing is a major economic factor in the Netherlands.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) is another attractive stock under $10 that\u2019s poised for a big rally. The offshore drilling services provider looks attractively valued at a forward P/E of 12.5. Further, after the recent 100% increase in quarterly dividends, BORR stock has a yield of 5.8%.\n\nFrom a revenue visibility perspective, it\u2019s important to note that Borr has a contract coverage of 93% for 2024. Further, the contract coverage for the next year is 71%. In Q1 2024, Borr reported an order intake of $318 million. As oil trends higher, I expect the order inflow to remain strong coupled with an increase in day rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Borr Drilling reported an adjusted EBITDA of $351 million. The company has guided for an adjusted EBITDA of $525 million for 2024. Healthy EBITDA growth will likely sustain next year coupled with margin expansion. Further, as cash flows swell, credit metrics are likely to improve. With these positives, BORR stock looks attractively valued.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFF) Energy Storage. battery stocks\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFF) is an undervalued EV battery stock to buy. Currently, PCRFF stock trades at a forward P/E of 6.6 and offers a dividend yield of 2.8%. Sentiments have been bearish for the EV industry. Once that changes, I expect PCRFF stock to surge higher.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Panasonic has ambitious growth plans. The company is targeting to quadruple EV battery capacity to 200GWh by 2031. Of course, the slowdown in the industry implies that capital investments will be scaled back in the near term. However, the long-term outlook remains positive for the industry.\n\nWith stiff competition in the industry, innovation is the key to survival and growth. I am positive on that front with Panasonic investing in boosting battery density and efficiency.\n\nIn December 2023, the company partnered with Sila Nanotechnology to \u201cpurchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.\u201d This will help Panasonic in achieving the target of a 25% increase in battery energy density.\n\nOverall, Panasonic is positioned for steady growth and EBITDA upside considering the expansion plans. The bearish sentiments are therefore a good accumulation opportunity and make Panasonic among the best dividend stocks under $10.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Kinross Gold (KGC) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.14 a share nine days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 31, 2024.\n\nKGC has an Earnings ESP figure of 14.66%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.14 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13.\n\nKGC is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Hecla Mining (HL).\n\nHecla Mining is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 13, 2024. HL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.02 a share 22 days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hecla Mining is $0.01, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 50%.\n\nKGC and HL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio",
        "content": "The U.S. market experienced a decline on Jul 18 as investors shifted away from technology stocks and took profits from recent gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, the S&P 500 decreased 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7%. This broad sell-off in technology stocks occurred against a backdrop of growing optimism for a potential rate cut in September.\r\n\r\nInvestor caution is growing due to concerns about potential trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions, particularly impacting chip stocks. This shift in the market reflects a broader trend of repositioning as the earnings season unfolds. In this environment, value stocks may present a safer and more stable investment option.\r\n\r\nValue investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.\r\n\r\nThere are different valuation metrics to determine a stock\u2019s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company\u2019s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Company GM, EnerSys ENS, Ford Motor Company F and Kinross Gold Corporation KGC boast a low P/CF ratio.\r\n\r\nThis metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis \u2014 the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.\r\n\r\nAnalysts caution that a company\u2019s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.\r\n\r\nPositive cash flow indicates an increase in a company\u2019s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company\u2019s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.\r\n\r\nHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bargain Hunting Strategy\n\nHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:\u00a0\r\n\r\nP/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nP/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.\r\n\r\nP/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.\r\n\r\nP/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.\r\n\r\nPEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nGeneral Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.8%, on average.

General Motors has a Value Score of A. Shares of GM have risen 26.5% in the past year.\r\n\r\nEnerSys, the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.7%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EnerSys\u2019 current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 3.7% and 4.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period. ENS has a Value Score of A. Shares of ENS have lost 4.3% in the past year.\r\n\r\nFord Motor, which designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles and Lincoln luxury vehicles globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.3%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford Motor\u2019s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

        "title": "Kronos (KRO) Expands North American Base With LPC Acquisition",
        "content": "Kronos Worldwide, Inc. KRO recently announced that it acquired a 50% joint venture interest in Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. (\u201cLPC\u201d). It was previously held by Venator Investments, Ltd. Kronos, through a wholly-owned subsidiary that already had a 50% interest in LPC. With this acquisition, LPC is now an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Kronos. The transaction involved an upfront cash payment of $185 million (subject to working capital adjustments) and a potential earn-out payment of up to $15 million based on KRO\u2019s aggregate consolidated EBITDA for calendar years 2025 and 2026.\n\nThis acquisition is a unique opportunity for Kronos to enhance customer value and better serve the North American market. By fully owning the LPC facility, Kronos will broaden its product offerings and boost sales to new and existing customers. Kronos expects to realize significant synergies, including commercial, overhead and supply chain optimization. It will also implement process innovations to increase capacity and improve efficiency, leveraging proven technology from other Kronos facilities. LPC, the newest chloride-process TiO2 production facility in the Western world, is now fully integrated into Kronos.\n\nKRO had operated LPC as a joint venture with Venator Materials or its predecessors since 1993. Located near Lake Charles, LA, LPC has an estimated annual production capacity of 156,000 metric tons. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand and borrowings under Kronos\u2019 global revolving credit facility. It will report LPC as a wholly-owned subsidiary starting with its third-quarter Form 10-Q filing. The company may also explore additional financing opportunities, subject to market conditions.\n\nKronos Worldwide Inc Price and Consensus Kronos Worldwide Inc Price and Consensus\n\nKronos Worldwide Inc price-consensus-chart | Kronos Worldwide Inc Quote\n\nTo support the acquisition and its general liquidity needs, Kronos amended its $225-million global revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo. The amendment raises the maximum borrowing amount to $300 million, extends the maturity date to 2029 and includes LPC and its receivables and certain inventories in the borrowing base.\n\nKronos\u2019 board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share, down 14 cents from second-quarter 2024 tally. The dividend is payable on Sep 19, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business as of Sep 6, 2024. The reduced dividend rate will help it maintain a strong balance sheet while pursuing strategic investment opportunities. This adjustment will also enhance its liquidity, providing flexibility to manage increased debt service costs, working capital needs and capital improvements from the LPC acquisition. KRO will continue to evaluate the dividend rate based on its progress, operational results and other relevant factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Kronos have gained 14.6% in the past year compared with a 7.3% fall in its\u00a0industry.

        "title": "Has Fortuna Mining Corp. (FSM) Outpaced Other Basic Materials Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "Investors interested in Basic Materials stocks should always be looking to find the best-performing companies in the group. Fortuna Silver Mines (FSM) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nFortuna Silver Mines is a member of the Basic Materials sector. This group includes 238 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #5. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups.

        "title": "Will Weaker Steel Prices Weigh on Nucor's (NUE) Earnings in Q2?",
        "content": "Nucor Corporation NUE is set to release second-quarter 2024 results after the closing bell on Jul 22.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. steel giant surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.6%, on average. It posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.4% in the last reported quarter. Lower earnings in the steel mills segment on weaker selling prices and volumes are likely to have hurt its second-quarter results.\r\n\r\nNucor\u2019s shares are down 4.8% year to date, compared with the industry\u2019s 13.8% decline. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nNucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the second quarter. It anticipates second-quarter earnings in the range of $2.20-$2.30 per share.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $7,645.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 19.7%.\n\nA Few Factors to Watch\n\nLower profitability in the steel mills segment is expected to have weighed on Nucor\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported. Nucor, in June, said that it expects reduced earnings in the steel mills segment sequentially, mainly due to lower average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for total sales tons to outside customers for steel mills is pegged at 4,641,000 tons for the second quarter, suggesting a decline from 4,676,000 tons reported in the prior quarter and a 2.8% year-over-year decrease.\r\n\r\nNUE also sees lower earnings in the steel products segment due to lower average selling prices, partly offset by increased volumes. However, earnings in the raw materials segment are projected to be higher compared with the first quarter, thanks to increased profitability at Nucor's direct reduced iron facilities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, U.S. steel prices have seen a significant downward correction this year after a strong run in late 2023 that extended into early 2024. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices retreated since early 2024, with prices plummeting to below $800 per short ton in March 2024 from $1,200 per short ton at the start of the year. A combination of factors led to the downswing, including a pullback in steel mill lead times, an oversupply of steel exacerbated by increased imports, reduced demand from key industries and global economic uncertainties. U.S. HRC prices continued their downward slide in the second quarter, being pressured by an influx of imports, currently hovering below the $700 per short ton level.\r\n\r\nLower average selling prices are likely to have hurt NUE\u2019s sales and margins in the quarter to be reported.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for second-quarter average sales price per ton for the company\u2019s steel mills unit stands at $958, suggesting an 18% year-over-year decrease and a 13.5% sequential decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nNucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NUE this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

        "content": "Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX is set to release second-quarter 2024 results before the opening bell on Jul 23.\r\n\r\nThe mining giant\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 23.5%, on average. While Freeport is expected to have gained from higher copper prices in the second quarter, increased costs and lower sales volumes are likely to have affected its results.\r\n\r\nThe stock has gained 9.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 25.9% rise. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for FCX this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Freeport is +2.21%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at 38 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Indicate?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport\u2019s second-quarter consolidated revenues is currently pegged at $5,997 million, which suggests a year-over-year increase of 4.5%.\n\nA Few Factors to Watch\n\nFreeport\u2019s second-quarter results are also expected to have been supported by the strength in copper prices. Copper prices have notched gains of roughly 10% so far this year, aided by supply concerns and signs of improving demand from top consumer China. A recovery in China\u2019s industrial sector has led to an uptick in copper demand. Prices of copper were up around 9.5% in the second quarter.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur estimate for second-quarter average realized price for copper currently stands at $4.25, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.7% and a sequential rise of 7.9%.\r\n\r\nHowever, lower copper and gold sales volumes are expected to have impacted the company\u2019s results. FCX, earlier this month, said that it expects to ship a portion of its second-quarter production in subsequent periods due to the delay in securing PT-FI's export license.\n\nThe company expects its consolidated sales for the second quarter to be roughly 5% lower than its April 2024 forecast of 975 million pounds of copper and around 30% lower than its prior view of 500,000 ounces of gold.\r\n\r\nMoreover, higher costs are likely to have weighed on Freeport\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported. The company now expects consolidated unit net cash costs for the second quarter to be about $1.77 per pound of copper, compared with its earlier expectation of $1.57 per pound. The expected increase is primarily due to decreased by-product credits as a result of shipment delays.\n\nStory continues\n\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

        "content": "You get what you pay for and that applies to the equities sector as well. Sure, you can always filter for ideas that are cheap in price. The problem with this approach is that, more often than not, you\u2019re also getting cheap businesses. What\u2019s worse, these entities can get even cheaper \u2013 that\u2019s not what you want as an investor. Fortunately, there are many compelling ideas among stocks to buy under $10.\n\nA key mathematical benefit to equities in this price class is the law of small numbers. When you\u2019re dealing with single digits, it\u2019s possible that modest news items can dramatically boost the underlying share price. Also, ideas in this category tend to be growth-driven plays that respond more aggressively to positive developments. Of course, the opposite is also true so you do need to be wary of unexpected headwinds.\n\nAnother factor that bolsters the case for stocks to buy under $10 is retail participation. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 it\u2019s much easier to convince regular folks to acquire shares that are $10 rather than $100. So, when positive news breaks, the intense rush into the company can potentially skyrocket its valuation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, below are three stocks to buy under $10.\n\nSimilarweb (SMWB) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA global software development and data aggregation company, Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB) specializes in various services. In particular, it focuses on web analytics, web traffic and digital performance. Since the start of the year, SMWB stock has gained almost 37% of equity value. However, since March, it has noticeably lost momentum. Still, this could be an opportunity for stocks to buy under $10.\n\nAt the moment, SMWB stock trades hands at 2.52X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s just below the average of 2.53X seen between the first quarter of last year to Q1 of this year. What\u2019s more, Similarweb is significantly undervalued relative to the application software space, which runs an average multiple of 4.14X. Therefore, the company has room to expand into a fair valuation point.\n\nMoreover, analysts see sustained growth ahead. In fiscal 2024, sales could rise to $244.76 million, implying a growth rate of 12.3%. The high-side target calls for revenue of $247 million. Looking to the following year, the top line may jump to $278.3 million, up 13.7%. That makes SMWB an intriguing idea for stocks to buy under $10.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the basic materials sector, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) runs an \u201cupstream\u201d gold-mining business. That means it\u2019s engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of gold properties. These projects are located in the U.S., Brazil, Chile, Canada and Mauritania. Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve potentially about to shift its monetary policy to a dovish framework may lift KGC due to the inflationary implications.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be fair, KGC stock right now trades at 2.54X sales. In the past year, this metric sat at 1.69X. Relatively speaking, Kinross appears overvalued. However, the gold industry runs an average revenue multiple of 3.14X. Therefore, even with KGC\u2019s recent robust rally, it still has room to grow.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are targeting sales of $4.7 billion. If so, that would be up 11% from the prior year\u2019s result of $4.24 billion. The high-side target calls for sales of $5 billion. What\u2019s perhaps most impressive is that the least-optimistic view still comes in at $4.45 billion.\n\nCombined with the forward dividend yield of 1.33% and a favorable fundamental backdrop, KGC is one of the stocks to buy under $10.\n\nBaytex Energy (BTE) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Canada, Baytex Energy (NYSE:BTE) falls under the oil and gas exploration and production segment of the hydrocarbon value chain. As mentioned earlier, this segment is known as upstream. Fundamentally, geopolitics could play a huge role in the price action of BTE stock. With western nations needing more reliable sources of fossil fuels, Baytex just might get very intriguing.\n\nAnother factor to consider here is the valuation. Currently, the market prices BTE stock at 1.03X trailing-year sales. That matches the ratio seen during the past year and that\u2019s a very good thing. The upstream energy sector\u2019s average price-to-sales ratio stands at 2.15X. Thus, plenty of room exists for Baytex to run.\n\nIndeed, analysts are looking for sales to hit $2.8 billion by year\u2019s end. If so, that would represent a gargantuan growth rate of 40.7% from last year\u2019s haul of $1.99 billion. The high-side estimate calls for sales of $3.22 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that Baytex offers a forward dividend yield of 1.77%. Thus, it makes a sensible idea for stocks to buy under $10.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should Value Investors Buy Kinross Gold (KGC) Stock?",
        "content": "Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.\n\nOf these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.\n\nIn addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.\n\nOne stock to keep an eye on is Kinross Gold (KGC). KGC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 16.49, while its industry has an average P/E of 16.57. Over the last 12 months, KGC's Forward P/E has been as high as 19 and as low as 10.88, with a median of 13.74.\n\nValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. KGC has a P/S ratio of 2.53. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.3.\n\nFinally, investors will want to recognize that KGC has a P/CF ratio of 7.74. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. KGC's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 13.10. Within the past 12 months, KGC's P/CF has been as high as 7.74 and as low as 4.18, with a median of 5.44.\n\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Kinross Gold is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, KGC feels like a great value stock at the moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per the previous forecast, Barrick expects its gold and copper production in 2024 to progressively increase each quarter, with a higher weighting in the second half of the year. This will likely keep GOLD on track to meet its full-year gold and copper guidance.\n\nIn the second quarter, the average market price for gold was $2,338 per ounce. The average market price for copper was $4.42 per pound.\n\nThe preliminary second-quarter gold production surpassed first-quarter levels due to increased production at Turquoise Ridge following the completed maintenance at the Sage autoclave in the first quarter, the continued successful ramp-up at Porgera and significant increases at Tongon, North Mara and Kibali. These gains were partially offset by planned lower production at Cortez and Phoenix. Pueblo Viejo's production remained steady as throughput ramped up with a shift to recovery rate optimization in the second half of 2024.\n\nBarrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nBarrick Gold Corporation price-consensus-chart | Barrick Gold Corporation Quote\n\nCompared with the first-quarter tally, second-quarter gold costs of sales per ounce and total cash costs per ounce are expected to be 0 to 2% higher. Without the second-quarter increase in gold prices and the resulting higher royalties, total cash costs per ounce would have been lower compared to the first quarter. All-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to rise by 1% to 3%. However, costs are anticipated to decline in the year's second half as production ramps up.\n\nPreliminary second-quarter copper production was higher than in the first quarter, primarily due to higher grades and recoveries at Lumwana following the ramp-up in stripping activities and a planned shutdown in the first quarter. Compared with first-quarter 2024 levels, second-quarter copper cost of sales per pound is expected to be 4-6% lower, C1 cash costs per pound are expected to be 8-10% lower, while all-in sustaining costs per pound are expected to be 1-3% higher due to increased waste stripping at Lumwana. Copper costs are also expected to decline in the second half of the year as production ramps up.\n\nBarrick will provide a detailed discussion and analysis of its second-quarter 2024 production and sales when it reports its quarterly results before the opening bell on Aug 12, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarrick\u2019s shares have gained 9.1% in the past year compared with a 14.6% rise of the\u00a0industry.

        "title": "5 PEG-Based GARP Stocks to Buy Ahead of Elections",
        "content": "Ahead of the U.S. presidential election, investors are quite certain about a probable increase in volatility in the equity space. Considering the diverse focus and agenda of the parties, conditional to the voting outcome, a number of sectors are bound to see growth compared to others. While a few months are still left for investors to clearly understand which sectors to put more money in and which sectors to exit, it will be a prudent idea now to follow a hybrid investment strategy to minimize the risk of this external volatility.\n\nHere, to find an answer, we resort to the investing track of the Oracle of Omaha, where he has shown a gradual shift from being a pure-play value investor to a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor.\n\nThe GARP theory enables strategic mingling of growth and value-investing principles, which gives us a hybrid strategy by utilizing the best features of both. What GARPers look for is whether or not the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).\n\nSeveral stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here, we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These are BRF S.A. BRFS, Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, B2Gold Corp. BTG, Kinross Gold KGC and E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. ETWO.\n\nA Few More Words on GARP\n\nGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics \u2014 the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.\n\nThe PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate\n\nIt relates stocks\u2019 P/E ratio with their future earnings growth rates.\n\nWhile P/E alone gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps identify stocks with solid future potential.\n\nA lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.\n\nSay for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio indicating both undervaluation and future growth potential.\n\nUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.\n\nThere are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio, though. It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, PEG-based investing can be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.\n\nHere are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:\n\nPEG Ratio less than X Industry Median\n\nP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose)\n\nZacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1\u00a0or #2 have a proven history of success.)\n\nMarket Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)\n\nAverage 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nPercentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.\n\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold), offer the best upside potential.\n\nHere are five out of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nBRF: Brazil\u2019s consumer staple stock BRF raises, produces and slaughters poultry and pork for processing, production, and sale of fresh meat, processed products, pasta, margarine, pet food, and other products. The company also provides frozen whole and cut chicken, frozen pork and turkey and halal products for Islamic markets.\n\nBRF can be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 36.7%.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nHilton Grand Vacations: The company is recognized as a leading global timeshare company and is the exclusive vacation ownership partner of Hilton. With headquarters in Orlando, FL, Hilton Grand Vacations develops, markets, and operates a system of brand-name, high-quality vacation ownership resorts in select vacation destinations.\n\nHilton Grand Vacations stock can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and Value Score of B. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, Hilton Grand Vacations has a solid long-term historical growth rate of 8.8%.\n\nB2Gold: Vancouver-based B2Gold is a gold producer with three operational mines (one each in Mali, Namibia and the Philippines). The company also has a portfolio of other evaluation and exploration assets in Mali, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Namibia and Finland.

Kinross Gold runs several mines, including Fort Knox, Round Mountain and Bald Mountain in the United States; La Coipa in Chile; Tasiast in Mauritania and Paracatu in Brazil.

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nWhile you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nDifferent than value or growth investors, momentum-oriented investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC)\n\nBased in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. It ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the world, with a 2023 production of around 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces. The company's operations are primarily located in - the Americas (roughly 71% of 2023 production). It holds major assets in Canada and the United States. It is mainly involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. Kinross also produces and sells silver.\n\nKGC is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with a Momentum Style Score of A and VGM Score of A. Shares are up 6.3% over the past one week and up 23.4% over the past four weeks. KGC has gained 79.5% in the last one-year period as well. Looking at trading volume, an average of 15,606,075 shares exchanged hands over the last 20 trading days.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for momentum investors as well. For fiscal 2024, four analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for KGC, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $0.55 per share. KGC also boasts an average earnings surprise of 46%.\n\nKGC should be on investors' short list because of its impressive earnings fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Momentum and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Freshpet and CF Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 16, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Freshpet FRPT as the Bull of the Day and CF Industries (CF) asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Barrick Gold Corp. GOLD, Kinross Gold Corp. KGC and Franco-Nevada Corp. FNV.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nFreshpet FRPT, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a pet food company that manufactures, distributes, and markets meals and treats for dogs and cats. Renewed strength in the consumer staples sector provides a durable backing for this industry leader. Freshpet shares have begun to display relative strength, recently surging to 52-week highs. Increasing volume has attracted investor attention as buying pressure accumulates in this top-ranked stock.\n\nFreshpet is part of the Zacks Food \u2013 Miscellaneous industry group, which currently ranks in the top 43% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nThis industry contains stocks that are currently undervalued based on traditional metrics.\n\nQuantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock\u2019s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.\n\nCompany Description\n\nFreshpet provides a variety of natural foods and refrigerated meals in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The company offers meat-based products such as chicken and beef; vegetable products such as carrots and leafy greens; and high-fiber products such as brown rice and oats.\n\nThe pet food retailer prides itself on high quality proteins and farm-fresh fruits and vegetables. Their healthy meals are steam-cooked, locking in vital nutrients as opposed to other cooking methods. Under the oversight of their veterinary nutritionists, Freshpet ensures its meals are prepared according to the highest food safety standards.\n\nThe Secaucus, New Jersey-based company sells its products under the Freshpet, Dognation, and Dog Joy labels through various retail channels including grocery, mass, club, pet specialty, as well as online.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Trends and Future Estimates\n\nFreshpet has put together an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Back in May, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $0.21/share, a 195.5% surprise over the -$0.22/share consensus estimate. Freshpet has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 118.2%.\n\nFRPT stock received a boost as analysts covering the company have been increasing their 2024 earnings estimates lately. For the full year, earnings estimates have risen 45.95% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.54/share, reflecting a potential growth rate of 177.1% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to climb 24.8% to $957.4 million.\n\nLet\u2019s Get Technical\n\nThis market leader has seen its stock advance nearly 50% in 2024 alone. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to experience this type of outperformance. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio \u2013 one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWith positive fundamental and technical indicators, FRPT stock is poised to continue its outperformance.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Freshpet has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and Freshpet continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFreshpet is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with a best-in-class \u2018A\u2019 rating in our Momentum category and a second-best \u2018B\u2019 rating in our Growth category. This indicates that FRPT stock is likely to continue its strong momentum based on a favorable combination of earnings and sales growth.\n\nBacked by a top industry group and an impressive history of earnings beats, it\u2019s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. The future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCF Industries is a global manufacturer and distributor of nitrogen fertilizer. The company manufactures and sells hydrogen and nitrogen products for fertilizer, energy, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities.\n\nIts principal products include anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, and ammonium nitrate. The company primarily serves cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, wholesalers, and industrial users. CF Industries was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Northbrook, IL.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nCF Industries, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fertilizers industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 22% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months \u2013 just as it has year-to-date.\n\nCandidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a lackluster industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.\n\nAlong with many other fertilizer stocks, CF stock experienced a climax top in 2022 amid the peak in inflation and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The stock is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as we move into the latter half of the year.\n\nRecent Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook\n\nCF Industries has fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. Back in May, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.03/share, missing the $1.47/share Zacks Consensus estimate by -29.93%.\n\nCF Industries has posted an average earnings miss of -4.6% over the last four quarters. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and CF is no exception.\n\nThe fertilizer company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the most recent quarter, analysts have decreased estimates by -2.08% in the past 60 days. The Q2 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $1.88/share, reflecting negative growth of -30.37% relative to the year-ago period.\n\nFalling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.\n\nThe company faces headwinds from lower nitrogen prices. Higher global supply availability, driven by higher global operating rates, has resulted in a decline in prices. The weak pricing environment is expected to continue, dampening company sales and margins.\n\nTechnical Outlook\n\nAs illustrated below, CF stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has plunged below both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day moving averages (red line). The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages are sloping down \u2013 another good sign for the bears.\n\nWhile not the most accurate indicator, CF has also experienced what is known as a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d whereby the stock\u2019s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. CF Industries would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen more than 10% this year alone.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make new highs anytime soon. The fact that CF Industries is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock\u2019s downtrend.\n\nPotential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of CF until the situation shows major signs of improvement.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nRise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV\n\nGold prices plunged below the $1,650 mark by the end of 2022 but recovered and settled above $2,000 an ounce last year amid geopolitical unrest and recession apprehensions. In 2024, gold prices have remained bullish so far as central banks across the globe have shown interest in acquiring the yellow metal.\n\nAn uptick in consumer demand is surely expected to boost the price of the bullion metal further, with market pundits projecting gold prices to scale above $3,000 an ounce by 2025. Gold prices are currently hovering well above the $2,400 mark and are looking forward to entering another growth phase buoyed by interest rate cut optimism.\n\nThe slowdown in price pressures and soft economic data bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in the latter part of the year, a blessing in disguise for gold prices vis-\u00e0-vis gold mining stocks such as\u00a0Barrick Gold Corp., Kinross Gold Corp. and Franco-Nevada Corp.\n\nInflation Ebbing\n\nThe monthly consumer prices dipped in June for the first time since the pandemic in 2020, with the consumer price index (CPI) declining 0.1% after remaining flat in May, per the Labor Department. Year-over-year, the CPI slowed to 3% in June from 3.3% in May. The 12-month rate is now at its lowest level since April 2021.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditure index, was unchanged in May, a tell-tale sign that inflationary pressure is losing its tight grip on the economy.\n\nWeak Economic Data\n\nEconomic growth, meanwhile, lost momentum at the end of the second quarter. A sharp decline in orders led to a slump in service sector activity, with the non-manufacturing PMI plunging to a four-year low in June.\n\nManufacturing activity also contracted for the third successive month in June. Softening demand for goods took a toll on manufacturing activity despite improvements in business investment.\n\nSlowdown in Job Additions\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that the jobless rate jumped to its highest in June since October 2021. This is an indication that the labor market is cooling down.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which includes part-time jobs and discouraged workers, continues to be at elevated levels, while job additions dipped in June from the prior month.\n\nOdds of a Fed Rate Cut Rise\n\nInterest rates, at the moment, are at record-high levels to curb the relentless rise in the cost of consumer goods and services. However, with inflation ebbing amid a slowdown in economic growth, the Fed is expected to trim rates as early as fall.\n\nMarket participants are now expecting at least two rate cuts by the end of this year, while the odds of a September rate cut by a quarter-point have now gone up by 88% compared to a probability of 52% a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nRate Cuts Are a Boon for GOLD, KGC, FNV\n\nIn a low-interest-rate environment, fixed-income investments such as bonds will lose their attractiveness as money will flow out of such high-yielding investments and into gold. This, in turn, will lead to a jack-up in the price of the yellow metal and improve the profit margins of gold mining stocks, including Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold and Franco-Nevada. These stocks, currently, possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBarrick Gold\n\nBarrick Gold is one of the largest gold mining companies in the world and has operations in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 5.9% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 27.4%.\n\nKinross Gold\n\nKinross Gold has major assets in Canada and the United States. Kinross Gold is engaged in the exploration of gold mines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 6.1% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18.2%.\n\nFranco-Nevada\n\nFranco-Nevada operates as a gold-focused royalty and stream company. It holds interest in several energy assets worldwide, including the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 2.5% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 9.5%.\n\nShares of Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold and Franco-Nevada have gained 2.4%, 52.2%, and 16.5%, respectively, so far this year.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of\u00a0+44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "PPG Industries (PPG) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "PPG Industries Inc. PPG is set to release second-quarter 2024 results after the closing bell on Jul 18.\r\n\r\nPPG Industries beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters while delivering in-line results on the other occasion. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 3.3%, on average. The paint giant is expected to have benefited from acquisitions, pricing actions and restructuring cost savings in the second quarter. However, its performance is likely to have been impacted by weak demand, especially in Europe.\r\n\r\nPPG's shares are down 13.4% in the past year compared with a 13.6% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,921.3 million, which implies a rise of around 1% from the year-ago reported number. \u00a0\r\n\r\nOur estimate for PPG\u2019s Industrial Coatings segment\u2019s net sales is pegged at $1,831.9 million, flat on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nAlso, our estimate for net sales for the Performance Coatings segment stands at $3,101.8 million, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 2%.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nPPG is likely to have benefited from higher pricing, manufacturing efficiencies, cost actions and efforts to grow its business through acquisitions in the second quarter. The company is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy and optimizing its working capital requirements.\r\n\r\nThe cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has made considerable cost-cutting efforts, focused especially on locations and end markets with poor economic conditions. The company achieved $8 million of incremental cost savings in first-quarter 2024. It expects an additional $7-$9 million in restructuring savings in the second quarter. \r\n\r\nPPG is raising selling prices across its business segments to offset cost inflation and drive profitability. It witnessed a year-over-year improvement in consolidated segment margin in the first quarter. Notably, the first quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Pricing actions are likely to have aided its margins in the June quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company is taking steps to build its business inorganically by making value-creating acquisitions. Acquisition contributions are expected to reflect on the company's second-quarter performance. Acquisitions such as Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon are likely to have supported its top line.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company remains exposed to exposed to soft demand conditions in Europe and China. Industrial production remains subdued, primarily attributed to cautious consumer purchasing patterns in Europe and a slow recovery in China. Additionally, weakened demand in specific end-use markets within the United States has contributed to the challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nPPG is seeing lower sales volumes for automotive refinish coatings in the United States partly due to weaker body shop activities. Geopolitical tensions in Europe stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict have further dampened demand. Weak demand is likely to have impacted volumes in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nWhile PPG is seeing improved demand for its products in China, it remains challenged by lower overall demand in Europe. The company expects global industrial production and demand in Europe to remain at low levels in the second quarter. The softness in industrial coatings is expected to have continued in the second quarter due to the sluggish global industrial production.\n\nPPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPPG Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PPG Industries, Inc. Quote\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PPG Industries this season.

        "title": "Rise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV",
        "content": "Gold prices plunged below the $1,650 mark by the end of 2022 but recovered and settled above $2,000 an ounce last year amid geopolitical unrest and recession worries. In 2024, gold prices have remained bullish so far as central banks across the globe have shown interest in acquiring the yellow metal.\n\nAn uptick in consumer demand is surely expected to boost the price of the bullion metal further, with market pundits projecting gold prices to scale above $3,000 an ounce by 2025. Gold prices are currently hovering well above the $2,400 mark and are looking forward to entering another growth phase buoyed by interest rate cut optimism.\n\nThe slowdown in price pressures and soft economic data bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in the latter part of the year, a blessing in disguise for gold prices vis-\u00e0-vis gold mining stocks such as Barrick Gold Corporation GOLD, Kinross Gold Corporation KGC and Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV.\n\nInflation Ebbing\n\nThe monthly consumer prices dipped in June for the first time since the pandemic in 2020, with the consumer price index (CPI) declining 0.1% after remaining flat in May, per the Labor Department. Year-over-year, the CPI slowed to 3% in June from 3.3% in May. The 12-month rate is now at its lowest level since April 2021.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditure index, was unchanged in May, a tell-tale sign that inflationary pressure is losing its tight grip on the economy.\n\nWeak Economic Data\n\nEconomic growth, meanwhile, lost momentum at the end of the second quarter. A sharp decline in orders led to a slump in service sector activity, with the non-manufacturing PMI plunging to a four-year low in June.\n\nManufacturing activity also contracted for the third successive month in June. Softening demand for goods took a toll on manufacturing activity despite improvements in business investment.\n\nSlowdown in Job Additions\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that the jobless rate jumped to its highest in June since October 2021. This is an indication that the labor market is cooling down.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which includes part-time jobs and discouraged workers, continues to be at elevated levels, while job additions dipped in June from the prior month.\n\nOdds of a Fed Rate Cut Rise\n\nInterest rates, at the moment, are at record-high levels to curb the relentless rise in the cost of consumer goods and services. However, with inflation ebbing amid a slowdown in economic growth, the Fed is expected to trim rates as early as fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket participants are now expecting at least two rate cuts by the end of this year, while the odds of a September rate cut by a quarter-point have now gone up by 88% compared to a probability of 52% a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nRate Cuts Are a Boon for GOLD, KGC, FNV\n\nIn a low-interest-rate environment, fixed-income investments such as bonds will lose their attractiveness as money will flow out of such high-yielding investments and into gold. This, in turn, will lead to a jack-up in the price of the yellow metal and improve the profit margins of gold mining stocks, including Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold and Franco-Nevada. These stocks, currently, possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBarrick Gold\n\nBarrick Gold is one of the largest gold mining companies in the world and has operations in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 5.9% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 27.4%.\n\nKinross Gold\n\nKinross Gold has major assets in Canada and the United States. Kinross Gold is engaged in the exploration of gold mines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 6.1% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18.2%.\n\nFranco-Nevada\n\nFranco-Nevada operates as a gold-focused royalty and stream company. It holds interest in several energy assets worldwide, including the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 2.5% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 9.5%.\n\nShares of Barrick Gold, Kinross Gold and Franco-Nevada have gained 2.4%, 52.2%, and 16.5%, respectively, so far this year.

        "title": "Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Kinross Gold (KGC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 24.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $9.29 in the previous session. Kinross Gold has gained 52.2% since the start of the year compared to the -1.2% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 22% return for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 7, 2024, Kinross Gold reported EPS of $0.1 versus consensus estimate of $0.06.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Kinross Gold is expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share on $4.58 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.18% change in EPS on an 8.13% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.60 per share on $4.4 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.96% and -4.03%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nKinross Gold may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nKinross Gold has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 16.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 7.4X versus its peer group's average of 10.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Kinross Gold currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Kinross Gold passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Kinross Gold shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nHow Does KGC Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of KGC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO). EGO has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Eldorado Gold Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 80%, and for the current fiscal year, EGO is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $1.26 billion.\n\nShares of Eldorado Gold Corporation have gained 12.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 15.14X and a P/CF of 9.03X.\n\nThe Mining - Gold industry is in the top 23% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for KGC and EGO, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.\u2019s AXTA shares have gained 12.4% in the past three months. The company also outperformed the\u00a0industry\u2019s rise of 2% and topped the S&P 500\u2019s 11.7% rise over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s look at the factors driving the stock\u2019s price appreciation.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving Axalta Coating?\n\nIn the first quarter, Axalta Coating delivered impressive results, registering a 37.1% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings. Quarterly sales inched up 0.8%, reaching $1.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA saw a substantial jump to $259 million from $213 million, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 20%, up 340 basis points (bps) from the previous year\u2019s levels.\n\nThe Performance Coatings segment maintained steady net sales while its adjusted EBITDA climbed 16% year over year to $196 million, achieving a margin of 23.1%. The Mobility Coatings segment experienced 2% growth in net sales, bolstered by strong volume growth in China. Despite minor headwinds from raw material-indexed contracts, the Light Vehicle's price and product mix remained nearly flat. The segment's adjusted EBITDA soared to $63 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2%, up 410 bps from the previous year\u2019s tally.\n\nAxalta raised its full-year 2024 earnings and free cash flow outlook based on robust first-quarter results and strategic initiatives to boost profits.\n\nAXTA recently completed the acquisition of The CoverFlexx Group from Transtar Holding Company. The acquisition enhances Axalta's Refinish business by incorporating CoverFlexx's extensive range of automotive refinish and aftermarket coatings, including primers, basecoats, clearcoats, and various detailing products. The CoverFlexx Group, which generated $78 million in revenue in 2023, employs over 120 people and operates facilities in Michigan and Ontario.\n\nAxalta outperformed expectations in the first quarter, posting adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. The company achieved an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of approximately 7%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axalta's 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.98, reflecting year-over-year growth of 26.1%. The consensus estimate for the current year has been revised upward by 6% in the past 60 days, indicating strong growth potential. Earnings are projected to register a 45.7% increase in second-quarter 2024.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nAxalta currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the Basic Materials space are Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, Eldorado Gold Corporation EGO and Kinross Gold Corporation KGC. Carpenter Technology and Eldorado Gold sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Kinross carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRS\u2019s current-year earnings is pegged at $4.35, indicating a year-over-year rise of 282%. CRS\u2019 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while matching it once, the average earnings surprise being 15.1%. The company\u2019s shares have soared 98.5% in the past year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EGO\u2019s current-year earnings is pegged at $1.09, indicating a year-over-year rise of 91.2%. EGO\u2019s earnings estimates have gone up 10% in the past 60 days. EGO beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 430.7%. The stock has rallied 48.2% in the past year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kinross's current-year earnings is pegged at 52 cents, indicating a rise of 18.2% from the year-ago levels.

        "title": "The 3 Best Gold Stocks to Buy Now: July Edition",
        "content": "Last year, gold prices surged as investors sought alternatives to hedge their portfolios against rising inflation and economic uncertainty. Gold prices increased by over 13%, and demand for the precious metal reached 4,899 metric tons. This has contributed to the profitability of the gold industry this year, making gold stocks ideal investment options in the stock market.\n\nFurthermore, conflicts in the Middle East and several other global incidents have contributed to the demand for gold this year. This is evident from the performance of gold ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:GLD), which increased by over 14% year-to-date.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the demand for gold stocks is at an all-time high, and many investors are interested in them. This article highlights three of the best gold stocks to invest in this July.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEquinox Gold (EQX) Gold nuggets on top of American paper money representing gold stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEquinox Gold (NYSE:EQX) is a Canadian growth-focused mining company that operates solely in the Americas. It has eight gold mines spread over several countries, including Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and the U.S., all working towards the goal of achieving over a million ounces of annual gold production.\n\nEquinox Gold established itself as a formidable player in the gold industry at the height of the gold price surge last year. It generated over 150,000 ounces of gold during that period, and 546,000 ounces total that year. While it has not been able to replicate its previous feats this year, the company has performed reasonably well and is currently undergoing an expansion phase.\n\nIt recently acquired the remaining interest in Greenstone Gold Mine, a Canadian gold mining outfit. The company announced the Greenstone gold mine will begin production later this year and will be one of the largest gold mines in the country.\n\nOn the financial front, Equinox Gold has not performed too poorly this year. Its recent quarterly report indicates decent earnings across key metrics, such as revenue and net income.\n\nAlamos Gold (AGI) Closeup of a large gold nugget. stocks under $10\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlamos Gold (NYSE:AGI) is a Canadian intermediate gold producer and mining outfit. It operates three gold mines across Canada and Mexico and boasts several growth projects in Turkey and the US.\n\nThe combination of a diversified asset base, life-long gold production and a portfolio of impressive, diverse, low-cost growth projects makes Alamos Gold an attractive option for stock market investors. The company\u2019s commitment to global sustainability practices is another factor that makes it attractive. It is notable for its low-cost production profile and advocacy for sustainable mining practices, evidenced by its latest ESG report.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company has recently embarked on an expansion phase, acquiring Argonaut Gold, a low-cost North American gold producer. It announced via a press release that it will merge both operations to create \u201cone of the largest and lowest cost gold mines in Canada.\u201d\n\nThe addition of the Argonaut mine is expected to increase Alamos Gold\u2019s production to over 600,000 per year and potentially exceed 900,000 ounces per year in the long term.\n\nFinancially, Alamos Gold is one of the gold industry\u2019s best performers. It consistently delivers strong production results, as seen by its latest quarterly report where it saw a 25% increase in revenue, generating an all-time high of $1 billion. Its earnings per share also increased by almost 500% and generated an impressive $124 million in free cash flow from operations.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T.

        "title": "Is Centerra Gold (CGAU) Stock Undervalued Right Now?",
        "content": "Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.\n\nOf these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.\n\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\n\nOne company value investors might notice is Centerra Gold (CGAU). CGAU is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.19. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.99. Over the past year, CGAU's Forward P/E has been as high as 212.86 and as low as 9.71, with a median of 13.88.\n\nWe should also highlight that CGAU has a P/B ratio of 0.84. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.36. Over the past year, CGAU's P/B has been as high as 0.94 and as low as 0.57, with a median of 0.75.\n\nValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CGAU has a P/S ratio of 1.29. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.37.\n\nFinally, investors will want to recognize that CGAU has a P/CF ratio of 7.30. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.39. Within the past 12 months, CGAU's P/CF has been as high as 27.27 and as low as -18.01, with a median of 6.53.\n\nAnother great Mining - Gold stock you could consider is Kinross Gold (KGC), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.\n\nStory continues\n\nKinross Gold is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 15.87 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.53. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 15.99 and average PEG ratio of 0.52.\n\nKGC's Forward P/E has been as high as 19 and as low as 10.88, with a median of 13.73. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.13, as low as 0.41, with a median of 0.95.\n\nKinross Gold sports a P/B ratio of 1.75 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 1.36. In the past 52 weeks, KGC's P/B has been as high as 1.75, as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.10.\n\nValue investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Centerra Gold and Kinross Gold are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, CGAU and KGC sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.9% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $16.72 in the previous session. Eldorado Gold Corporation has gained 27.9% since the start of the year compared to the -2% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 21.2% return for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2024, Eldorado Gold reported EPS of $0.27 versus consensus estimate of $0.15.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Eldorado Gold is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share on $1.26 billion in revenues. This represents a 91.23% change in EPS on a 24.98% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.02 per share on $1.39 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -6.88% and 9.73%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nEldorado Gold may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nEldorado Gold has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 16.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9.1X versus its peer group's average of 10X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.3. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Eldorado Gold currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Eldorado Gold fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Eldorado Gold shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nHow Does EGO Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of EGO have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC). KGC has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Kinross Gold Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 66.67%, and for the current fiscal year, KGC is expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share on revenue of $4.5 billion.\n\nShares of Kinross Gold Corporation have gained 24.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 17.54X and a P/CF of 7.38X.\n\nThe Mining - Gold industry is in the top 19% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for EGO and KGC, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Steel Dynamics (STLD) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
        "content": "Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD is set to release second-quarter 2024 results after the closing bell on Jul 17.\r\n\r\nSteel Dynamics\u2019 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while beat once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 0.5%, on average. The company posted an earnings surprise of around 3.7% in the last reported quarter. Its second-quarter results are likely to have been impacted by lower profitability in steel operations.\r\n\r\nShares of STLD have gained 20.3% in the past year compared with a 10.9% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat do the Estimates Say?\n\nSteel Dynamics envisions second-quarter earnings in the range of $2.64-$2.68 per share.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Steel Dynamics for the to-be-reported quarter is pinned at $4,416.8 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 13.1%.\n\nA Few Factors to Watch\n\nLower profitability in the company\u2019s steel operations is expected to have hurt its second-quarter results. Lower prices are likely to have weighed on the segment\u2019s performance. However, STLD is expected to have benefited from strong demand in major end markets, which is expected to have supported its shipment volumes in the June quarter.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for total steel shipments is pegged at roughly 3.26 million tons for the second quarter, stable both on a year-over-year and sequential comparison basis.\r\n\r\nSteel Dynamics, last month, said that it sees a notable decline in profitability from its steel operations in second-quarter 2024 compared with the first quarter\u2019s tally, primarily due to lower realized pricing despite steady shipment levels. Domestic steel demand remains stable, but buying hesitancy persists due to a weakening scrap price environment. Demand continues to be driven by the automotive, non-residential construction, energy and industrial sectors, STLD noted.\r\n\r\nThe company expects second-quarter earnings from its metals recycling operations to surpass first-quarter results, driven by stronger volumes in ferrous and non-ferrous materials. Steel fabrication operations\u2019 earnings are projected to be in line with first-quarter numbers, with increased shipments balancing lower realized pricing. The non-residential construction sector remains robust, highlighted by a strong backlog of steel joist and deck orders extending into fourth-quarter 2024, with historically high product pricing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, U.S. steel prices have seen a significant downward correction this year after a strong run in late 2023 that extended into early 2024. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices retreated since early 2024, with prices plummeting to below $800 per short ton in March 2024 from $1,200 per short ton at the start of the year. The decline was influenced by a concoction of factors, including a pullback in steel mill lead times, an oversupply of steel exacerbated by increased imports, reduced demand from key industries and global economic uncertainties. U.S. HRC prices continue their downward slide, being pressured by an influx of imports, currently hovering below the $700 per short ton level.\r\n\r\nLower average realized selling prices are likely to have hurt STLD\u2019s margins in the quarter to be reported. Our estimate for second-quarter average external selling price for the company\u2019s steel operations stands at $1,092, suggesting a 12.7% year-over-year decline a 9.1% sequential decrease.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Steel Dynamics this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that\u2019s not the case here.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Steel Dynamics is 0.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the second quarter is currently pegged at $2.67. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Steel Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStocks That Warrant a Look\n\nHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:\r\n\r\nAgnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, scheduled to release earnings on Jul 31, has an Earnings ESP of +5.68% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for AEM\u2019s earnings for the second quarter is currently pegged at 81 cents.\r\n\r\nATI Inc. ATI, slated to release earnings on Aug 6, has an Earnings ESP of +3.50% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for ATI\u2019s second-quarter earnings is currently pegged at 58 cents.\r\n\r\nKinross Gold Corporation KGC, scheduled to release second-quarter earnings on Jul 31, has an Earnings ESP of +27.66%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kinross Gold's earnings for the second quarter is currently pegged at 12 cents.

        "title": "5 Yellow Metal Stocks to Buy for a Stable Portfolio in 2H 2024",
        "content": "Gold prices jumped in 2024 buoyed by increased geopolitical tensions, a depreciating U.S. dollar, the potential for monetary policy easing, and continuous purchasing by central banks. Gold has appreciated more than 15% so far this year. Gold prices are currently around $2,420 an ounce, following the recent release of several key U.S. economic data that were weaker than expected.\n\nThe declining inflation rate as shown by several measures of inflation, soft job additions, a higher unemployment rate and lower consumer spending have fueled expectations that the Fed will start interest rate cut from September.\n\nMoreover, the World Gold Council (WGC) recently said that the gold mining industry is suffering from a scarcity of deposits of the yellow metal. WGC Chief Market Strategist John Reade said \u201cThe bigger picture, I think about mine production is that, effectively, it plateaued around 2016, 2018 and we\u2019ve seen no growth since then.\u201d\n\nAs gold miners have already explored prospective areas, new mines are hard to be identified. Gold mining is a very lengthy process by nature. Moreover, slow-moving government clearances create more hurdles for miners.\n\nHowever, on the demand side, the use of gold in energy, healthcare and technology is rising. India and China account for around 50% of consumers\u2019 gold demand. Economic strength in India is fueling wealth-driven buying.\n\nPhysical demand has also been strong in China due to a weaker yuan, a volatile stock market and comparatively low deposit rates. investors are thus exploring alternatives for their savings.\n\nThe yellow metal has long been considered a safe-haven investment amid financial or political uncertainty. Gold demand continues to be on the rise from central banks. Therefore, there will be an eventual demand-supply imbalance, which is likely to drive gold prices.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five gold stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC)\n\nBased in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. It ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the world, with a 2023 production of around 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces. The company's operations are primarily located in - the Americas (roughly 71% of 2023 production). It holds major assets in Canada and the United States. It is mainly involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. Kinross also produces and sells silver.\n\nKGC sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Mining - Gold industry's P/E of 16X, shares of Kinross Gold are trading at a forward P/E of 16.4X. KGC also has a PEG Ratio of 0.6, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 6.9X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 2.4X.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2024, four analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for KGC, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.03 to $0.52 per share. KGC also holds an average earnings surprise of 46%.\n\nKGC should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive earnings and valuation fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Value and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Play Likely Earnings Beat With 5 Top-Ranked Stocks",
        "content": "It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.\n\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Chewy CHWY, Wingstop WING, Moderna MRNA, Tenet Healthcare THC and Kinross Gold KGC as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn\u2019t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company\u2019s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies\u2019 financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company\u2019s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company\u2019s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks that Can Beat?\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors\u2019 dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company\u2019s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.\n\nLast EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.\n\nIn addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.\n\nEarnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.\n\nIn order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:\n\nNext 3\u20135 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock\u2019s long-term growth prospects.\n\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only 13.\n\nHere are five out of 13 stocks:\n\nChewy: The Zacks Rank #1 company operates as an online pet retailer.

        "title": "How to Find Strong Basic Materials Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nutrien (NTR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.17 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 7, 2024.\n\nNutrien's Earnings ESP sits at 1.88%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.\n\nNTR is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Kinross Gold (KGC).\n\nKinross Gold, which is readying to report earnings on July 31, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.15 a share, and KGC is 23 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nFor Kinross Gold, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.12 is 27.66%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NTR and KGC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "What Makes Kinross Gold (KGC) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
        "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Kinross Gold (KGC), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Kinross Gold currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if KGC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this gold mining company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor KGC, shares are up 9.19% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Gold industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 14.46% compares favorably with the industry's 0.07% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Kinross Gold have increased 32.76% over the past quarter, and have gained 84.53% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 7.37% and 26.79%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also take note of KGC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, KGC is averaging 14,809,397 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with KGC.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost KGC's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.40 to $0.52 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that KGC is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Kinross Gold on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Kinross Gold is CA$11.36 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Kinross Gold's CA$11.33 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 4.2% lower than Kinross Gold's analyst price target of US$11.86\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Kinross Gold\n\nIs Kinross Gold Fairly Valued?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$779.9m US$759.5m US$680.5m US$657.0m US$646.3m US$642.9m US$644.6m US$649.8m US$657.5m US$667.1m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x12 Analyst x9 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ -1.63% Est @ -0.52% Est @ 0.26% Est @ 0.81% Est @ 1.19% Est @ 1.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8%  US$723 US$654 US$543 US$486 US$444 US$410 US$381 US$356 US$334 US$315\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.6b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$667m\u00d7 (1 + 2.1%) \u00f7 (7.8%\u2013 2.1%) = US$12b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$5.6b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$10b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of CA$11.3, the company appears about fair value at a 0.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Kinross Gold as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.244. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Kinross Gold\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Metals and Mining market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the Canadian market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "content": "When we talk about dividend stocks, the focus is generally on blue-chip ideas. These are large companies with strong fundamentals and a stable growth outlook. Further, these blue-chip dividend stocks provide annualized total returns in the range of 10% to 15%.\n\nHowever, there are high-growth dividend stocks that can deliver robust annualized returns. These are typically companies that have initiated dividends in the last few years.\n\nFurther, the stocks discussed represent companies that have potential for significant growth in free cash flows. Therefore, current yield might not be attractive, but dividend growth is likely to be robust in the next few years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn top of these positives, these high-growth dividend stocks are trading at attractive valuations. This backs my view on annual returns of 30% through 2027. Let\u2019s therefore discuss the fundamental reasons to be bullish on these growth ideas.\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nMiniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) looks significantly undervalued at a forward P/E of 18.9. The lifestyle retailer has been on a high-growth trajectory and offers a current dividend yield of 2.06%. I would not be surprised if MNSO stock doubles within the next 36 months.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Miniso reported revenue growth of 26% on a year-on-year basis to $515.7 million. For the same period, the company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 200 basis points to 25.9%. I expect the growth momentum to sustain because of two factors.\n\nFirst, Miniso plans to open 900 to 1,100 new stores annually between 2024 and 2028. During the same period, the lifestyle retailer has guided for revenue growth at a CAGR of over 20%.\n\nFurther, Miniso has a dynamic product portfolio. With new stock keeping units, or SKUs, being introduced on a regular basis, there is a positive impact on growth. At the same time, affordability makes Miniso attractive. This is emphasized by healthy avenue growth amidst macroeconomic challenges.\n\nBorr Drilling (BORR) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy. Oil & Gas Stocks to Avoid\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) is another high-growth dividend stock that looks undervalued. The oil and gas drilling company trades at an attractive forward P/E of 35.17.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Borr announced a quarterly dividend of 10 cents. This would imply a 100% increase in dividends. Further, a robust increase in dividend is an indication of the point that the management is confident of delivering strong upside in revenue and cash flows.\n\nThe growth expectations are backed by continued order intake. For Q1 2024, Borr reported an order intake of $318 million with an average day-rate of 183,000. Currently, the company has 93% contract coverage for 2024 and 71% for 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother point to note is that Borr reported EBITDA of $351 million for 2023. For the year, the offshore driller has guided for EBITDA of $525 million for the mid-range.\n\nWith the contract coverage for 2025 currently at a higher day-rate as compared to this year, healthy EBITDA growth is likely to sustain. With these positives, BORR stock looks deeply undervalued and is poised for a strong rally.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) stock has witnessed a strong rally of 74.5% in the last 12 months. This has been on the back of gold trending higher. However, the gold miner remains attractive at a forward P/E of 23.03 and offers a dividend yield of 1.44%.\n\nThe first point is that gold is currently trading at $2,369.20 an ounce. With the first rate cut likely this year, I expect the precious metal to surge above $2,500 an ounce. Kinross is therefore positioned to benefit in the form of higher realized gold price.\n\nSpecific to Kinross, an investment grade balance sheet provides high flexibility for organic and acquisition driven growth. As of Q1 2024, the gold miner also reported a liquidity buffer of $2 billion.

        "title": "Why This 1 Momentum Stock Could Be a Great Addition to Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nDifferent than value or growth investors, momentum-oriented investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC)\n\nBased in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. It ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the world, with a 2023 production of around 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces. The company's operations are primarily located in - the Americas (roughly 71% of 2023 production). It holds major assets in Canada and the United States. It is mainly involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. Kinross also produces and sells silver.\n\nKGC sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Momentum Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. The stock is up 8.2% and up 2.5% over the past one-week and four-week period, respectively, and Kinross Gold has gained 74.1% in the last one-year period as well. Additionally, an average of 15,697,603 shares were traded over the last 20 trading sessions.\n\nMomentum investors also pay close attention to a company's earnings. For KGC, seven analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.12 to $0.52 per share for 2024. KGC boasts an average earnings surprise of 46%.\n\nInvestors should take the time to consider KGC for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings metrics, and impressive Momentum and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Kinross Gold (KGC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $8.34 in the previous session. Kinross Gold has gained 37.5% since the start of the year compared to the -4.5% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 11.7% return for the Zacks Mining - Gold industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 7, 2024, Kinross Gold reported EPS of $0.1 versus consensus estimate of $0.06.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Kinross Gold is expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share on $4.5 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.18% change in EPS on a 6.05% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.60 per share on $4.4 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.96% and -2.15%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nKinross Gold may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nKinross Gold has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 15.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 6.7X versus its peer group's average of 8.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.54. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Kinross Gold currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Kinross Gold passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Kinross Gold shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 26, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Walmart Inc. WMT and Target Corporation TGT, Kinross Gold KGC, Royal Gold RGLD and Barrick Gold GOLD.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nGold Shines as Weak Retail Sales Lift Rate-Cut Bets: 3 Winners\n\nToward the end of 2022, gold prices took a beating and plummeted below the $1,650 mark. However, gold prices gained momentum and settled above $2000 an ounce in 2023 amid geopolitical and recession anxieties.\n\nIn 2024, gold prices are expected to remain bullish as several banks continue to raise apprehension throughout the stock market. Meanwhile, the crypto market remains dicey, with FTX being the primary culprit.\n\nAt the same time, central banks\u2019 interest in acquiring gold and an increase in consumption demand will surely jack up the price of the bullion metal this year and beyond. Several market participants are now projecting gold prices to surge well over $3,000 an ounce by 2025.\n\nGold prices, in reality, were off to a commendable start this year and are currently above the $2,330 per ounce mark. This means that gold prices are holding above the support level, and are looking to enter another growth phase.\n\nAnd why not? Gold prices are well-poised to pick up steam as moribund consumer spending activity in the United States has fueled hope that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates this year.\n\nBig retailers, including Walmart Inc. and Target Corporation, have begun to cut prices of various products, indicating a slowdown in consumer outlays. To top it, sales at U.S. retailers barely picked up in May, while retail sales in the prior month were substantially revised downward, a tell-tale sign of a deceleration in consumer spending.\n\nThus, it is widely anticipated that the Fed will cut interest rates as early as fall, which is unquestionably a blessing in disguise for gold prices. Needless to say, money won\u2019t be flowing out of gold and into high-yield fixed-income investments, particularly in a low-interest rate environment. By the way, the CME FedWatch Tool shows that 61.1% of market players are expecting a quarter-point trim in interest rates in the September policy meeting.\n\nOn this positive note, it\u2019s prudent for astute investors to keep an eye on gold mining stocks such as Kinross Gold, Royal Gold and Barrick Gold that can make the most of the uptick in gold prices. These stocks, currently, possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nKinross Gold holds major assets in Canada and the United States, and is primarily involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 40.5% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18.2%.\n\nRoyal Gold acquires and manages precious metals stream and royalty interests, with a primary focus on gold. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 7.9% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 28.1%.\n\nBarrick Gold is the largest gold mining company in the world and has mining operations in the United States.

        "title": "The 3 Most Underrated Stocks Under $10 to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market often involves seeking out undervalued gems. For savvy investors, underrated stocks under $10 to buy can present an attractive opportunity.\n\nIn June 2024, there are several candidates in this category that are poised to outperform. The current market environment, characterized by a resilient economy, slowing inflation and shifts in commodity markets presents a unique set of opportunities. Factors such as improving financials, strategic business models and favorable market trends also contribute to their potential.\n\nAdditionally, many of their market capitalizations are relatively small and are underfollowed by market analysts. By identifying the stocks with solid fundamentals, investors can position themselves to outperform the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top three most underrated stocks under $10 to buy in June 2024!\n\nPayoneer Global (PAYO) Payoneer editorial. Illustrative photo for news about Payoneer - an American financial services company.\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayoneer Global (NASDAQ:PAYO) is a financial services company that is a leader in cross-border payments. Trading around $5 a share with a relatively small market capitalization, Payoneer offers robust long-term growth prospects.\n\nPayoneer is relatively new to the stock market, despite being founded nearly two decades ago. The company\u2019s initial public offering back in June 2021 was extremely bad timing, as the U.S. economy\u2019s inflation was just taking off. While an argument could be made that the timing wasn\u2019t right, it may be a blessing in disguise. Despite recent headwinds in the broader economy, Payoneer\u2019s gross profit and cash flows have trended in the right direction. However, the major inflection point for the business began at the end of 2023.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Payoneer achieved its first full year of GAAP profitability as a public company. This is a huge milestone for the small fintech company and it doesn\u2019t plan to be a \u2018\u2019one and done\u2019\u2019 event as well. Given these factors, PAYO stock is a top contender among underrated stocks under $10 to buy in June.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanada-based gold mining company Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) offers investors exposure to the precious metals market. With a diversified portfolio of mines across the Americas and West Africa, Kinross is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.\n\nKinross Gold is a well-established player in the gold mining sector that is often undervalued compared to its peers. The company\u2019s strong operational performance, coupled with its commitment to sustainable mining practices, make it a compelling investment choice. Its focus on cost management and operational efficiency has also enabled it to consistently deliver strong earnings and cash flows in dynamic market environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe miner also has several high-profile assets in its portfolio. The acquisition of Great Bear Resources back in 2022 was a strategic move while the long-term cash flow and profit potential of the Dixie Project significantly enhanced shareholder value. This makes KGC stock one of the top underrated stocks under $10 to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\nFortuna Silver Mines (FSM) Gold and silver bars in front of a grey background.\n\nSource: VladKK / Shutterstock\n\nFortuna Silver Mines (NYSE:FSM) is another Canadian precious metals mining company with operations primarily focused on the production of gold and silver. As investors worry about the declining value of the dollar, hard assets will continue to be in the spotlight.\n\nWhile the stock market remains bullish as inflation continues to subside, global debt and currency depreciation will remain constant. Hard assets like gold and silver will garner more appeal, making the case for precious metal mining companies as a way to outperform.\n\nFortuna has an extensive portfolio of mines with operations in Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Burkina Faso and Cote d\u2019Ivoire. On June 20, Fortuna reported high-grade gold finds at its Seguela mine. Its focus on expanding its production capacity and exploring new opportunities positions it well for future growth. Moreover, rising gold and silver prices further support its long-term revenue, cash flow and profitability goals. With strong exploration potential, FSM stock is one of the best stocks under $10 to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC)\n\nBased in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. It ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the world, with a 2023 production of around 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces. The company's operations are primarily located in - the Americas (roughly 71% of 2023 production). It holds major assets in Canada and the United States. It is mainly involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. Kinross also produces and sells silver.\n\nKGC sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Mining - Gold industry's P/E of 14.9X, shares of Kinross Gold are trading at a forward P/E of 14.4X. KGC also has a PEG Ratio of 0.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 5.9X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 2.1X.\n\nA company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2024, seven analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for KGC, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $0.52 per share. KGC also holds an average earnings surprise of 46%.\n\nWith strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding KGC to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Kinross Gold's (TSE:K) investors will be pleased with their stellar 116% return over the last five years",
        "content": "Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Kinross Gold share price has climbed 98% in five years, easily topping the market return of 33% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 61%, including dividends.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Kinross Gold\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Kinross Gold moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Kinross Gold has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Kinross Gold will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Kinross Gold's TSR for the last 5 years was 116%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Kinross Gold has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 61% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted  1 warning sign for Kinross Gold you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course Kinross Gold may not be the best stock to buy.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Under-$20 Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "I believe that the second half of the year will be bullish for equities. Of course, the first half has not been bad with the S&P 500 index trending higher by 12% for year-to-date. However, with the possibility of rate cuts, it\u2019s likely that the markets will surge higher. This presents a compelling opportunity to invest in some undervalued stocks under $20.\n\nThe price-action is likely to be more in high-beta growth stocks than blue-chip ideas. The focus of this column is therefore on three undervalued stocks under $20 from the growth space that can deliver 100% returns before the end of the year.\n\nAn important point is that the stocks discussed represent companies that are likely to benefit from rate cuts. As an example, lower interest rates are likely to be positive for the struggling automotive industry. Similarly, asset classes like gold, commodities and cryptocurrencies will benefit as rate cuts translate into a weaker currency.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the reasons to believe that these undervalued stocks under $20 are poised to surge higher.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) Person holding cellphone with website of U.S. Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/ Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) is back above $70,000 and it\u2019s likely that the bullish momentum will sustain for the cryptocurrency. Potential rate cuts in the coming quarters will be another catalyst for Bitcoin trending higher. Among crypto stocks, Bitcoin miners look attractive and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) seems to be trading at a valuation gap.\n\nAfter remaining sideways for the last 12 months, RIOT stock trades at a forward P/E of 16. If the expansion plans are executed on time, I expect the Bitcoin miner to skyrocket. From a fundamental perspective, Riot ended Q1 2024 with a cash buffer (including digital assets) of $1.3 billion. Further, with a zero-debt balance sheet, financial flexibility is high to pursue aggressive investments.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company ended the quarter with hash rate capacity of 12.5EH/s. By the end of the year, Riot plans to boost capacity to 31.5EH/s. This is likely to translate into healthy revenue and EBITDA growth. Riot intends to continue boosting its capacity with a target of 100EH/s by 2027. Therefore, there is visibility for sustained upside in revenue and cash flows.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car retail store with customers. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my view, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a steal below $20. In February, LI stock had touched highs of $47.3. The deep correction from those levels has been on the back of relatively low deliveries growth expectations. However, at a forward P/E of 16.6, the EV stock is undervalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor May, Li Auto reported deliveries growth of 23.8% on a year-on-year basis to 35,020 cars. It\u2019s clear that growth numbers are healthy, but significantly lower than growth in the last financial year. This factor however seems to be discounted in LI stock.\n\nAn important point to note is that Li Auto ended Q1 2024 with a strong cash buffer of $13.7 billion. Aggressive retail store expansion in China is likely to continue and will support growth. At the same time, the launch of new models is a growth catalyst.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that Li will explore international expansion in the next 12 to 24 months. If reports are to be believed, the initial markets will be in the Middle-East. This is another potential catalyst for growth for the innovation driven EV company.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage. undervalued stocks under $20\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith gold trending higher, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) stock has rallied by 25% year-to-date. I however believe that KGC stock remains attractively valued at a forward P/E of 14.9. It\u2019s also worth noting that the gold mining stock offers a dividend yield of 1.52% and I expect robust dividend growth.\n\nThe first point to note is that rate cuts are likely before the end of the year. This will be a catalyst for gold surging higher and I would not be surprised if the precious metal trades above $2,500 an ounce. Kinross will benefit from higher realized prices and healthy cash flow upside is likely.\n\nThe gold miner already has an investment grade balance sheet and ended Q1 2024 with a liquidity buffer of $2 billion. With higher realized price, it\u2019s also likely that operating cash flows will be more than $1.5 billion. With high financial flexibility, Kinross is positioned to pursue acquisitions to boost production growth. Currently, the company has guided for stable gold production through 2026.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Low-price dividend stocks are among my favorite bets. A small investor can afford to build a portfolio of regular cash income from these stocks. Of course, the beta of these ideas is not as low as blue-chip dividend stocks. However, the focus of this column is on fundamentally strong undervalued dividend stocks under $10. Backed by strong fundamentals and a positive business outlook, I am bullish on healthy total returns from these ideas in the next 24 months.\n\nOftentimes, dividend stocks under $10 are relatively under-the-radar. That\u2019s a key reason for the valuation gap. Further, expansionary monetary policies will positively impact growth for these companies. This is likely to support stock upside in the coming quarters as revenue growth accelerates.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the fundamental reasons to be bullish on these undervalued stocks under $10.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFF) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith sentiments negative for electric vehicle (EV) stocks, it\u2019s a good time to look at quality names for the long term. Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFF) looks attractive and trades at a forward P/E of 7. This is a clear indication of undervaluation. And, PCRFF stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.7%.\n\nAn important reason to like Panasonic is focus on innovation. It\u2019s likely to ensure that the EV battery maker maintains or increases its market share in the coming years. In December 2023, Panasonic partnered with Sila Nanotechnology for the procurement of next-generation silicon anode material for EV batteries. So, this is likely to help Panasonic in achieving a 25% increase in battery energy density by 2030.\n\nAlso, the battery maker has aggressive capacity expansion plans. Of course, with the slowdown in the industry, expansion will be deferred. However, there is a strong case for healthy revenue and EBITDA growth in the coming years. To put things into perspective, Panasonic expects to quadruple its battery capacity to 200GWh by 2031.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) stock has witnessed a strong rally of 34% year-to-date (YTD). However, the gold miner remains attractive at a forward P/E of 15.3 and offers a dividend yield of 1.48%. In my view, a further rally coupled with strong dividend growth is due in the next 24 months.\n\nImportantly, multiple rate cuts are likely within the next 12 to 18 months. This will be positive for gold, so expect the precious metal to trade above $2,500 an ounce. Kinross Gold will benefit in the form of higher realized price and upside in free cash flows.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecific to KGC, an investment grade balance sheet is a big positive. As of March, the gold miner reported a liquidity buffer of $2 billion. Further, based on Q1 of 2024 results, the annualized operating cash flow is likely to be more than $1.5 billion.\n\nTherefore, there is ample flexibility for capital investments and potential acquisitions to drive production growth. Finally, current assets provide stable production visibility through 2026.\n\nBorr Drilling (BORR) Crude oil tanker and LPG Loading in port at sea view from above. Aerial view oil tanker ship shot from drone. Oil prices, oil shipping, oil stocks.\n\nSource: Avigator Fortuner / Shutterstock.com\n\nBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) is an under-the-radar name that\u2019s worth considering. The stock of the offshore drilling rig service provider has remained subdued in the last 12 months. However, a forward P/E of 11.9 is attractive. And, BORR stock offers a dividend yield of 3%.\n\nWith the possibility of rate cuts in the second half of the year, I am positive on oil trending higher. This is likely to translate into robust order intake for Borr Drilling.\n\nAlso, as of Q1 of 2024, Borr reported an order backlog of $1.66 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. The offshore driller has already guided for EBITDA of $525 million for 2024.\n\nAdditionally, a liquidity buffer of $432.7 million adds to the positives. Borr Drilling has ample flexibility for potential fleet expansion. At the same time, as credit metrics improve, BORR stock is likely to trend higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In 2013, the average stock price was in the range of $30-50. With inflation and rapidly rising valuations, the stock market is getting quite expensive for the everyday investor. While cheap stocks do exist, many carry risks that larger blue chip stocks don\u2019t. This is due to a smaller market cap and higher general volatility. Also, the fact that due to their smaller size, macroeconomic events affect them much more than they affect larger companies.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three cheap stocks that could help your portfolio reach the rate of return you desire. All three companies are in very different sectors, which will help you diversify your portfolio, making it more resilient in the long run.\n\nSirius XM (SIRI) The Sirius XM (SIRI) mobile app logo on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) is an audio entertainment company in North America. It has distinct segments of Sirius XM, Pandora and Off-platform. It provides music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, among other content. Also, it provides podcast and infotainment services on a subscription basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, SIRI has great financials. While revenue did fall between fiscal year 2022 and 2023, a 0.55% decrease was seen with an increase of 4.1% in profit. This indicates that management is prioritizing efficiency, which is a great indicator for investors. And, 11 analysts have given this stock an average growth target of 40.99%.\n\nIn addition, the company is trying to streamline its current products, which includes moving current services to a different platform to increase engagement. New products such as the 360L, which acts as a radio and two-way internet connection point for cars show that the company is innovating behind the scenes.\n\nGoodRX (GRDX) The GoodRx app is displayed on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoodRx Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:GDRX) offers information and tools that enable consumers to compare prices and save on their prescription drug purchases in the U.S. The company operates a price comparison platform that provides consumers with curated, geographically relevant prescription pricing and access to negotiated prices.\n\nAdditionally, GDRX has positive financials, with quarterly revenue growth of 7.60% and an operating margin of 10.30%. The stock has a beta of 1.38, which indicates that the stock is 34% more volatile than the overall market. Also, the beta indicates that the stock is expected to give returns that outpace the market.\n\nSo, with a solid financial performance, innovative technology and a growing suite of services, GoodRx Holdings Inc. is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for affordable healthcare. Recently, it was named one of the 2024 TIME100 Most Influential Companies. Investors looking for a promising stock in the healthcare sector should consider GDRX stock as a valuable addition to their portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) engages in the acquisition, exploration and development of gold properties principally in the U.S, Brazil, Chile, Canada and Mauritania. The company operates the Fort Knox mine and the Manh Choh project in Alaska, along with more projects throughout the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Chile.\n\nCurrently, KGC stock trades at $8.09, with a market cap of almost 10 billion dollars. It has seen positive operating and profit margins of 7.06% and 4.82% respectively, indicating company growth. Also, it has consistently beaten EPS predictions, surprising investors in both Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024.\n\nWith a proven track record of delivering value to shareholders and a portfolio of high-quality assets, Kinross Gold is well-positioned to capitalize on favorable market conditions. However, investors should know that the short-term volatile nature of gold makes this pick a bit more risky than most. Even still, the company\u2019s ongoing exploration and development make Kinross Gold Corp. a great undervalued stock under $10.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors are increasingly looking for robust mining stocks to buy as we approach the second half of 2024. The recovery of the global economy has fueled demand for various metals, from precious metals like gold and silver to base metals like copper and nickel. This surge in demand and supply constraints has pushed prices higher, benefiting mining companies across the board.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing transition to clean energy has become a key tailwind in mining. Analysts point out how it has driven long-term demand for metals like copper, lithium and rare earth elements. They are essential components in data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and solar panels. Recent research suggests that the global mining market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% through 2028. This increase will be driven by further infrastructure development, rising construction activities, and the growing use of autonomous equipment.\n\nWith that information, let\u2019s dive in and explore three compelling mining stocks to buy now that could generate lucrative returns in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCameco (CCJ) CCJ Stock: Hand in long yellow glove holding a chunk of uranium material\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/RHJPhtotoandilustration\n\nWe start discussing mining stocks to buy with the world\u2019s largest publicly traded uranium producer. Regarded as a pure-play investment in nuclear energy, Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) focuses on mining uranium for nuclear reactors. The company owns the largest high-grade uranium reserves and low-cost operations worldwide.\n\nIn its first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results, Cameco\u2019s revenue declined 8% year-over-year (YOY) to C$634 million. The fall was due to the pricing of Cameco\u2019s long-term uranium contracts, which led to uneven revenue recognition across quarters. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined to C$0.13, down from 27 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nGeopolitical factors and green energy initiatives continue to support strong pricing in uranium. As a leading Western uranium miner, Cameco plays a key role in supplying the U.S. nuclear energy sector, recently highlighted by the ban on Russian-enriched uranium imports. Support for nuclear power is also picking up across governments as a way to achieve emissions reduction pledges. Elsewhere, artificial intelligence (AI) is also driving gains in nuclear stocks due to projections for increased electricity demands associated with the technology. Uranium\u2019s high energy density and low carbon emissions make it a prime candidate for powering the energy transition, including data centers and EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date, CCJ stock has returned over 25%. As a result, shares are trading at a premium valuation of 46.8 times forward earnings and 12.3 times trailing sales. Wall Street remains bullish on Cameco stock with a 12-month price target that suggests a potential upside of 3% from current levels. Interested readers may watch the $52 level as a better entry point into CCJ shares.\n\niShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers ETF (PICK) Close-up of a gold-ingot on top of a troy ounce silver and palladium bar. Precious metals. Gold, silver, palladium. materials stocks\n\nSource: corlaffra / Shutterstock\n\nNext on our list of mining stocks to buy is the iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers ETF (NYSEARCA:PICK). This fund provides exposure to a broad range of companies involved in extracting and producing metals and minerals, including precious metals, base metals and rare earth elements.\n\nWe like the diversification this fund offers and its exposure to base metals. The ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy drives robust demand for metals like copper, lithium and rare earth elements. They are essential components in EVs, data centers and renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nPICK currently has over 26 holdings and around $1.32 billion in assets. We should also note that the fund started trading in January 2012. In terms of sectors, diversified metals and mining have the highest allocation (47%), followed by steel (35%) and copper (12%). As a top-heavy fund, the leading 10 names account for around half of the assets in PICK. BHP (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Glencore (NYSE:GLEN) lead the mining stocks in the fund.\n\nSo far in the year, the fund is up just 1.5%. The trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios are 13.7x and 1.7x, respectively. We believe interested readers may find value in PICK around these levels.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion of mining stocks to buy with the\u00a0gold mining company Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC). It has a diverse\u00a0portfolio of\u00a0mines and projects\u00a0across the Americas\u00a0and West Africa, including the Mauritanian Tasiast and the Brazilian Paracatu mines.\n\nInvestors were pleased that Kinross Gold reported impressive first quarter fiscal 2024 results, driven by strong performance at its Tasiast and La Coipa mines. Revenue increased 16% YOY to $1.08 billion, fueled by higher volume and soaring gold prices. Adjusted EPS surged 43% YOY to $0.10, while free cash flow more than tripled to $145 million.\n\nWith\u00a0its strong balance\u00a0sheet and low-cost production, Kinross will likely benefit from investors\u2019 interest in gold due to growing geopolitical tensions. In the first quarter, both margins and production levels increased substantially. Since January, KGC stock has gained 33%. Yet Kinross remains fairly valued at 16.8 times forward earnings and 2.3 times trailing sales. Finally, the 12-month price target for KGC stock suggests an 8% upside potential from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "We recently analyzed latest 13F filings for over 900 hedge funds and analyzed the the 10 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Since Kinross Gold is part of the list, the stock deserves a deeper look. But first, let's see what's happening in the gold industry.\n\nGold jumped earlier this week as investors brace for yet another inflation report. According to Reuters, Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities, said that while he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d on gold, uncertainties regarding the Fed\u2019s moves could keep a lid on gold\u2019s trajectory going forward.\n\nChris Mancini, Gabelli Gold Fund associate portfolio manager, recently talked to CNBC and said that there are signs of stagflation and if Americans begin to pile into gold to offset the effects of this new uncertainty, gold prices could continue to rally. Bob Parker, senior advisor at International Capital Markets Association, said while talking to CNBC that the massive demand for gold from Chinese retail investors has been a major factor behind the latest rally in gold prices. The analyst said there are rumors that the Chinese government may initiate a devaluation of the yuan, and the property crisis in the country is also causing investors to buy gold. The analyst, however, noted that gold prices could see a \u201csetback\u201d soon as inflation is expected to decline.\n\nGold Vs Stocks\n\nWhether or not gold is a better investment when compared to stocks has been a topic of immense debate over the past several decades. Gold is volatile as its price depends on several factors. A report by Stonebridge Capital said that over the past 20 years,\u00a0gold\u2019s returns have surpassed those of stocks, albeit with higher risks. However, when we look at gold\u2019s returns in a 50-year window, it underperformed large-cap stocks. The report also backed a common notion that gold can act as an inflation hedge, saying gold saw a \u201cdramatic\u201d rise in price during the high-inflation periods of the 1970s.\n\nGold\u2019s Expected Movement if the Fed Doesn\u2019t Cut Rates\n\nChris Gaffney, president of World Markets at EverBank, recently said during an interview with Marketwatch that upside to gold would be limited if the Fed decides to go with one rate cut or no rate cut this year. However, the analyst thinks gold could rise and outperform silver amid geopolitical triggers, especially if the conflict in Gaza expands.\n\nMethodology\n\nSince investing in gold mining stocks is one of the best ways for average investors to gain exposure to gold and commodities industry, we decided to take a look at some of the top gold mining stocks hedge funds are buying this year. For this article we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database of 919 hedge funds and picked 10 gold mining stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nAn aerial view of the 1,840 mineral claims spread out over a 274 square mile area for the Pebble Copper-Gold-Molybdenum-Silver-Rhenium project.\n\nKinross Gold Corp (NYSE:KGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nKinross Gold Corp\u00a0(NYSE:KGC)\u00a0earlier this month touched 52-week highs after crushing past analyst estimates.

        "title": "Just Four Days Till Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K) Will Be Trading Ex-Dividend",
        "content": "Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Kinross Gold's shares on or after the 30th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of June.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$0.03 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.12 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Kinross Gold has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current stock price of CA$11.04. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Kinross Gold has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Kinross Gold\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Kinross Gold paid out a comfortable 34% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Kinross Gold generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 30% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Kinross Gold's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 16% a year over the previous five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Kinross Gold's dividend payments per share have declined at 2.8% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's never nice to see earnings and dividends falling, but at least management has cut the dividend rather than potentially risk the company's health in an attempt to maintain it.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs Kinross Gold worth buying for its dividend? Kinross Gold has comfortably low cash and profit payout ratios, which may mean the dividend is sustainable even in the face of a sharp decline in earnings per share. Still, we consider declining earnings to be a warning sign. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.\n\nOn that note, you'll want to research what risks Kinross Gold is facing. For example, Kinross Gold has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Barrick Gold GOLD, Kinross Gold KGC, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Atmos Energy Corp. ATO.\n\n4 Stocks Well-Poised to Gain from Rate Cut Optimism\n\nAs inflation cools down and consumer outlays ebb, market pundits have become more optimistic that the Federal Reserve might implement at least two interest rate cuts this year.\n\nConsumer prices resumed a downward trend in April, with the consumer price index (CPI) increasing 3.4% year over year last month, less than the 3.5% rise in the prior month. The annual rise in consumer prices has dropped considerably from the peak of 9.1% in June 2022.\n\nThe core CPI, which doesn\u2019t include the volatile energy and food costs, also recorded its lowest annual increase in April since the beginning of 2021. The core CPI increased 3.6% annually last month, down from the 3.8% rise in March.\n\nMeanwhile, sales at U.S. retailers remained flat in April, whereas analysts had expected an improvement. The wage growth decline and fewer job additions impacted consumers\u2019 spending tendencies.\n\nThis means the Fed will become more dovish, and market participants are currently pricing in a 64.8% chance of a quarter-point interest rate cut at the central bank\u2019s September policy meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe hopefulness related to interest rate cuts bolstered gold prices. This is because investors tend to gravitate toward the yellow metal over income-generating assets such as bonds during a declining interest rate environment.\n\nAdditionally, an uptick in demand for gold in China and a renewed geopolitical crisis in the Middle East pushed gold prices to record highs. Gold prices have soared more than 18% so far this year, easily outperforming equities and bonds.\n\nAs the bullion metal shines, gold mining stocks like Barrick Gold and Kinross Gold have a fair chance to gain. These stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nCanada-based largest gold mining company, Barrick Gold, operates in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 12.2% over the past 60 days. GOLD\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 20.2%.\n\nSimilarly, Kinross Gold holds major assets in Canada and the United States and is largely involved in the operation of gold mines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 48.5% over the past 60 days. KGC\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 11.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike gold, a lower interest rate scenario bodes well for tech players and capital-intensive utility companies. Decreasing interest rates doesn\u2019t affect tech companies\u2019 future cash inflows, while the debt level decreases for utility companies, helping them pay off dues and register profits. Thus, low interest rates will work wonders for stocks such as NVIDIA Corp. and Atmos Energy Corp. These stocks currently flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.\n\nNVIDIA is a pioneer in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 1.8% over the past 60 days. NVDA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is nearly 88% (read more: NVIDIA a Solid Buy as it Squashes Bubble Fears).\n\nAtmos Energy, on the other hand, is engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 0.9% over the past 60 days. ATO\u2019s expected earnings growth for the current year is 9%.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Under $10 Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Searching for under $10 stocks could be a great way to profit from potential rate cuts, U.S.-China trade tensions, and the upcoming presidential election.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s additional tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese imports, notably electric automobiles, once again heated the trade war between the two nations. On the other side of the aisle, Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has said he will impose a 60% or higher tariff on Chinese products if re-elected to office.\n\nIn addition, the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East mean one has to keep an eye on the energy sector, which is key to the future of global and U.S. trade. Because of these challenges, picking under $10 stocks is a good move, as they are light on the wallet and could lead to massive returns in 2024 if the Federal Reserve turns dovish. Thus, investors should keep an eye on the following three stocks for strong potential upside swings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nARC Document Solutions (ARC) A test page with various bright colors is shown printing from a wide format inkjet printer.\n\nSource: 3d_man / Shutterstock.com\n\nARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC), offering printing and document management services, is a no-frills performer among under $10 stocks. The company recently reported a 50% YOY increase in earnings-per-share (EPS) for Q1, 2024. This easily outpaced Wall Street estimates by 20%, indicating a strong comeback after the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down its momentum.\n\nFor ARC, digital color picture printing from new and returning customers earned $42.7 million. Meanwhile, scanning and digital picture sales reached $5.7 million as more clients shifted to digital. The firm\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment and material sales were also constrained to $3.8 million by high U.S. financing rates.\n\nARC forecasts high-demand services and artificial intelligence will improve scans and back-office tasks. The number of documents scanned and stored increased by 23% year-over-year in Q1, and this trend is likely to continue. ARC thinks that its focus on new business lines, such as color printing for trade shows, sports stadiums, and events, is paying off, even though sales of on-site print services and tools have dropped by 3%.\n\nLast year, ARC spent $12 million on shareholder returns. In 2024, it plans to give back 75% of its adjusted free cash flows to its owners.\n\nARC\u2019s forward dividend yield is 7.27%, more than the consumer discretionary industry average of 1.89%. The future payout ratio of this corporation is 65%, implying most earnings are distributed.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it. Stocks to Buy in March\n\nSource: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) started 2024 well financially, earning 10 cents per share, above the average expectation of six cents. Quarterly sales exceeded $987.95 million at $1.08 billion, beating projections by around 9%, helping the stock to a 36% bull run this year; despite this pricing increase, analysts still rate it a strong buy, based on 10 projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nKinross produced 527,399 gold equivalent ounces in Q1, 2024, 13% more than the same period last year. The cost of sales was $982 per ounce of gold, and the cost of maintaining the business as a whole was $1,310 per ounce of gold; profits went up by 20%, to $1,088 per ounce of gold sold.\n\nHigh efficiency and good profits were achieved at Kinross\u2019s three biggest mines: Tasiast, Paracatu, and La Coipa, which together produced 68% of the total. Tasiast and Paracatu made record quarterly output, which was a big part of the company\u2019s strong success.\n\nMeanwhile, the drilling operation for the Great Bear project continues to progress smoothly, and the Manh Choh project is still on track to start producing in early Q3, 2024. Also, the Tasiast solar power plant is now fully operating, which makes Kinross\u2019s processes more environmentally friendly.\n\nVaalco Energy (EGY) Illustration of oil pump jacks on sunset sky background to represent oil and gas stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY), is currently focused on energy exploration in West and North Africa and western Canada. It earned $7.7 million in Q1 2024, up from $3.4 million in 2023, while its quarterly revenues jumped 25% to $100.2 million from $80.4 million last year.\n\nIt produced 16,848 barrels of oil equivalent\u00a0per day in the first quarter of 2024, 8% less than in 2023. Moreover, Vaalco\u2019s cash-only acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration went successfully. The deal aims to improve output and business development. In the next quarters, the purchase should enhance Vaalco\u2019s production and profitability.\n\nThe company is also seeking ways to boost production and manufacturing efficiency in Egypt. Additionally, Vaalco is using its knowledge to improve operations and further develop its presence in the Canadian market.\n\nLastly, the company\u2019s 3.89% dividend yield places it among the top 30% of dividend yields. EGY\u2019s dividend payout ratio is 28%, which means there is plenty of room to grow the dividend, backed by profits, placing it well among under $10 stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

GOLD\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 20.2%.\n\nSimilarly, Kinross Gold holds major assets in Canada and the United States and is largely involved in the operation of gold mines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 48.5% over the past 60 days. KGC\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 11.4%.\n\nLike gold, a lower interest rate scenario bodes well for tech players and capital-intensive utility companies. Decreasing interest rates doesn\u2019t affect tech companies\u2019 future cash inflows, while the debt level decreases for utility companies, helping them pay off dues and register profits. Thus, low interest rates will work wonders for stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Atmos Energy Corporation ATO. These stocks currently flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA is a pioneer in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 1.8% over the past 60 days.

One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nDifferent than value or growth investors, momentum-oriented investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC)\n\nBased in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation is involved in the exploration and operation of gold mines. It ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the world, with a 2023 production of around 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces.

        "title": "The Dividend Investor\u2019s Dream: 3 Low-Priced Stocks With Huge Upside Potential",
        "content": "A lot of quality dividend stocks are unaffordable for small investors. For example, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) trades near $800. With limited funds, creating a well-diversified portfolio of high-priced stocks is impossible. Fortunately, the markets have low-priced dividend stocks to buy with an attractive outlook regarding dividend growth and capital gains. This column focuses on three ideas that can deliver robust returns in the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nAs an overview, precious metals, industrial commodities and energy are attractive asset classes to buy. Multiple rate cuts are in the cards for the next 12 to 18 months. This will translate into positive price action in these asset classes.\n\nUndervalued companies in these sectors are likely to benefit from higher realized prices. This will translate into revenue growth, EBITDA margin expansion and potential dividend growth. Backed by these positives, these undervalued dividend stocks to buy can also witness a strong rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGold has been surging and trades at $2,450 an ounce. With potential rate cuts likely in the year\u2019s second half, I expect the positive momentum for the precious metal to be sustained. Exposure to gold mining stocks is one way to benefit from gold price upside. Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) looks attractive among the low-priced bets.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that KGC stock has been in an uptrend with returns of 52% in the last 12 months. The stock, however, remains attractively valued at a forward P/E of 16.5 and offers a dividend yield of 1.5%. Considering the cash flow outlook on higher realized prices, I expect robust dividend growth.\n\nEarlier this month, Kinross reported Q1 2024 results. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $424.9 million. With gold trending higher, Kinross will likely deliver annual OCF close to $2 billion. Further, the company ended Q1 with a liquidity buffer of $2 billion.\n\nTherefore, with strong financial flexibility, I expect aggressive investments to boost production and benefit from higher realized prices. Kinross will likely pursue acquisitions to increase its visibility for production growth.\n\nBorr Drilling (BORR)\n\nSource: iStock\n\nCrude oil trades at $80 and has been subdued on macroeconomic headwinds. However, with the possibility of expansionary monetary policies, it\u2019s a good time to remain invested in the energy sector. Once oil trends are higher, the rally in quality energy stocks will likely be significant from undervalued levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR), an offshore shallow-water drilling contractor, is poised to surge higher. Further, BORR stock offers a dividend yield of 1.7%, and I expect healthy dividend growth in the next few years.\n\nThe first positive to note is that Borr ended 2023 with an order backlog of $1.75 billion. If oil trends increase, the order intake will remain strong and the revenue visibility robust.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Borr reported adjusted EBITDA of $351 million last year. The company has already guided for an adjusted EBITDA of $525 million for the current year. The potential upside in cash flows underscores my view on dividend growth.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVale (NYSE:VALE) stock is another name among dividend stocks to buy with high return potential. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 5.4 and offers a dividend yield of 8.46%.\n\nOne reason to be bullish on Vale is the upside in iron ore. The metal has climbed to a 3-month high on the back of China\u2019s stimulus to support the property sector. Potential rate cuts would be another catalyst in the coming quarters.\n\nSpecific to Vale, iron ore production for Q1 2024 was at the highest level since 2019. The company also reported healthy copper and nickel sales.\n\nWith the possibility of a higher realized price, Vale is positioned to deliver robust cash flows. For Q1 2024, the company reported free cash flow of $2 billion. It would not be a surprise if annual FCF is close to $10 billion. This provides ample flexibility for big investments and dividend growth. Considering the deep valuation gap, I also expect a sharp rally for VALE stock after an extended period of consolidation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Shares of Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. FSM scaled a new 52-week high of $5.44 on May 16, before ending the session slightly lower at $5.43. The appreciation was driven by rising gold and silver prices and strong first-quarter results.\r\n\r\nFSM has a market capitalization of $1.66 billion and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of Fortuna Silver have soared 91.2% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 62.1% growth. The S&P 500 has meanwhile moved up 6.4%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFortuna Silver\u2019s shares have gained 10% since it reported first-quarter results on May 7, 2024. Adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents marked an 80% improvement year over year. Revenues increased 28% year over year to $225 million, which was attributed to an increase in gold sales volumes and higher realized gold and silver prices.\n\nFortuna Silver produced 89,678 ounces of gold, 49% higher than the year-ago quarter while silver production plunged 32% to 1.07 million ounces. Gold equivalent production increased 19.6% year over year to 112,543 ounces. The improvement in gold sales volume was mainly attributed to the contribution of S\u00e9gu\u00e9la. The mine had been under construction in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFSM expects to produce gold in the range of 343-385 thousand ounces in 2024.

Gold equivalent ounces is expected at 457,000-497,000 ounces of gold equivalent ouncesa\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s shares have also benefited from the uptrend in gold and silver prices so far in 2024. Since the beginning of this year, gold prices have risen 15.3% while silver prices have surged 24.7%. Gold has remained consistently above the $2,000-per-ounce mark.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors have contributed to this upward trajectory, including increased geopolitical tensions, a depreciating U.S. dollar, the potential for monetary policy easing and continuous purchasing by central banks. Physical demand has also been strong in China of late since the weaker yuan, volatile stock market and comparatively low deposit rates have led investors to explore alternatives for their savings. Gold is currently at $2,385 an ounce boosted by expectations of interest rate cuts fueled by cooling U.S. inflation date. Silver prices are at $29.71 per ounce.\r\n\r\nOther mining companies have also benefited from these trends as well as their upbeat Q1 performances and are currently trading near their 52-week highs.\r\n\r\nAvino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd. ASM shares have gained 88.7% in the past three months and closed at $0.90 on May 17, near its 52-week high of $0.92.\r\n\r\nThe company recently reported earnings per share of 2 cents for the first quarter, which marked a 100% year-over-year improvement attributed to higher gold prices and lower costs. Avino Silver\u2019s revenues rose 26% year over year to $12.4 million, owing to higher gold and silver prices.\r\n\r\nMAG Silver Corp. MAG shares have gained 53.3% in the past three months and closed at $13.38 on May 17, near its 52-week high of $13.47.\r\n\r\nMAG reported adjusted earnings per share of 14 cents for first-quarter 2024 on May 14.

        "content": "Budget conscious investors and people with not a lot of capital need not worry. There are plenty of low priced stocks available to buy that have the potential for exponential growth. A lot of analysts give their highest ratings to under-$10 stocks. Many penny stocks, which are securities trading for under $5 a share, also have top marks from analysts despite their low price.\n\nFinding cheaply priced and attractively valued stocks of well-run companies can be the key to an investor\u2019s long-term success. Often times, it is these stocks that have the most growth potential and earn the biggest returns over the long run. The analysts ratings placed on these stocks can help investors determine if they are worth an allocation of capital and the right price at which to take a position.\n\nHere is Wall Street favorites: Three under-$10 stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnder-$10 Stocks: TeraWulf (WULF) Dinosaur figurine holding a Bitcoin (BTC) concept coin between its teeth\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Maestro-0111\n\nTeraWulf (NASDAQ:WULF) might be familiar to cryptocurrency bulls. The company is an environmentally friendlyBitcoin (BTC-USD) miner that says its aim is to accelerate \u201cthe transition to a zero-carbon future.\u201d Currently, TeraWulf trades right around $2 per share, making it a penny stock. Over the last 12 months, WULF stock has risen 24%. However, the share price today is 74% lower than where it traded five years ago.\n\nDespite its penny stock status and uneven performance, six Wall Street analysts rate WULF stock a strong buy. The median price target on the shares is $3.62, implying nearly 80% upside from current levels. Clearly, analysts like that TeraWulf is focused on responsible Bitcoin mining and making the process better for the environment. One of the biggest knocks on crypto miners is that they consume an excessive amounts of power.\n\nKinross Gold Corp. (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) is another stock under $10 that analysts rate highly. Currently trading at just under $8 per share, Kinross has been riding the bull rally in gold\u2019s price to new heights. KGC stock has increased nearly 50% in the past 12 months, including a 32% gain this year. Analysts see more growth ahead for the Canadian gold miner, especially as the price of bullion marches higher.\n\nA total of 10 Wall Street analysts rate KGC stock a strong buy with a median price target that is 6% above current levels. That\u2019s impressive coming after a big rally in the stock price. Kinross has been doing its best to make hay while the sun shines, and as the price of gold hit an all-time high of $2,431.55 an ounce in April of this year. While gold\u2019s price has pulled back a bit in recent weeks, its price is still trading close to the $2,400.00 mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nKosmos Energy (KOS) A Koss Porta Pro headset in a box.\n\nSource: SiljeAO / Shutterstock.com\n\nKosmos Energy (NYSE:KOS) is an upstream oil company based in Dallas, Texas. Among oil concerns, Kosmos is pretty small. KOS stock currently trades at less than $6 a share, giving the company a market capitalization of less than $3 billion. The stock hasn\u2019t been setting the world on fire lately. Year to date, the share price is down 13%. Over five years, the stock is down 9%. Yet analysts remain bullish on this oil producer.\n\nCurrently, six Wall Street analysts rate KOS stock a strong buy and have a median price target of $8.12, which is 38% above where the shares are changing hands at present. Analysts seems to like the opportunity Kosmos Energy has with the development of several mine sites around the world, including in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and the Gulf of Mexico.

        "content": "If you are a bargain hunter like me, you will always be on the lookout for stocks to buy at a lower price and make the most of their upside.\n\nWhile all under-$10 stocks may not be worth your money,\u00a0a few stocks\u00a0have the potential to hit double digits. But, they may be trading below $10 due to several macroeconomic factors.\u00a0These stocks are solid buy-and-hold and could double your money if you have the patience. Once the economy improves and a rate cut materializes, you might not get an opportunity to buy these stocks below $10.\n\nIf you are\u00a0on the lookout\u00a0for stocks under $10 and want solid companies to invest in, here are my three picks. These are industry stalwarts with\u00a0strong\u00a0fundamentals, impressive annual earnings guidance and the potential to double your money. Let\u2019s dive into them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi logo sign on headquarters facade. Social Finance is an online personal finance company.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech company SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI)\u00a0could become a multi-bagger in the next five years.\u00a0Trading at $7.49 today, the stock is down 26% year-to-date (YTD). In fact, it hasn\u2019t been able to touch double digits since the beginning of the year. Despite reporting impressive fundamentals in the last two quarters and raising the annual earnings guidance, the stock hasn\u2019t been able to pick up pace.\n\nIn the\u00a0recent earnings report, the net sales stood at $581 million, up 26% year-over-year (YOY), and the financial services segment saw a 33% jump.\u00a0It has seen a strong top line\u00a0despite the concerns about high interest rates.\u00a0The financial services segment reported net sales of $151 million. Also, the tech platform reported net sales of $91 million, up 21% YOY.\n\nSince SoFi Technologies relies on lending, this is a concern when it comes to the current macroeconomic environment. Investors are worried about defaults in the long term. However, the management is taking a conservative approach and has said that the lending segment revenue will drop 5% to 8% from the past year.\n\nAs revenue from the other segments\u00a0continue to grow, SOFI will see a solid improvement in the top and bottom lines. The company reported its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter and has been attracting new users at a steady rate. It ended the first quarter with 8.1 million users. For the past two quarters, it has seen a 44% jump in member growth.\n\nThus, SoFi\u00a0Technologies is set\u00a0to have a transitional year ahead\u00a0and\u00a0a rate cut could boost its business.\u00a0The long-term picture looks\u00a0highly attractive\u00a0and\u00a0this is one stock that\u00a0can double your money by 2025.\u00a0Buying SOFI stock under $10 is a smart move.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmidst several reasons to bet on Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC),\u00a0you will need patience.\n\nExchanging hands for $4.50 today, the stock has lost 30%\u00a0value\u00a0since the beginning of the year. It is trading much lower than the 52-week high of $23.\u00a0But, expect strong upside potential once the Thacker Pass project commences. It is the largest lithium project in history,\u00a0and\u00a0the company aims to achieve\u00a0full\u00a0production by 2028.\n\nAs the electric vehicle (EV) industry recovers, the demand for lithium will be on the rise. So this becomes the key moment for Lithium Americas to strike. The construction of the project began last year. It has a mine life of 40 years and an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Besides Thacker Pass, Lithium Americas has received a $650 million investment from General Motors (NYSE:GM) for the Thacker Pass mine.\n\nAlso, the company has received a $2.26 billion loan from the\u00a0U.S. Department of Energy to help finance the construction of a Nevada processing plant. LAC stock\u00a0is beaten down\u00a0today. But\u00a0it\u00a0owns the hottest asset right now\u00a0and\u00a0the long-term picture looks attractive.\n\nIf you\u00a0have the patience to\u00a0hold the stock until the Thacker Pass Project commences production, this is one stock to buy and hold. The dip is the perfect time to load up on the stock\u00a0which\u00a0can double your money.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpect gold mining companies to report stellar quarterly numbers driven by the high gold prices.\u00a0Gold has been hitting all-time highs. So companies like Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) are set\u00a0to hit the jackpot.\n\nRecently, the gold miner\u00a0reported results\u00a0and beat expectations. It reported a revenue of $1.08 billion, and the EPS stood at 10 cents.\u00a0The company saw a 23% YOY increase in\u00a0the\u00a0production\u00a0of gold,\u00a0and\u00a0the operating income came in at $259 million.\n\nIt ended March with a cash balance of $471.0 million.\u00a0Many anticipate gold prices\u00a0to\u00a0continue the upward rally,\u00a0and\u00a0this\u00a0will benefit Kinross significantly.\u00a0Trading at $7.59, KGC stock is up 28% YTD and 40% in the last 12 months. Also, it has a dividend yield of 1.58%. Considering the liquidity, the company\u00a0has the potential to\u00a0increase dividends in the coming years.\n\nFinally, Kinross Gold Corporation expects the gold production to hit 2.1 million ounces\u00a0in the year. Scotiabank has a price target of $8 for the stock with a buy rating,\u00a0while\u00a0Cormark has a market outperform rating,\u00a0and\u00a0National Bank has a buy rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Inflation has been stubborn, and the inflation rate can be higher for families based on their consumption basket. Therefore, money in the savings account is likely to erode in purchasing power. Investing in relatively risky asset classes is the only way to maintain or increase purchasing power.\n\nWithin equities, blue-chip stocks have a low beta and provide steady returns. However, it\u2019s important to consider exposure to high-beta stocks to boost portfolio returns. This column focuses on high-risk high-reward stocks under $10 that can 2x in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s important to limit exposure to the high-risk stocks. However, even with 10% to 15% portfolio exposure, the overall impact on portfolio returns can be significant. While talking about speculative plays, I have ensured that the ideas discussed represent companies with good fundamentals. These stocks are likely to surge higher with impending company or industry-specific catalysts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons for being positive about these high-risk, high-reward stocks under $10.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) has been in an uptrend for year-to-date. However, valuations remain attractive, with KGC stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.4. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 1.69%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that gold trades above $2,300 an ounce. Further, gold is expected to hit $2,600 an ounce in the next 12 months. If this projection holds, KGC stock will likely go ballistic in the next few quarters.\n\nI must mention that the bullish momentum is already underway, with Kinross reporting stellar Q1 2024 results. For the quarter, production growth was 13% on a year-on-year basis to 527,399 ounces. Further, adjusted operating cash flow was $425 million. With gold in an uptrend, the annual adjusted OCF will likely be close to $2 billion.\n\nKinross ended the quarter with a strong liquidity buffer of $2 billion. This provides ample flexibility for aggressive capital investments and potential acquisitions to boost production.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) stock has declined sharply year to date. However, on a 12-month basis, the stock returns are stellar at 90%. I believe that the recent correction is a good buying opportunity. I will not be surprised if ACHR stock trades double-digits in the next few quarters.\n\nAs an overview, Archer is moving towards the commercialization of flying cars. Archer will likely commence operations in the United States in 2025. Additionally, the Company will likely commercialize eVTOL aircraft in the UAE next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nArcher recently signed a framework agreement in Abu Dhabi to accelerate commercial air taxi operations across the UAE. With plans to commence operations in India by 2026, Archer seems to have aggressive growth plans. I expect stellar revenue growth in the next few years as the Company makes inroads into new markets.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that Archer is focused on significantly scaling up operations. The manufacturing facility in Georgia is likely to support the production of 650 aircraft annually. This will support servicing an indicative order backlog of $3.5 billion.\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter some corrections, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) witnessed a renewed rally. It was entirely likely after the halving event. I expect the digital asset to scale new highs in the coming months. A good proxy exposure to Bitcoin is investing in quality miners. Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) look attractive at around $2 levels for multibagger returns within the next 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Bitfarms ended April with a mining capacity of 7EH/s. The Company is targeting to boost capacity to 21EH/s by the end of the year. This is likely to translate into stellar revenue and EBITDA growth. An important point is that Bitfarms reported an average cost per Bitcoin production of $16,200 as of Q4 2023. Being a low-cost miner, Bitfarms is positioned to deliver robust cash flows.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Bitfarms has a zero-debt balance sheet and ended 2023 with a liquidity buffer of $118 million. With the $375 million at-the-market equity offering program in March, Bitfarms is well positioned to finance its aggressive expansion plans.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 8, 2024\n\nKinross Gold Corporation isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Shannon, I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kinross Gold First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn, the conference over to Chris Lichtenheldt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Lichtenheldt: Thank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, CEO, and from the Kinross Senior Leadership Team, Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, William Dunford, and Geoff Gold. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to page two of this presentation. Our news release dated May 7, 2024. The MD&A for the period ended March 31, 2024, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Rollinson: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results, provide high-level updates across our portfolio, highlight some of our ESG achievements, and confirm our outlook. I will then hand the call over to Andrea, Claude, and Will to provide more detail. Following our strong performance in 2023, our operations continue to perform very well, and we are generating significant cash flow. The strong gold price is far this year are providing a tailwind for our business, which continues to be underpinned by a focus on cost discipline, and margins. Our production in the first quarter was on-plan, delivering 527,000 ounces. Tasiast, Paracatu, and La Coipa contributed just over two-thirds of our production at strong margins, with an ASIC below $1,000 per ounce.\n\nOur U.S. operations also performed well in the first quarter, delivering on-plan and remain on track for their full-year targets. Turning now to our development activities in the first quarter. At Round Mountain, the Life of Mine Extension Strategy that we announced last year is advancing well. We are making significant progress at Phase S and with our underground opportunities at Phase X and Gold Hill. I was recently at Round Mountain and was very impressed by the progress at Phase X where we have completed approximately 1.8 kilometers of underground development. In Alaska, the Manh Choh project is proceeding well and is on schedule to contribute to production in early Q3. Transportation of ore to Fort Knox continues to ramp up, and the mill modifications remain on track.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Great Bear, we continue to make excellent progress across several work streams. We had a highly productive few months with nearly 38,000 meters of drilling completed. As outlined in yesterday's press release, drilling continues to return significant results extending beyond our year-end resource update. In addition to drilling, other areas of the project such as permitting and engineering for the advanced exploration decline are progressing well as our technical studies permitting and engineering work on the main project. We are on track to release our results from the ongoing work in the form of a PEA in the second-half of the year. I want to provide some additional context around the level of study we plan to release. The PEA will provide a more fulsome view of the project, including both the open pit and underground resource.\n\nPublishing a PEA allows us to include some of the underground inferred resources. This will provide better visibility into our anticipated path forward for both underground and open pit mining. While it will be a PEA level study, we are putting substantial effort into our capital and operating cost estimates to provide additional confidence on the ASIC and margins. It is also important to note that our PEA will incorporate a subset of the ounces in our measure indicated and inferred resources. It will not include the deeper mineralization that we will not yet have drilled sufficiently to bring into the inferred resources. Our deep drilling has shown that the mineralization continues to depth well below the current resource in attractive woods and grades.\n\nAs we continue drilling out the underground and commence underground drilling from the AEX decline, we expect the ounces in the mine plan to continue to grow. On permitting for the main project, the detailed project description was submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada in Q1. The federal impact assessment is underway and We expect to file our impact statement in the first-half of next year. Turning to sustainability. Our longstanding annual sustainability report will be published later this month. This report, which is in its 16th edition, will provide a comprehensive update on the progress we made in 2023 and what we aim to accomplish this year and beyond. Turning to our outlook, following a strong first quarter, we are on track to achieve our 2.1 million ounce of production and our cost guidance for this year.\n\nIn light, of the recent strong gold prices, we will continue to maintain our financial discipline and prioritize margins. With respect to capital allocation, our plan is to use excess cashflow to repay debt. Our first quarter is setting up 2024 to be another strong year. We believe that delivering on our guidance, coupled with our strong free cash flow, should continue to support strong share price performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Freeborough: Thanks, Paul. This morning, I will review our financial highlights from the quarter, provide an overview of our balance sheet, and comment on our guidance and outlook. As Paul noted, we had a strong start to the year. We produced 527,000 ounces with gold sales of 522,000 ounces. We held our cost of sales in line with the prior quarter at $982 per ounce. With an average realized gold price of $2,070 per ounce, we delivered strong margins of $1,088 per ounce. ASIC of $1,310 per ounce was slightly lower, compared to the prior quarter on comparable cost of sales and lower sustaining capital. Average realized gold prices in Q1 have been notably higher, driving strong ongoing margins and free cash flow. In Q1 our adjusted earnings were $0.10 per share and adjusted operating cash flow was $425 million.\n\nWe generated a $145 million of attributable free cash flow in Q1 or $194 million excluding changes in working capital. Turning to the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong. We ended the quarter with $407 million in cash and approximately $2 billion of total liquidity. Our trailing 12-month net debt to EBITDA ratio also improved as a quarter end to just below 1 tonne. At current gold prices, we expect our debt metrics to continue to improve throughout the year. As Paul mentioned, we plan to allocate excess free cash against the term loan due in 2025 and expect to start debt repayments this quarter. Turning to our guidance, following Q1, we remain solidly on track to meet our guidance and produce 2.1 million ounces at a cost of sales of $1,020 per ounce and ASIC of $1,360 per ounce.\n\nCapital expenditures are on track for our full-year guidance of $1.05 billion, split roughly evenly between sustaining and non-sustaining capital. Cash flow is expected to be stronger in the second-half as a result of timing of tax payments made earlier in the year. I'll now turn the call over to Claude. Aerial shot of a mine entrance, the bedrock of the company's gold and silver extraction.\n\nClaude Schimper: Thank you, Andrea. We have achieved significant progress with the implementation of our Safety Excellence Program, which reached over 50% of employees and business partners globally. This year as part of our health and safety blueprint we are taking additional steps to further improve engagement across the global team with a focus on human and organizational performance and operational learning teams. We will continue rolling out this program globally and look forward to providing further updates over the coming quarters. Moving to our operations, we saw a strong performance in Q1 with our mines delivering the planned production for the quarter. At Tasiast production of 159,000 ounces was in line with the prior quarter with a cost of sales of $660 per ounce being the lowest in the portfolio.\n\nAt the Tasiast solar plant, commissioning is now complete and the plant is generating power to full capacity. Tasiast\u2019s remains on track to meet its 2024 production guidance of 610,000 ounces. The Paracatu, production of 128,000 ounces, at a cost of sales of $1,059 per ounce, were both in line with the prior quarter. Production at Paracatu this year is expected to be lower and costs higher, compared to last year as mine sequencing continues to transition through the lower grade portions of the fixed before moving back into higher grades next year. Paracatu remains on track to meet its 2024 production guidance of 510,000 ounces. At La Coipa, Q1 production of 71,000 ounces was on plan. The mine delivered strong free cash flow driven by high margin production from a cost of sales of $733 per ounce, the second lowest in our portfolio.\n\nProduction is tracking well against our plants, a strong performance on grades and recoveries offset lower throughput. In light of strong current grades and recoveries, we took the opportunity to perform maintenance to improve the long-term reliability of the mill, while maintaining our production target of 250,000 ounces. At our U.S. operations, the first quarter performance was on the plan. The total production of 169,000 ounces at a cost of sales of $1,312 per ounce. Beginning with Fort Knox, in part due to a significant weather event in Alaska at the beginning of the year, Q1 production of 53,000 ounces was lower quarter-over-quarter, due to lower mill throughput, grade and recoveries, and lower ounces recovered from the heap leach pads.\n\nCost of sales of $1,466 per ounce was higher over the prior quarter, primarily due to the lower production. At Manh Choh, mining activities including ore mining and stockpiling have commenced and transportation of the ore to Fort Knox continues to ramp up. At Fort Knox, mill modifications and site preparation is progressing on plan. First production for Manh Choh is on track for early Q3. At Gold Mountain, production of 47,000 ounces improved over the prior quarter, driven by higher ounces recovered from the past. Cost of sales of $1,103 per ounce was lower quarter-over-quarter on higher production and a higher proportion of capitalized development. At Round Mountain, production of 68,000 ounces was higher quarter-over-quarter and stronger mill grade throughput and recoveries.\n\nCost of sales of $1,329 per ounce improved over the prior quarter on higher production and a higher proportion of capitalized mining activity related to the ongoing stripping at Phase S. Also at Phase S, procurement and construction activities for the heap leach pads expansion remain on track and first production remains on schedule to beginning in the second-half of next year. With that, I'll now pass the call over to William.\n\nWilliam Dunford: Thanks, Claude. I'll start by continuing on Round Mountain and then provide a few updates on progress at Curlew and Great Bear. At Round Mountain Phase X, as Paul mentioned, the underground decline has progressed well with over 1,800 meters developed thus far. Decline has now reached the point where we can begin drilling off the target mineralization from underground and we will be doing so in Q2. As we progressed the decline in Q1, we took the opportunity to drill in between the open pit and the underground target. As you can see on the slide, this drilling hit multiple higher grade intercepts, including 9.9 grams per ton over 21 meters and 16.6 grams per ton over 8 meters in an area where we had not previously modelled mineralization.\n\nWe remain excited by the potential for higher margin production from the underground of Phase X and are pleased to see these higher grade drill results supporting that potential. We look forward to updating you with additional drill results from the main target later this year. At Gold Hill we are progressing infill drilling of the underground targets from the bottom of the open pit, and we are also continuing surface exploration, targeting extensions at depth and along strike. Moving to Curlew Basin, underground drilling continued at the recently discovered Roadrunner vein zone. Multiple zones of stockwork veins were intersected, while testing strike and dip extents over a broad area. Assays from this drilling are still pending. Team has also been working on optimizing the potential mine designs to improve margins and we are encouraged by the results to-date.\n\nAs Paul mentioned, we had a very productive first quarter of drilling at Great Bear, completing approximately 38 of the planned 120 kilometers of drilling budgeted for the full-year. Our drilling at Great Bear continues to focus on the finding zones of inferred mineralization at greater depths at LP Central, Discovery and Viggo. In Q1, we saw further high grade intercepts around 1,000 meters vertical depth at Yuma, building on the resource we already have in that area, including 18.6 grams per ton over 10 meters. Our drilling also showed good grades and widths at depths well beyond our current resource at Discovery, Yaro, and Oro, as you can see on the slide. These zones continue to grow at depth, similar to what we saw with resource growth through deeper drilling at Yuma.\n\nAlthough the PEA will be limited to [MINI] (ph) resources, this drilling continues to demonstrate our thesis that this orogenic deposit extends at significant depths with strong continuity, providing the potential for a long life, high grade mining complex. As with many underground, the long-term potential will become more visible as we progress deeper with development to provide efficient drill access to the deeper mineralization, which is why we are now focused on progressing AEX. As a reminder, we are advancing Great Bear across two key project streams, the AEX underground decline through which we plan to obtain a bulk sample and perform definition drilling and infill-drilling. And the main project, which includes the mine, mill and related infrastructure required for production.\n\nFor the AEX decline subject to receipt of permits, we are targeting a start of the surface construction in the second-half of the year and start of the underground decline in mid-2025. Detailed engineering, execution planning, and procurement for AEX continue to progress well. Infrastructure such as the camp and water treatment plant has now been purchased and we are planning to contract major civil works in Q2. For the main project, we continue to advance technical studies, field work, and comprehensive baseline studies. Work on the PEA is progressing well and we look forward to releasing it in the second-half of 2024. In Q1, we also conducted substantial geotechnical work to help inform project studies and to de-risk the project builds. We look forward to continuing to provide updates as we progress all work streams towards advancing AEX in the main project.\n\nI\u2019ll now turn it back to Paul.\n\nPaul Rollinson: Thanks, Will. Our business is off to a strong start this year. There's plenty to look forward to this year and beyond that, we remain excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant cash flow. We have an investment grade balance sheet. We have a competitive dividend. We have an exciting pipeline of exploration and development opportunities. And we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues to make us a leader in ESG performance. With that operator, I'd like to open up the line for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n20 Best Long-lasting Lipsticks and\n\n12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Kinross Gold Corporation Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "A week ago, Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K) came out with a strong set of first-quarter numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$1.1b, some 4.2% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$0.09, 23% ahead of expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Kinross Gold  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing the latest results, Kinross Gold's nine analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$4.52b in 2024. This would be an okay 2.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to shrink 9.2% to US$0.32 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.38b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.33 in 2024. Overall it looks as though the analysts were a bit mixed on the latest results. Although there was a an okay to revenue, the consensus also made a small dip in its earnings per share forecasts.\n\nThere's been no major changes to the price target of CA$11.05, suggesting that the impact of higher forecast revenue and lower earnings won't result in a meaningful change to the business' valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Kinross Gold analyst has a price target of CA$13.76 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at CA$7.73. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting Kinross Gold's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 3.9% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.9% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to see revenue growth of 12% annually. It seems obvious that, while the future growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, Kinross Gold is expected to grow slower than the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for next year, even though it is expected to grow slower than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at CA$11.05, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Kinross Gold analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nDon't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Kinross Gold (1 is concerning)  you should be aware of.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Kinross Gold (KGC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.10 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.06 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 66.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this gold mining company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.11, delivering a surprise of 22.22%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nKinross Gold , which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, posted revenues of $1.08 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.34%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $929.3 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nKinross Gold shares have added about 11.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Kinross Gold?\n\nWhile Kinross Gold has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kinross Gold: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.08 on $1.02 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.40 on $4.26 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Mining - Gold is currently in the top 13% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector, Hawkins (HWKN), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 15.\n\nThis chemical maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nHawkins' revenues are expected to be $217.49 million, down 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Kinross Gold Corporation\n\nStrong start to the year with robust margins driving strong free cash flow\r\nDevelopment projects on track\r\nWell positioned to meet annual guidance\n\nTORONTO, May 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC) (\u201cKinross\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking information about expected future events and financial and operating performance of the Company. We refer to the risks and assumptions set out in our Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information located on pages 27 and 28 of this release. All dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.\n\n2024 first-quarter highlights:\n\nProduction of 527,399 gold equivalent ounces (Au eq. oz.), a 13% year-over-year increase. Production cost of sales1,2 of $982 per Au eq. oz. sold and all-in sustaining cost2, 3 of $1,310 per Au eq. oz. sold, both of which are in line with Q1 2023. Margins4 increased by 20% to $1,088 per Au eq. oz. sold, outpacing the rise in the average realized gold price. Operating cash flow5 of $374.4 million and adjusted operating cash flow3 of $424.9 million. Attributable6 free cash flow3 of $145.3 million. Reported net earnings7 of $107.0 million, or $0.09 per share, with adjusted net earnings3,8 of $124.9 million, or $0.10 per share3. Kinross\u2019 Board of Directors declared a quarterly\u00a0dividend of $0.03 per common share\u00a0payable on June 13, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2024. On track to meet annual guidance: On an attributable basis6, Kinross expects to produce 2.1 million Au eq. oz. (+/- 5%) at a production cost of sales per Au eq. oz.1 of $1,020 (+/- 5%) and all-in sustaining cost3 of $1,360 (+/- 5%) per ounce sold for 2024. Total attributable6 capital expenditures3 are forecast to be approximately $1,050 million (+/- 5%). Balance sheet strength: Kinross has improved its debt metrics and continues to maintain its investment grade credit ratings. As of March 31, 2024, Kinross had cash and cash equivalents of $406.9 million, for total liquidity9 of approximately $2 billion. Operations:\n\nKinross\u2019 three largest producing mines \u2013 Tasiast, Paracatu and La Coipa \u2013 delivered 68% of total production, with production cost of sales of $821 per Au eq. oz. sold1 and margins4 of $1,251 per Au eq. oz. sold. Tasiast achieved record quarterly throughput as the mine continued its strong performance since the completion of the 24k project. Paracatu achieved record quarterly throughput and La Coipa continued to deliver high margin production.  Development projects:\n\nKinross\u2019 pipeline of development projects continues to advance on plan. At Great Bear, the drilling campaign made strong progress in Q1 2024 and continues to successfully target extensions of the resource at depth. At Manh Choh, operations are ramping up and the project is on track for first production in early Q3 2024. At Round Mountain, Phase S mining is on plan, and the exploration decline at Phase X is progressing well, with approximately 1,800 metres developed to date. Sustainability Report: Kinross expects to publish its 2023 Sustainability Report later this month, providing a comprehensive summary of its performance over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO commentary:\r\nJ. Paul Rollinson, CEO, made the following comments in relation to 2024 first-quarter results:\n\n\u201cWe have had a strong start to the year and are well positioned to meet our annual guidance. Our portfolio of mines performed well, driven by strong operational performance, disciplined cost management and higher gold prices. The Company delivered a 20% increase in margins to $1,088 per ounce sold, which is approximately double the percentage increase in the gold price over the same period. As a result, free cash flow more than tripled over Q1 2023.\n\n\u201cWith the strong sustained gold price, we will continue to prioritize our financial discipline and operational excellence. We will focus on maintaining our margins and cost profile, prudent capital allocation and debt reduction.\n\n\u201cOur development projects are all proceeding as planned. At Great Bear, we made excellent progress on our 2024 drilling campaign, which continued to successfully target extensions of the resource at depth, and we remain on track to release a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) in the second half of the year. At Round Mountain, Phase S and Phase X are advancing well. We are also looking forward to first production at Manh Choh early in the third quarter. At Tasiast, our solar power plant is complete and generating power at full capacity.\n\n\u201cKinross\u2019 commitment to Sustainability is deeply rooted in our values and culture, and we are proud of our consistent high rankings in our industry. We are looking forward to publishing our 2023 Sustainability Report later this month, marking our 16th year of reporting in this important area.\u201d\n\nSummary of financial and operating results\n\nThree months ended March 31, (unaudited, in millions of U.S. dollars, except ounces, per share amounts, and per ounce amounts) 2024 2023 Operating Highlights Total gold equivalent ounces(a) Produced 527,399 466,022 Sold 522,400 490,330 Financial Highlights Metal sales $ 1,081.5 $ 929.3 Production cost of sales $ 512.9 $ 483.9 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 270.7 $ 211.9 Operating earnings $ 193.2 $ 143.9 Net earnings attributable to common shareholders $ 107.0 $ 90.2 Basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders $ 0.09 $ 0.07 Diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders $ 0.09 $ 0.07 Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders(b) $ 124.9 $ 87.6 Adjusted net earnings per share(b) $ 0.10 $ 0.07 Net cash flow provided from operating activities $ 374.4 $ 259.0 Adjusted operating cash flow(b) $ 424.9 $ 358.2 Capital expenditures(c) $ 241.9 $ 221.2 Attributable(d)capital expenditures(b) $ 232.1 $ 211.8 Attributable(d)free cash flow(b) $ 145.3 $ 47.8 Average realized gold price per ounce(e) $ 2,070 $ 1,894 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce(a)sold(f)(g) $ 982 $ 987 Production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis(b)(g) $ 941 $ 929 All-in sustaining cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis(b)(g) $ 1,281 $ 1,284 All-in sustaining cost per equivalent ounce(a)sold(b)(g) $ 1,310 $ 1,321 Attributable(d)all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis(b) $ 1,613 $ 1,616 Attributable(d)all-in cost per equivalent ounce(a)sold(b) $ 1,630 $ 1,634\n\n(a) \u201cGold equivalent ounces\u201d include silver ounces produced and sold converted to a gold equivalent based on a ratio of the average spot market prices for the commodities for each period. The ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was 88.70:1 (first quarter of 2023 \u2013 83.82:1). (b) The definition and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios is included on pages 16 to 21 of this news release. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios have no standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. (c) \u201cCapital expenditures\u201d is as reported as \u201cAdditions to property, plant and equipment\u201d on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. (d) \u201cAttributable\u201d includes Kinross\u2019 70% share of Manh Choh costs, capital expenditures and cash flow, as appropriate. (e) \u201cAverage realized gold price per ounce\u201d is defined as gold metal sales divided by total gold ounces sold. (f) \u201cProduction cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold. (g) As production from Manh Choh is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2024, production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios for Manh Choh are nil for all periods presented. As a result, production cost of sales and all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios are equal to attributable production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios, as applicable.\n\nThe following operating and financial results are based on first-quarter gold equivalent production:\n\nProduction: Kinross produced 527,399 Au eq. oz. in Q1 2024, compared with 466,022 Au eq. oz. in Q1 2023. The 13% year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher throughput at Tasiast, higher grades at La Coipa, and higher production at Bald Mountain due to timing of ounces recovered from the heap leach pads.\n\nAverage realized gold price10: The average realized gold price in Q1 2024 was $2,070 per ounce, compared with $1,894 per ounce in Q1 2023.\n\nRevenue: During the first quarter, revenue increased to $1,081.5 million, compared with $929.3 million during Q1 2023. The 16% year-over-year increase is primarily due to increases in gold equivalent ounces sold and average metal prices realized.\n\nProduction cost of sales: Production cost of sales per Au eq. oz. sold1, 2 decreased slightly to $982 for the quarter, compared with $987 in Q1 2023.\n\nProduction cost of sales per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis2,3 was $941 in Q1 2024, compared with $929\u00a0in Q1 2023, based on gold sales of 503,604 ounces and silver sales of 1,667,248 ounces.\n\nMargins4: Kinross\u2019 margin per Au eq. oz. sold increased by 20% to $1,088 for Q1 2024, compared with the Q1 2023 margin of $907, outpacing the 9% increase in average realized gold price10.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost2, 3: All-in sustaining cost per Au eq. oz. sold was $1,310 in Q1 2024, compared with $1,321 in Q1 2023.\n\nIn Q1 2024, all-in sustaining cost per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis was $1,281, compared with $1,284 in Q1 2023.\n\nOperating cash flow5: Operating cash flow was $374.4 million for Q1 2024, compared with $259.0 million for Q1 2023.\n\nAdjusted operating cash flow3 for Q1 2024 was $424.9 million, compared with $358.2 million for Q1 2023.\n\nAttributable6 free cash flow3: Attributable free cash flow more than tripled to $145.3 million in Q1 2024, compared with $47.8 million in Q1 2023.\n\nEarnings: Reported net earnings7 increased by 19% to $107.0 million for Q1 2024, or $0.09 per share, compared with reported net earnings of $90.2 million, or $0.07 per share, for Q1 2023.\n\nAdjusted net earnings3, 8 increased by 43% to $124.9 million, or $0.10 per share, for Q1 2024, compared with $87.6 million, or $0.07 per share, for Q1 2023.\n\nAttributable6 capital expenditures3: Attributable capital expenditures increased to $232.1 million for Q1 2024, compared with $211.8 million for Q1 2023, primarily due to an increase in capital stripping at Tasiast and Fort Knox11, as well as the start of Phase S capital development at Round Mountain, partially offset by a decrease in capital stripping at La Coipa.\n\nBalance sheet\n\nKinross had cash and cash equivalents of $406.9 million as of March 31, 2024, compared with $352.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in operating cash flow.\n\nKinross has improved its debt metrics and continues to prioritize maintaining and strengthening its investment grade balance sheet. Kinross plans to further reduce debt during the year by allocating excess free cash generated towards the term loan due in 2025.\n\nThe Company had additional available credit12 of $1.6 billion and total liquidity9 of approximately $2 billion as of March 31, 2024.\n\nDividend\n\nAs part of its continuing quarterly dividend program, the Company declared a dividend of $0.03 per common share payable on June 13, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 30, 2024.\n\nOperating results\n\nMine-by-mine summaries for 2024 first-quarter operating results may be found on pages 10 and 14 of this news release. Highlights include the following:\n\nAt Tasiast, production was in line with the previous quarter, and was higher year-over-year mainly due to record quarterly throughput following the completion of the Tasiast 24k project in the second half of 2023, partly offset by lower grades, as planned. Cost of sales per ounce sold was largely in line quarter-over-quarter, and lower year-over-year mainly due to the higher ounces sold.\n\nParacatu delivered according to plan, with production largely in line with the previous quarter, and higher year-over-year mainly due to an increase in throughput, partly offset by lower grades as a result of planned mine sequencing. Cost of sales per ounce sold decreased quarter-over-quarter primarily due to lower maintenance, labour and contractor costs. Year-over-year, cost of sales per ounce sold increased mainly due to an increase in labour, drilling, blasting and fuel costs related to an increase in tonnes mined.\n\nAt La Coipa, production was slightly lower than the previous quarter mainly as a result of a decrease in throughput, which was offset by higher grades and recoveries. Production increased compared with the same period last year primarily due to an increase in gold grades, and an increase in mill throughput. Cost of sales per ounce sold was largely in line with both comparable periods.\n\nAt Fort Knox11, production was lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower mill grade, throughput and recovery, and the seasonal effect of fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. Year-over-year, production was lower due to lower mill grade, throughput and recovery. In both comparable periods, cost of sales per ounce sold was higher primarily due to lower production.\n\nRound Mountain performed well, with production increasing quarter-over-quarter due to higher mill throughput, grade, and recoveries, partially offset by fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. The increase in production compared to Q1 2023 was primarily due to higher mill grade and throughput, partially offset by lower mill recovery and fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. In both comparable periods, cost of sales per ounce sold was lower due to the increase in production as well as an increase in capital development related to the start of stripping Phase S.\n\nAt Bald Mountain, production increased in both comparable periods mainly due to an increase in ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. Cost of sales per ounce sold was lower quarter-over-quarter mainly as a result of a higher proportion of capital development, and similarly, lower year-over-year due to a higher proportion of capital development as well as higher production.\n\nDevelopment Projects and Exploration\n\nGreat Bear\n\nAt the Great Bear project, the Company\u2019s robust exploration program continues to make excellent progress, execution planning for the advanced exploration program is well underway, and permitting continues to advance on plan.\n\nThe drilling results below (at true width) continue to support the view of a high-grade, long-life mining complex at Great Bear, with recent results showing extension of mineralization at depth across multiple zones.\n\nAt Yuma, results continue to intersect higher grade mineralization at depth in close proximity to the current resource, with holes BR-843AC3 and BR-695C1A intersecting 10.2m @ 18.59 g/t at 975m vertical depth and 6.2m @ 6.24 g/t at 1,085m vertical depth, respectively.\n\nAt Yauro, BR-708AC1B intersected 2.0m @ 11.41 g/t at a vertical depth of 1,095m well below the current resources, showing the potential for Yauro to continue to expand at depth with high grade mineralization, similar to how depth extensions progressed with continued drilling at Yuma.\n\nAt Auro, recent drilling also intersected high grade mineralization with a minable width below the current resources with hole BR-882 intersecting 6.1m @ 25.71 g/t at a vertical depth of 720m.\n\nAt Discovery to the northwest, hole BR-847 has intersected 2.4m @ 5.53 g/t at 870m in the under-tested area beneath the current resource, demonstrating continuity of mineralization between previously reported drill holes. The 2024 drill program will continue to target mineralization below the existing mineral resource, explore for additional deposits along strike, and expand our Red Lake style mineralization at Hinge and Limb.\n\nFor the Advanced Exploration (AEX) program, Kinross is progressing provincial permitting, engineering, and execution planning activities that would establish an underground decline to obtain a bulk sample and allow for definition and infill drilling in the LP zone. Kinross has the necessary surface rights to develop the AEX project, subject to obtaining the required provincial permits.\n\nDetailed engineering, execution planning, and procurement continue to progress well. Some required infrastructure such as the camp and water treatment plant have now been purchased.\n\nKinross is targeting a start of the surface construction for the AEX program in the second half of 2024, subject to receipt of permits, with start of the underground decline planned in mid-2025.\n\nFor the Main Project, Kinross continues to advance technical studies, including engineering and field test work campaigns. In the last quarter, substantial geotechnical field work was conducted to help de-risk project construction through strong early technical studies.\n\nKinross remains on track to release a PEA in the second half of 2024. Kinross has opted to pursue a PEA as it enables the inclusion of a portion of the inferred underground resource. This provides visibility into the potential production scale, construction capital, all-in sustaining cost and margins for both the open pit and the underground. The PEA will only include a subset of the ounces in the measured, indicated, and inferred resources drilled to date.\n\nThe Detailed Project Description for the Main Project was submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada in Q1 2024, as planned, and the Federal Impact Assessment is underway. Studies are ongoing and the Company expects to file its Impact Statement in the first half of 2025.\n\nSelected Great Bear Drill Results\r\nSee Appendix A for full results.\n\nHole ID  From \r\n(m) To \r\n(m) Width \r\n(m) True Width \r\n(m)  Au \r\n(g/t) Target  BR-695C1A 1,324.7 1,333.0 8.3 7.3 5.35 Yuma BR-695C1A Including 1,324.7 1,331.7 7.0 6.2 6.24 BR-695C1A 1,441.2 1,444.2 3.0 2.6 0.58 BR-695C1A 1,469.0 1,517.5 48.5 42.7 0.86 BR-695C1A Including 1,502.6 1,506.3 3.7 2.8 4.49 BR-695C1A 1,524.5 1,537.8 13.3 11.3 0.81 BR-708AC1B 1,271.7 1,276.7 5.0 4.5 0.64 Yauro BR-708AC1B 1,319.9 1,323.7 3.8 3.4 0.50 BR-708AC1B 1,376.2 1,441.7 65.5 59.0 0.96 BR-708AC1B Including 1,438.7 1,441.1 2.4 2.0 11.41 BR-843AC3 1,256.3 1,259.8 3.5 2.7 0.68 Yuma BR-843AC3 1,354.7 1,395.0 40.3 36.3 5.65 BR-843AC3 1,377.4 1,388.8 11.3 10.2 18.59 BR-843AC3 1,509.7 1,513.7 4.0 3.5 3.39 BR-847 934.7 950.0 15.3 13.0 2.08 Discovery BR-847 Including 934.7 937.5 2.8 2.4 5.21 BR-847 975.0 992.5 17.5 14.9 0.85 BR-847 998.8 1,001.8 3.0 2.6 0.48 BR-847 1,027.2 1,036.1 8.9 7.8 1.54 BR-847 1,048.5 1,051.5 3.0 2.7 0.35 BR-847 1,052.9 1,080.0 27.1 24.4 1.38 BR-847 Including 1,063.6 1,066.3 2.7 2.4 5.53 BR-882 953.0 957.5 4.5 3.7 0.45 Auro BR-882 1,015.2 1,022.4 7.2 6.1 25.71 BR-882 Including 1,017.5 1,019.4 1.9 1.6 95.27\n\nResults are preliminary in nature and are subject to on-going QA/QC. Lengths are subject to rounding.\n\nSee Appendix B for a LP zone long section.\n\nFort Knox\n\nAt the Kinross-operated, 70%-owned Manh Choh project, the Company is on track for first production in early Q3 2024. Ore and waste mining are ongoing with the full mining fleet now in operation as planned. Following several months of orientation runs, transportation of ore to Fort Knox, where the ore will be processed, continues to ramp up with all contracted trucks received, the majority of the drivers onboarded, and trailer manufacturing now complete.\n\nAt Fort Knox, mill modifications and site preparation remain on plan, including the completion of the ore delivery road and tie-ins for the pebble recycle conveyor. Building construction is advancing well, along with interior piping and electrical works.\n\nRound Mountain\n\nThe extension strategy at Round Mountain is advancing well. At Phase S, mining is on plan. For the heap leach pad expansion, earthworks began during the quarter, procurement is advancing as expected and construction activities remain on track.\n\nAt Phase X, development of the exploration decline is progressing well, with over 1,800 metres\u00a0developed to date. The decline has now progressed to the point that infill drilling of the primary Phase X target can commence in Q2 2024, as planned.\n\nThe Company also took the opportunity, as the decline was advancing, to perform exploration drilling in between the open pit and the underground target. This drilling13 has intersected high-grade mineralization with significant widths in this area outside of the primary Phase X target, which is also an area that did not have significant historic drilling, as highlighted below:\n\nDX-0012: 8.4m @ 16.6 g/t Au Eq DX-0019: 21.3m @ 9.9 g/t Au Eq DX-0014: 9.1m @ 9.5 g/t Au Eq\n\nThese results show potential for expansion of the target area for mineralization and for potential future mining at Phase X (see Appendix C).\n\nAt Gold Hill, infill drilling of the underground targets is being completed from the bottom of the historical pit and exploration drilling is being completed from surface, testing continuity and extensions at depth and on strike.\n\nChile\n\nKinross\u2019 activities in Chile are currently focused on La Coipa and potential opportunities to extend its mine life. The\u00a0Lobo-Marte\u00a0project continues to provide optionality as a potential large, low-cost mine upon the conclusion of mining at La Coipa. While the Company focuses its technical resources on La Coipa, it will continue to engage and build relationships with communities related to Lobo-Marte and government stakeholders.\n\nCurlew Basin exploration\n\nAt Curlew, Kinross is working on optimizing the potential mine design with a focus on improving the efficiency and margin of potential underground mining. The Company continues to progress underground drilling to follow up on recent high-grade intersections at the Roadrunner and Stealth vein zones, and has intersected multiple zones of stockwork veining with assays pending.\n\nConference call details\n\nIn connection with this news release, Kinross will hold a conference call and audio webcast on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, at 7:45 a.m. EDT to discuss the results, followed by a question-and-answer session.

(f) La Coipa silver grade and recovery were as follows: Q1 2024: 87.20 g/t, 58%; Q4 2023: 96.24 g/t, 44%; Q3 2023: 106.70 g/t, 63%; Q2 2023: 109.84 g/t, 56%; Q1 2023: 125.77 g/t, 70%. (g) The Fort Knox segment is composed of Fort Knox and Manh Choh, and comparative results shown are presented in accordance with the current year\u2019s presentation. Manh Choh tonnes of ore processed and grade were nil for all periods presented as production is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2024. The attributable results for Fort Knox include 100% of Fort Knox and 70% of Manh Choh.\n\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and ratios\n\nThe Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios in this document. These financial measures and ratios are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these financial measures and ratios, together with financial measures and ratios determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these financial measures and ratios is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures and ratios are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\r\n\r\nAdjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted Net Earnings per Share\n\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios which determine the performance of the Company, excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period, such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, reassessment of prior year taxes and/or taxes otherwise not related to the current period, impairment charges (reversals), gains and losses and other one-time costs related to acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions, and non-hedge derivative gains and losses. Although some of the items are recurring, the Company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Management believes that these measures and ratios, which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results, provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance, particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance. However, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share measures and ratios are not necessarily indicative of net earnings and earnings per share measures and ratios as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, \r\nexcept per share amounts)  Three months ended March 31, 2024  2023  Net earnings attributable to common shareholders - as reported $ 107.0 $ 90.2 Adjusting items: Foreign exchange gains (3.5 ) (3.8 ) Foreign exchange losses (gains) on translation of tax basis and foreign exchange\u00a0on deferred income taxes within income tax expense 4.0 (13.2 ) Taxes in respect of prior periods 8.0 12.0 Other(a) 10.5 2.8 Tax effects of the above adjustments (1.1 ) (0.4 ) 17.9 (2.6 ) Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders $ 124.9 $ 87.6 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 1,228.3 1,225.0 Adjusted net earnings per share $ 0.10 $ 0.07 Basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders - as reported $ 0.09 $ 0.07\n\n(a) Other includes various impacts, such as one-time costs at sites, restructuring costs, and gains and losses on hedges and the sale of assets, which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period.\n\nAttributable Free Cash Flow\n\nAttributable free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash flow provided from operating activities less attributable capital expenditures and non-controlling interest included in net cash flows provided from operating activities. The Company believes that this measure, which is used internally to evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying cash generation performance and the ability to repay creditors and return cash to shareholders, provides investors with the ability to better evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying performance. However, this measure is not necessarily indicative of operating earnings or net cash flow provided from operating activities as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars)  Three months ended March 31, 2024 2023 Net cash flow provided from operating activities - as reported $ 374.4  $ 259.0 Adjusting items: Attributable(a) capital expenditures (232.1 ) (211.8 ) Non-controlling interest(b) cash flow used in operating activities 3.0  0.6 Attributable(a) free cash flow $ 145.3  $ 47.8\n\nSee page 21 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAdjusted Operating Cash Flow\n\nAdjusted operating cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash flow provided from operating activities excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital. Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors, including the timing of tax payments. The Company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow-generating capability of the Company. However, the adjusted operating cash flow measure is not necessarily indicative of net cash flow provided from operating activities as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars)  Three months ended March 31, 2024  2023  Net cash flow provided from operating activities - as reported $ 374.4 $ 259.0 Adjusting items: Working capital changes: Accounts receivable and other assets (10.3 ) (20.0 ) Inventories (5.9 ) 43.2 Accounts payable and other liabilities, including income taxes paid 66.7 76.0 Total working capital changes 50.5 99.2 Adjusted operating cash flow $ 424.9 $ 358.2\n\nSee page 21 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nProduction Cost of Sales per Ounce Sold on a By-Product Basis(l)\n\nProduction cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP ratio which calculates the Company\u2019s non-gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs, rather than converting its non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production, as is the case in co-product accounting. Management believes that this ratio provides investors with the ability to better evaluate Kinross\u2019 production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by-product accounting rather than co-product accounting.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars,\r\nexcept ounces and production cost of sales per equivalent ounce)  Three months ended March 31, 2024  2023  Production cost of sales - as reported $ 512.9 $ 483.9 Less: silver revenue(c) (39.1 ) (54.9 ) Production cost of sales net of silver by-product revenue $ 473.8 $ 429.0 Gold ounces sold 503,604 461,696 Total gold equivalent ounces sold 522,400 490,330 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold(d) $ 982 $ 987 Production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 941 $ 929\n\nSee page 21 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAll-In Sustaining Cost(l) and Attributable All-In Cost per Ounce Sold on a By-Product Basis\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, as applicable, calculated based on guidance published by the World Gold Council (\u201cWGC\u201d). The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including Kinross. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these metrics. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, these measures and ratios presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures and ratios presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost measures complement existing measures and ratios reported by Kinross.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. The value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production, i.e. a by-product. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production. Sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs, including capitalized stripping, and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\n\nAll-in cost is comprised of all-in sustaining cost as well as operating expenditures incurred at locations with no current operation, or costs related to other non-sustaining activities, and capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis are calculated by adjusting production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, as follows:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, \r\nexcept ounces and costs per ounce)  Three months ended March 31, 2024 2023 Production cost of sales - as reported $ 512.9  $ 483.9 Less: silver revenue(c) (39.1 ) (54.9 ) Production cost of sales net of silver by-product revenue $ 473.8  $ 429.0 Adjusting items: General and administrative(e) 30.7  24.4 Other operating expense - sustaining(f) 0.8  6.5 Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(g) 18.3  14.3 Exploration and business development - sustaining(h) 8.7  6.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(i) 109.3  96.6 Lease payments - sustaining(j) 3.4  15.2 All-in Sustaining Cost on a by-product basis $ 645.0  $ 592.6 Adjusting items on an attributable(a) basis: Other operating expense - non-sustaining(f) 10.1  8.7 Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(g) 1.7  1.9 Exploration and business development - non-sustaining(h) 32.9  27.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(i) 122.8  115.2 Lease payments - non-sustaining(j) -  0.3 All-in Cost on a by-product basis - attributable(a) $ 812.5  $ 746.3 Gold ounces sold 503,604  461,696 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold(d) $ 982  $ 987 All-in sustaining cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 1,281  $ 1,284 Attributable(a) all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 1,613  $ 1,616\n\nSee page 21 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nThe Company also assesses its all-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis. Under these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, the Company\u2019s production of silver is converted into gold equivalent ounces and credited to total production.\n\nAll-In Sustaining Cost(l) and Attributable All-In Cost per Equivalent Ounce Sold\n\nThe Company also assesses its all-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis. Under these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, the Company\u2019s production of silver is converted into gold equivalent ounces and credited to total production.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost per equivalent ounce sold are calculated by adjusting production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, as follows:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars,\r\nexcept ounces and costs per ounce)  Three months ended March 31, 2024 2023 Production cost of sales - as reported $ 512.9 $ 483.9 Adjusting items: General and administrative(e) 30.7 24.4 Other operating expense - sustaining(f) 0.8 6.5 Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(g) 18.3 14.3 Exploration and business development - sustaining(h) 8.7 6.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(i) 109.3 96.6 Lease payments - sustaining(j) 3.4 15.2 All-in Sustaining Cost $ 684.1 $ 647.5 Adjusting items on an attributable(a)basis: Other operating expense - non-sustaining(f) 10.1 8.7 Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(g) 1.7 1.9 Exploration and business development - non-sustaining(h) 32.9 27.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(i) 122.8 115.2 Lease payments - non-sustaining(j) - 0.3 All-in Cost - attributable(a) $ 851.6 $ 801.2 Gold equivalent ounces sold 522,400 490,330 Production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold(d) $ 982 $ 987 All-in sustaining cost per equivalent ounce sold $ 1,310 $ 1,321 Attributable(a)all-in cost per equivalent ounce sold $ 1,630 $ 1,634\n\nSee page 21 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nCapital Expenditures and Attributable Capital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are classified as either sustaining capital expenditures or non-sustaining capital expenditures, depending on the nature of the expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditures typically represent capital expenditures at existing operations including capitalized exploration costs and capitalized stripping unless related to major projects, ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and other capital expenditures and is calculated as total additions to property, plant and equipment (as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows), less non-sustaining capital expenditures. Non-sustaining capital expenditures represent capital expenditures for major projects, including major capital stripping projects at existing operations that are expected to materially benefit the operation, as well as enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Management believes the distinction between sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining expenditures is a useful indicator of the purpose of capital expenditures and this distinction is an input into the calculation of all-in sustaining costs per ounce and attributable all-in costs per ounce. The categorization of sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures is consistent with the definitions under the WGC all-in cost standard. Sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures are not defined under IFRS, however, the sum of these two measures total to additions to property, plant and equipment as disclosed under IFRS on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment per the statement of cash flow includes 100% of capital expenditures for Manh Choh. Attributable capital expenditures includes Kinross' 70% share of capital expenditures for Manh Choh. Management believes this to be a useful indicator of Kinross\u2019 cash resources utilized for capital expenditures.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the classification of capital expenditures for the periods presented:\n\n(unaudited, expressed in millions of U.S. dollars) Three months ended March 31, 2024 Tasiast\r\n(Mauritania) Paracatu \r\n(Brazil) La Coipa\r\n(Chile) Fort Knox(k) (USA) Round Mountain\r\n(USA) Bald Mountain\r\n(USA) Total\r\nUSA Other Total Sustaining capital expenditures $ 10.1 $ 19.6 $ 7.2 $ 37.7 $ 3.7 $ 32.4 $ 73.8 $ (1.4 ) $ 109.3 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 69.4 - - 40.9 15.6 - 56.5 6.7 132.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 79.5 $ 19.6 $ 7.2 $ 78.6 $ 19.3 $ 32.4 $ 130.3 $ 5.3 $ 241.9 Less: Non-controlling interest(b) $ - $ - $ - $ (9.8 ) $ - $ - $ (9.8 ) $ - $ (9.8 ) Attributable(a)capital expenditures $ 79.5 $ 19.6 $ 7.2 $ 68.8 $ 19.3 $ 32.4 $ 120.5 $ 5.3 $ 232.1 Three months ended March 31, 2023 Sustaining capital expenditures $ 14.6 $ 27.8 $ 1.6 $ 38.6 $ 7.4 $ 6.1 $ 52.1 $ 0.4 $ 96.5 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 50.0 - 23.8 29.2 - 19.1 48.3 2.6 124.7 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 64.6 $ 27.8 $ 25.4 $ 67.8 $ 7.4 $ 25.2 $ 100.4 $ 3.0 $ 221.2 Less: Non-controlling interest(b) $ - $ - $ - $ (9.4 ) $ - $ - $ (9.4 ) $ - $ (9.4 ) Attributable(a) capital expenditures $ 64.6 $ 27.8 $ 25.4 $ 58.4 $ 7.4 $ 25.2 $ 91.0 $ 3.0 $ 211.8\n\nSee page 21 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nEndnotes\n\n(a) \u201cAttributable\u201d includes Kinross\u2019 share of Manh Choh (70%) free cash flow, costs and capital expenditures. (b) \u201cNon-controlling interest\u201d represents the non-controlling interest portion in Manh Choh (30%) and other subsidiaries for which the Company\u2019s interest is less than 100% for cash flow from operating activities and capital expenditures. (c) \u201cSilver revenue\u201d represents the portion of metal sales realized from the production of the secondary or by-product metal (i.e. silver). Revenue from the sale of silver, which is produced as a by-product of the process used to produce gold, effectively reduces the cost of gold production. (d) \u201cProduction cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold. (e) \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d expenses are as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations. General and administrative expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required to be absorbed on a continuing basis for the effective operation and governance of the Company. (f) \u201cOther operating expense \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cOther operating expense\u201d as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, less other operating and reclamation and remediation expenses related to non-sustaining activities as well as other items not reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. Other operating expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on the type and location of the expenditure incurred. The majority of other operating expenses that are incurred at existing operations are considered costs necessary to sustain operations, and are therefore classified as sustaining. Other operating expenses incurred at locations where there is no current operation or related to other non-sustaining activities are classified as non-sustaining. (g) \u201cReclamation and remediation - sustaining\u201d is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets, and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines. Reclamation and remediation costs for development projects or closed mines are excluded from this amount and classified as non-sustaining. (h) \u201cExploration and business development \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cExploration and business development\u201d expenses as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, less non-sustaining exploration and business development expenses. Exploration expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type and location of the exploration expenditure. Exploration expenditures within the footprint of operating mines are considered costs required to sustain current operations and so are included in sustaining costs. Exploration expenditures focused on new ore bodies near existing mines (i.e. brownfield), new exploration projects (i.e. greenfield) or for other generative exploration activity not linked to existing mining operations are classified as non-sustaining. Business development expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type of expense and requirement for general or growth related operations. (i) \u201cAdditions to property, plant and equipment \u2013 sustaining\u201d and non-sustaining are as presented on pages 20 and 21. Non-sustaining capital expenditures included in the calculation of attributable all-in-cost includes Kinross\u2019 share of Manh Choh (70%) costs. (j) \u201cLease payments \u2013 sustaining\u201d represents the majority of lease payments as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is made up of the principal and financing components of such cash payments, less non-sustaining lease payments. Lease payments for development projects or closed mines are classified as non-sustaining. (k) The Fort Knox segment is composed of Fort Knox and Manh Choh for all periods presented. (l) As production from Manh Choh is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2024, production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios for Manh Choh are nil for all periods presented. As a result, production cost of sales and all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios are equal to attributable production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios, as applicable.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nRecent LP zone assay results\n\nHole ID From \r\n(m) To \r\n(m) Width \r\n(m) True \r\nWidth (m)  Au (g/t) Target BR-695C1A 1,324.7 1,333.0 8.3 7.3 5.35 Yuma BR-695C1A Including 1,324.7 1,331.7 7.0 6.2 6.24 BR-695C1A 1,441.2 1,444.2 3.0 2.6 0.58 BR-695C1A 1,469.0 1,517.5 48.5 42.7 0.86 BR-695C1A Including 1,502.6 1,506.3 3.7 2.8 4.49 BR-695C1A 1,524.5 1,537.8 13.3 11.3 0.81 BR-695C2 1,460.3 1,463.3 3.0 2.7 0.61 Yuma BR-695C2 1,477.9 1,482.6 4.7 4.2 0.58 BR-695C2 1,509.0 1,521.4 12.4 11.2 0.82 BR-695C2 1,532.5 1,536.1 3.6 3.2 1.08 BR-695C3 No Significant Intersections Yuma BR-708AC1B 1,271.7 1,276.7 5.0 4.5 0.64 Yauro BR-708AC1B 1,319.9 1,323.7 3.8 3.4 0.50 BR-708AC1B 1,376.2 1,441.7 65.5 59.0 0.96 BR-708AC1B Including 1,438.7 1,441.1 2.4 2.0 11.41 BR-708AC2 No Significant Intersections Yauro BR-770C1 541.3 544.9 3.6 3.0 2.13 Yauro BR-770C1 1,229.9 1,236.9 6.9 5.8 1.60 BR-770C1 1,293.5 1,297.1 3.6 3.0 1.13 BR-770C1 1,304.0 1,307.0 3.0 2.5 1.88 BR-770C2B No Significant Intersections Yauro BR-799DC1 1,566.7 1,573.7 7.0 5.2 0.91 Bruma BR-799DC1 1,584.5 1,591.9 7.5 5.6 0.61 BR-843AC2 1,189.5 1,192.5 3.0 2.3 1.19 Yuma BR-843AC2 1,245.0 1,248.0 3.0 2.3 0.33 BR-843AC2 1,316.4 1,319.4 3.0 2.6 0.48 BR-843AC2 1,321.7 1,325.3 3.5 2.7 0.39 BR-843AC2 1,335.5 1,347.3 11.8 8.9 2.91 BR-843AC2 Including 1,337.8 1,340.5 2.7 2.4 9.66 BR-843AC2 1,365.5 1,373.1 7.6 6.7 0.91 BR-843AC2 1,376.5 1,379.5 3.0 2.7 0.55 BR-843AC3 1,256.3 1,259.8 3.5 2.7 0.68 Yuma BR-843AC3 1,354.7 1,395.0 40.3 36.3 5.65 BR-843AC3 1,377.4 1,388.8 11.3 10.2 18.59 BR-843AC3 1,509.7 1,513.7 4.0 3.5 3.39 BR-844C2B 1,444.1 1,450.2 6.1 5.4 0.81 Bruma BR-844C2B 1,500.9 1,527.0 26.2 23.0 0.52 BR-844C3A 1,436.8 1,440.0 3.2 2.8 1.08 Bruma BR-844C3A 1,502.0 1,509.1 7.1 6.1 0.95 BR-844C3A 1,518.0 1,530.0 12.0 10.2 0.65 BR-847 934.7 950.0 15.3 13.0 2.08 Discovery BR-847 Including 934.7 937.5 2.8 2.4 5.21 BR-847 975.0 992.5 17.5 14.9 0.85 BR-847 998.8 1,001.8 3.0 2.6 0.48 BR-847 1,027.2 1,036.1 8.9 7.8 1.54 BR-847 1,048.5 1,051.5 3.0 2.7 0.35 BR-847 1,052.9 1,080.0 27.1 24.4 1.38 BR-847 Including 1,063.6 1,066.3 2.7 2.4 5.53 BR-848 1,015.3 1,024.8 9.5 7.9 0.70 Bruma BR-848 1,031.2 1,054.3 23.1 19.4 0.51 BR-848 1,095.4 1,113.7 18.3 15.3 0.61 BR-849 867.0 872.4 5.4 4.3 0.91 Bruma BR-849 884.5 897.5 13.1 10.4 0.70 BR-849 916.0 920.9 4.9 4.0 0.95 BR-851 No Significant Intersections Viggo BR-853 469.9 474.5 4.6 3.8 1.34 Auro BR-853 665.5 668.5 3.0 2.3 0.42 BR-854A 701.5 706.0 4.5 4.0 1.13 Auro BR-854A 874.0 880.1 6.0 5.3 4.79 BR-854A Including 878.5 880.1 1.5 1.4 17.73 BR-855 810.2 814.5 4.4 3.8 1.63 Discovery BR-856A No Significant Intersections Discovery BR-870C5B 1,229.0 1,232.0 3.0 2.6 0.39 Yuma BR-870C5B 1,313.5 1,319.0 5.5 4.7 0.68 BR-870C5B 1,349.2 1,353.0 3.8 3.3 0.51 BR-870C5B 1,366.3 1,380.5 14.2 12.2 1.53 BR-871 1,173.5 1,194.7 21.3 18.3 0.36 Yuma BR-872 990.6 997.4 6.8 6.1 0.42 Yuma BR-872 1,005.8 1,010.3 4.5 3.7 0.80 BR-872 1,017.2 1,033.5 16.3 12.9 0.54 BR-882 953.0 957.5 4.5 3.7 0.45 Auro BR-882 1,015.2 1,022.4 7.2 6.1 25.71 BR-882 Including 1,017.5 1,019.4 1.9 1.6 95.27 BR-884 716.9 722.8 5.9 4.9 2.56 Auro BR-884 Including 720.1 722.8 2.6 2.3 4.55 BR-884 801.4 805.9 4.5 3.9 0.83 BR-885 714.1 715.5 1.4 1.1 26.60 Yuma BR-885 871.4 883.2 11.9 9.4 1.36 BR-885 914.1 922.7 8.5 6.8 0.73 BR-886 1,060.5 1,070.7 10.2 8.0 0.39 Yuma BR-886 1,078.2 1,085.4 7.3 5.7 2.80 BR-886 Including 1,082.4 1,084.5 2.2 1.7 7.86 BR-886 1,131.1 1,134.2 3.1 2.7 1.26 BR-886 1,141.7 1,160.7 19.0 16.9 0.76 BR-886 1,170.0 1,175.8 5.8 4.8 1.33 BR-886 1,184.7 1,188.0 3.3 2.7 0.49 BR-886 1,231.2 1,231.7 0.5 0.4 44.80 BR-891 432.0 435.0 3.0 2.5 1.07 Discovery BR-891 1,096.0 1,111.0 15.1 12.3 1.44 BR-891 Including 1,096.6 1,100.1 3.5 2.9 3.00 BR-891 1,117.5 1,125.0 7.5 6.2 0.82 BR-891 1,137.0 1,141.0 4.0 3.3 0.52 BR-891 1,194.0 1,197.0 3.0 2.5 0.40 BR-891 1,242.3 1,308.4 66.1 54.2 0.42 BR-900B 1,214.6 1,223.6 9.0 7.4 0.73 Yauro DL-131C4 929.2 934.3 5.1 4.3 1.24 Hinge DL-131C5 No Significant Intersections Hinge DL-131C6 No Significant Intersections Hinge DL-131C6W No Significant Intersections Hinge\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nGreat Bear: LP long section demonstrating potential for extension of a high-grade underground resource.

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Kinross as of the date of such statements, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. The estimates, models and assumptions of Kinross referenced, contained or incorporated by reference in this news release, which may prove to be incorrect, include, but are not limited to, the various assumptions set forth herein and in our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Annual Information Form dated March 27, 2024 as well as: (1) there being no significant disruptions affecting the operations of the Company, whether due to extreme weather events (including, without limitation, excessive snowfall, excessive or lack of rainfall, in particular, the potential for further production curtailments at Paracatu resulting from insufficient rainfall and the operational challenges at Fort Knox and Bald Mountain resulting from excessive rainfall or snowfall, which can impact costs and/or production) and other or related natural disasters, labour disruptions (including but not limited to strikes or workforce reductions), supply disruptions, power disruptions, damage to equipment, pit wall slides or otherwise; (2) permitting, development, operations and production from the Company\u2019s operations and development projects being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations including, without limitation: the maintenance of existing permits and approvals and the timely receipt of all permits and authorizations necessary for the operation of Tasiast; water and power supply and continued operation of the tailings reprocessing facility at Paracatu; permitting of the Great Bear project (including the consultation process with Indigenous groups), permitting and development of the Lobo-Marte project; in each case in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations; and the successful completion of exploration consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations at the Company\u2019s projects; (3) political and legal developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations including, without limitation, restrictions or penalties imposed, or actions taken, by any government, including but not limited to amendments to the mining laws, and potential power rationing and tailings facility regulations in Brazil (including those related to financial assurance requirements), potential amendments to water laws and/or other water use restrictions and regulatory actions in Chile, new dam safety regulations, potential amendments to minerals and mining laws and energy levies laws, new regulations relating to work permits, potential amendments to customs and mining laws (including but not limited to amendments to the VAT) and the potential application of the tax code in Mauritania, potential amendments to and enforcement of tax laws in Mauritania (including, but not limited to, the interpretation, implementation, application and enforcement of any such laws and amendments thereto), potential third party legal challenges to existing permits, and the impact of any trade tariffs being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (4) the completion of studies, including scoping studies, preliminary economic assessments, pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, on the timelines currently expected and the results of those studies being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (5) the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Mauritanian ouguiya and the U.S. dollar being approximately consistent with current levels; (6) certain price assumptions for gold and silver; (7) prices for diesel, natural gas, fuel oil, electricity and other key supplies being approximately consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations; (8) attributable production and cost of sales forecasts for the Company meeting expectations; (9) the accuracy of the current mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates of the Company and Kinross\u2019 analysis thereof being consistent with expectations (including but not limited to ore tonnage and ore grade estimates), future mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates being consistent with preliminary work undertaken by the Company, mine plans for the Company\u2019s current and future mining operations, and the Company\u2019s internal models; (10) labour and materials costs increasing on a basis consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (11) the terms and conditions of the legal and fiscal stability agreements for Tasiast being interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with their intent and Kinross\u2019 expectations and without material amendment or formal dispute (including without limitation the application of tax, customs and duties exemptions and royalties); (12) asset impairment potential; (13) the regulatory and legislative regime regarding mining, electricity production and transmission (including rules related to power tariffs) in Brazil being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (14) access to capital markets, including but not limited to maintaining our current credit ratings consistent with the Company\u2019s current expectations; (15) potential direct or indirect operational impacts resulting from infectious diseases or pandemics; (16) changes in national and local government legislation or other government actions, including the Canadian federal impact assessment regime; (17) litigation, regulatory proceedings and audits, and the potential ramifications thereof, being concluded in a manner consistent with the Corporation\u2019s expectations (including without limitation litigation in Chile relating to the alleged damage of wetlands and the scope of any remediation plan or other environmental obligations arising therefrom); (18) the Company\u2019s financial results, cash flows and future prospects being consistent with Company expectations in amounts sufficient to permit sustained dividend payments; and (19) the impacts of detected pit wall instability at Round Mountain and Bald Mountain being consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the inaccuracy of any of the foregoing assumptions; fluctuations in the currency markets; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold or certain other commodities (such as fuel and electricity); price inflation of goods and services; changes in the discount rates applied to calculate the present value of net future cash flows based on country-specific real weighted average cost of capital; changes in the market valuations of peer group gold producers and the Company, and the resulting impact on market price to net asset value multiples; changes in various market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, gold or silver prices and lease rates, or global fuel prices, that could impact the mark-to-market value of outstanding derivative instruments and ongoing payments/receipts under any financial obligations; risks arising from holding derivative instruments (such as credit risk, market liquidity risk and mark-to-market risk); changes in national and local government legislation, taxation (including but not limited to income tax, advance income tax, stamp tax, withholding tax, capital tax, tariffs, value-added or sales tax, capital outflow tax, capital gains tax, windfall or windfall profits tax, production royalties, excise tax, customs/import or export taxes/duties, asset taxes, asset transfer tax, property use or other real estate tax, together with any related fine, penalty, surcharge, or interest imposed in connection with such taxes), controls, policies and regulations; the security of personnel and assets; political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Chile, Brazil, Mauritania or other countries in which Kinross does business or may carry on business; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, us; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and complete divestitures; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining, development or refining activities; employee relations; litigation or other claims against, or regulatory investigations and/or any enforcement actions, administrative orders or sanctions in respect of the Company (and/or its directors, officers, or employees) including, but not limited to, securities class action litigation in Canada and/or the United States, environmental litigation or regulatory proceedings or any investigations, enforcement actions and/or sanctions under any applicable anti-corruption, international sanctions and/or anti-money laundering laws and regulations in Canada, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction; the speculative nature of gold exploration and development including, but not limited to, the risks of obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses and permits; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; adverse changes in our credit ratings; and contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or the inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can directly or indirectly affect, and could cause, Kinross\u2019 actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Kinross, including but not limited to resulting in an impairment charge on goodwill and/or assets. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management\u2019s expectations and plans relating to the future. All of the forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by this cautionary statement and those made in our other filings with the securities regulators of Canada and the United States including, but not limited to, the cautionary statements made in the \u201cRisk Analysis\u201d section of our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth in the Company\u2019s Annual Information Form dated March 27, 2024. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Kinross. Kinross disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or to explain any material difference between subsequent actual events and such forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law.\n\nKey Sensitivities\n\nApproximately 70%-80% of the Company's costs are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nA 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would be expected to result in an approximate $20 impact on production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold14.\n\nSpecific to the Brazilian real, a 10% change in the exchange rate would be expected to result in an approximate $40 impact on Brazilian production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold.\n\nSpecific to the Chilean peso, a 10% change in the exchange rate would be expected to result in an approximate $30 impact on Chilean production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold.\n\nA $10 per barrel change in the price of oil would be expected to result in an approximate $3 impact on production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold.\n\nA $100 change in the price of gold would be expected to result in an approximate $4 impact on production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold as a result of a change in royalties.\n\nOther information\n\nWhere we say \"we\", \"us\", \"our\", the \"Company\", or \"Kinross\" in this news release, we mean Kinross Gold Corporation and/or one or more or all of its subsidiaries, as may be applicable.\n\nThe technical information about the Company\u2019s mineral properties contained in this news release has been prepared under the supervision of Mr. Nicos Pfeiffer, an officer of the Company who is a \u201cqualified person\u201d within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101.\n\nSource: Kinross Gold Corporation\n\n1 \u201cProduction cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales, as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold.\r\n2 As production from Manh Choh is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2024, production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios for Manh Choh are nil for all periods presented. As a result, production cost of sales and all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios are equal to attributable production cost of sales and attributable all-in sustaining cost figures and ratios, as applicable.\r\n3 These figures are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, as applicable, and are defined and reconciled on pages 16 to 21 of this news release. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios have no standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. \r\n4 \u201cMargins\u201d per equivalent ounce sold is defined as average realized gold price per ounce less production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold. \r\n5 Operating cash flow figures in this release represent \u201cNet cash flow provided from operating activities,\u201d as reported on the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. \r\n6 \u201cAttributable\u201d includes Kinross\u2019 70% share of Manh Choh production, costs and capital expenditures.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Kinross Gold Corporation. KGC may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because Kinross is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for KGC in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for KGC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.49% heading into earnings season.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nKinross Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Kinross Gold Corporation Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that KGC has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Kinross, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (IDR) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.17 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.06 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 183.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.02, delivering a surprise of -60%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nIdaho Strategic Resources , which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, posted revenues of $5.9 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.39%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.34 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nIdaho Strategic Resources shares have added about 20.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Idaho Strategic Resources?\n\nWhile Idaho Strategic Resources has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Idaho Strategic Resources: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.07 on $5.2 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.27 on $20.4 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Mining - Gold is currently in the top 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 7.\n\nThis gold mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 39.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nKinross Gold's revenues are expected to be $876.86 million, down 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Elliott Management's $1B Anglo American Stake Ups Ante As Mining Megamerger Collapses\n\nActivist investor Elliott Management has quietly built a $1 billion stake in Anglo American (OTCQX:NGLOY), adding pressure to the UK-listed mining giant after it became the target of a $39 billion takeover bid from BHP Group (NYSE:BHP). This development emerged after Anglo American's board rejected BHP\u2019s offer, deeming it \u201chighly unattractive\u201d due to its undervaluation of the company\u2019s prospects and its complex structure.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Elliott Management, led by billionaire Paul Singer, has amassed this holding over the last months. Persons with knowledge of the matter requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the information. The UK takeover rules require shareholders involved in potential deals to disclose their holdings if they hold more than 1% in either the target or bidding firm.\n\nNow Read: Copper Is A Hot Commodity: Bidding War for Anglo American May Emerge After BHP\u2019s \u2018Low Ball\u2019 Offer \u2014 \u2018Let The Games Begin\u2019\n\nElliott has a history of taking sizable positions and advocating for strategic changes. In 2017, they started pressuring BHP to divest its oil assets and prioritize shareholder returns, resulting in a merger of their petroleum business with Woodside Energy Group. With this size of the stake, the firm would be among the top 10 shareholders of Anglo American, which has seen its stock surge as high as 6.7% on Friday.\n\nThis situation isn\u2019t Elliott\u2019s first venture into the mining sector. In 2022, the activist hedge fund was involved with Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC), prompting it to ramp up its share repurchase program significantly. It also holds a 66.6% stake in Triple Flag Precious Metals (NYSE:TFPM), a financial solutions provider in the sector.\n\nThe current involvement comes as copper prices hit $10,000 per ton, marking the first time in two years that the metal has reached this level. This spike is fueled by investor anticipation of a significant deficit in copper supplies due to increasing demand driven by green energy initiatives.\n\nBHP\u2019s proposed takeover, coupled with the rising price of copper, strengthens Anglo American\u2019s bargaining position. Whether Elliott Management intends to push for similar strategic changes within Anglo-American or simply capitalize on the future value of copper remains to be determined.\n\nBenzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

        "title": "The Top 3 Under-$10 Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks, price matters. While most analysts concentrate on valuation, i.e. the price-to-earnings estimates, for retail investors the price at which shares can be purchased is of paramount importance. A lot of investors, for example, can\u2019t afford to buy a single share of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) right now with the stock trading at close to $3,000. However, after the company completes a 50-for-1 stock split in June and the price is lowered to less than $60, these investors will be able to snap up shares.\n\nMany investors with little cash on hand rightfully look for stocks that trade for less than $10 a share, enabling them to build a decent position in their portfolio. If a stock that has a low share price also has a compelling valuation and offers a dividend payout, then the stars may have aligned and you could have the makings of a great long-term investment. The key is to do one\u2019s homework and carefully evaluate a stock before buying it. Here are the top three under-$10 stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nBarclays (BCS) the Barclays (BCS) logo\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish bank Barclays (NYSE:BCS) is currently trading near a 52-week high but is still available for purchase at just under $10 per share. BCS stock is currently trading at $9.60 a share. Not only is the low share price attractive, but so too is the valuation and yield. Barclays trades at just seven times future earnings estimates and offers its shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 10 cents per share, giving BCS stock a strong yield of 4.19%. Barclays\u2019 shares are also on an upswing, having gained 21% so far in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBCS stock has been trending higher ever since the bank announced in February a strategic overhaul of its operations. The changes include cost cuts, asset sales, and a reorganization of its business divisions. Going forward, the 128-year-old bank will be divided into five operating units, separating the corporate and investment banking sides of the lender. Management said they are targeting cost savings of \u00a32 billion (US$2.5 billion) by 2026.\n\nBarclays also announced an additional share buyback of \u00a31 billion and promised to return \u00a310 billion to shareholders by 2026 through dividends and stock repurchases.\n\nKinross Gold Corp. (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that is moving in the right direction but can still be had for less than 10 bucks is Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC). Shares are currently trading at $6.56, but are up 30% in the past 12 months, including a year-to-date gain of 10%. KGC stock has been rising alongside the price of gold, which has hit multiple all-time highs in recent months. Currently trading at $2,335 an ounce, gold\u2019s price was sitting at a record high of $2,431.55 earlier in April.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strong rise in the price of bullion has lifted the fortunes of gold miners such as Kinross. Expectations are for Kinross and others to make hay while the sun shines and post strong financial results on the back of record prices. Prior to this year, KGC stock had struggled after the company divested a gold mine in Ghana and sold its Russian mining assets following that country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, sentiment towards Kinross has now shifted to the positive.\n\nBeyond the share price appreciation, KGC stock trades at 19 times future earnings estimates and pays a quarterly dividend of 3 cents per share, giving it a yield of 1.83%.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIs there a role for satellite radio into today\u2019s world of audio streaming? Warren Buffett seems to think so. The Oracle of Omaha currently owns more than 40 million shares of Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI), the company that has a virtual monopoly over satellite radio services. Buffett\u2019s stake in Sirius is worth $127.6 million, and despite SIRI stock steadily falling, the world\u2019s greatest investor remains a shareholder. Like Barclays, Sirius XM Holdings is cheap to buy.\n\nSIRI stock currently has a share price of $3.16, a forward P/E ratio of 9.76x, and a dividend yield of 3.36%. For value investors who like to bottom fish, Sirius XM Holdings\u2019 stock is currently near a 52-week low, having fallen 42% this year. The company has struggled with disappointing earnings and concerns have been raised about its growth potential given that most of its customers only listen to the radio network in their car. But some analyst are turning bullish.\n\nPivotal Research recently upgraded the stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from \u201chold\u201d previously and placed a $4.90 price target on the stock, implying 55% upside from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The banking giant has set its sights on a comprehensive transformation, highlighted by significant cost reductions, asset divestitures and a restructuring of its core business divisions.\n\nUnder this ambitious plan, Barclays will segment its operations into five distinct divisions, a strategic maneuver aimed at enhancing efficiency and focus. The bank is aiming for total gross savings of 2 billion pounds and a robust Return on Tangible Equity surpassing 12% by 2026. Moreover, Barclays is committed to reducing risk exposure within its investment bank, with plans to slash risk-weighted assets to approximately 50% by 2023, down from 58% the previous year.\n\nAdditionally, the bank aims to streamline its cost-to-income ratio within the investment bank to the high 50s in percentage terms, a significant improvement from the 69% recorded in the prior year. Barclays has also pledged a staggering 10 billion pounds allocation through dividends and share repurchases between 2024 and 2026, signaling confidence in its future trajectory.\n\nNokia\n\nIn the rapidly evolving telecommunications industry, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) has established itself as a prominent player. Despite facing stiff competition, Nokia, currently trading at $3.52, remains a solid dividend stock.\n\nThe telecom giant currently pays 13 cents in dividends annually, yielding 3.69% on its current stock price.\n\n\u201cIn 2023 we saw a meaningful shift in customer behavior impacting our industry driven by the macro-economic environment and high interest rates along with customer inventory digestion,\u201d Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark said.\n\nStory continues\n\nNokia\u2019s reported net profit showed an increase, reaching 438 million euros compared to 289 million euros in the previous year. Similarly, comparable net profit also witnessed growth, rising to 501 million euros from 342 million euros a year earlier.\n\nEarlier this year, on Jan. 25, 2024, Nokia announced plans to initiate a two-year 600 million euro ($653 million) share buyback program in the current quarter. This strategic move follows the company\u2019s acknowledgment of a profit downturn in the preceding fiscal year of 2023.\n\nEven though JPMorgan has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating for NOK, it has a price target of $4.26, indicating a potential upside of over 21%.\n\nKinross Gold\n\nAmid rising economic uncertainty and market volatility, gold has long been regarded as a safe-haven asset, offering investors a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. With gold prices hovering near their all-time highs of $2,383 per ounce earlier this month, investing in affordable gold stocks like Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) could be profitable. Currently trading at $6.77, Kinross Gold pays 12 cents in dividends annually.\n\n\u201c2023 was a great year at Kinross and I am proud of our global team who achieved the results that underpin our reputation as strong operators. We met our production, cost and capital guidance, and completed our projects at Tasiast and La Coipa. Our portfolio of mines produced solid results, we more than doubled free cash flow year-over-year while maintaining our investment grade balance sheet, and we are carrying this momentum into 2024,\u201d Kinross Gold President and CEO J. Paul Rollinson said in its last earnings release. \u201cWe expect to deliver another strong year in 2024, producing approximately 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian gold mining company offers investors exposure to the potential upside of gold prices while providing a steady stream of dividend income. As geopolitical tensions persist, Kinross Gold remains well-positioned to benefit from sustained demand for gold as a store of value.\n\nA Reliable Income Play Backed By Real Estate Equity\n\nCityfunds has introduced an exclusive opportunity for accredited investors to secure an impressive 7% \u2013 8% APY by capitalizing on the growing $32.6 trillion home equity market.

        "title": "Will Kinross Gold (KGC) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Kinross Gold (KGC), which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this gold mining company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 21.11%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Kinross Gold was expected to post earnings of $0.09 per share, but it reported $0.11 per share instead, representing a surprise of 22.22%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.10 per share, while it actually produced $0.12 per share, a surprise of 20%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Kinross Gold lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nKinross Gold has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7, 2024.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "AbraSilver Announces C$20 Million in Strategic Investments by Kinross Gold and Central Puerto and Formation of a Regional Partnership in Argentina",
        "content": "TORONTO, April 22, 2024 /CNW/ - AbraSilver Resource Corp. (TSXV: ABRA) (OTCQX: ABBRF) (\"AbraSilver\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into subscription agreements in respect of a strategic C$20 million non-brokered private placement of AbraSilver common shares (\"Common Shares\") with Kinross Gold Corporation (\"Kinross\") (NYSE: KGC) (TSX: K) and an affiliate of Central Puerto SA (\"Central Puerto\") (NYSE: CEPU) at a subscription price of C$0.40 per Common Share (the \"Private Placement\").\n\nHighlights\n\nEach of Kinross and Central Puerto have entered into a subscription agreement with AbraSilver pursuant to which they will each invest C$10 million, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of C$20 million to the Company.  The Company will issue an aggregate of 50,000,000 Common Shares at a subscription price of C$0.40 per Common Share, representing approximately a 3% premium to the closing price of the Common Shares on April 19, 2024.  Upon closing of the Private Placement, Kinross and Central Puerto will each own approximately 4.0% of the outstanding Common Shares on an undiluted basis.  Following completion of the Private Placement, the Company plans to consolidate its Common Shares, on the basis of one (1) post-consolidation Common Share for every five (5) pre-consolidation Common Shares.  Upon closing of the Private Placement, AbraSilver will enter into an Investor Rights Agreement with each of Kinross and Central Puerto that includes, among other things, standard anti-dilution and equity participation rights and the formation of a Technical Advisory Committee and a Strategic & Operational Committee.  Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement with Kinross, AbraSilver and Kinross will form a regional partnership to jointly explore for and acquire new projects in Argentina focused on silver, gold, and copper.\n\nMr. John Miniotis, President and CEO of AbraSilver commented: \"We are very excited to welcome both Kinross and Central Puerto as important strategic shareholders and partners. Through this transaction, AbraSilver is well funded for a dual strategy to aggressively advance the Diablillos project towards a production decision and to accelerate our exploration efforts. The Company also gains access to the deep technical expertise in mineral exploration, mine development, and power generation. We look forward to working closely with our new partners as we embark upon the next stages of successfully advancing the development of our high-quality\u00a0Diablillos silver-gold project.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMr. Rob Bruggeman, Chairman of AbraSilver commented: \"The strategic investments by Kinross and Central Puerto represent a strong endorsement of the Diablillos project and our technical team. The exploration team has successfully grown Mineral Resources and Reserves at the Diablillos project and we look forward to unlocking additional value at Diablillos and, potentially, other projects in Argentina. We look ahead to leveraging the relationships with Kinross and Central Puerto as we continue to grow the Company.\"\n\nAll Common Shares issued in the Private Placement will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and a day from the date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities laws. Closing of the Private Placement is expected to occur on or about April 26, 2024 and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, approval by the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSX-V\").\n\nThe Company will use the proceeds of the Private Placement for exploration and development of the Company's flagship Diablillos project in Salta Province, Argentina (\"Diablillos\" or the \"Project\") and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nCentral Puerto is the largest private sector power generation company in Argentina, with a track record of more than 100 years in the energy industry.\n\nInvestor Rights Agreement\n\nUpon closing of the Private Placement, AbraSilver will enter into separate investor rights agreements (each, an \"Investor Rights Agreement\") with each of Kinross and Central Puerto, which provide, among other things, the grant of standard anti-dilution and equity participation rights.\n\nThe Investor Rights Agreement will also provide for the formation of a five-person Technical Advisory Committee comprised of two members from AbraSilver, two members from Kinross and one member from Central Puerto. The Technical Advisory Committee will provide advice and guidance on the upcoming Phase IV exploration campaign and the future development plans for Diablillos. Separately a Strategic & Operational Committee will be formed, comprised of two members from AbraSilver and two members from Central Puerto. The Strategic & Operational Committee will provide advice and guidance on strategic, operational, financial, tax, infrastructure, government and regulatory affairs, among others matters.\n\nFormation of Regional Partnership with Kinross in Argentina\n\nAbraSilver and Kinross aim to form a regional partnership to jointly explore for and acquire new projects in Argentina focused on silver, gold, and copper. Upon closing of the Private Placement,\u00a0AbraSilver will grant Kinross a Right of First Offer (the \"ROFO\") to acquire at least 50% of newly staked or acquired projects in Argentina beyond Diablillos. For any projects which Kinross elects to exercise its ROFO, Kinross and AbraSilver will establish an exploration program and budget, and enter into a joint venture agreement with standard funding and dilution mechanisms.\n\nShare Consolidation\n\nFollowing completion of the Private Placement, the Company is expected to complete a consolidation of its common shares, subject to TSX-V approval, on the basis of one (1) post-consolidation common share for every five (5) pre-consolidation common shares (the \"Consolidation\"). The Company's common shares will commence trading on a post-consolidated basis on a date to be determined in consultation with the TSX-V, which date will be announced in a subsequent news release once confirmed.

        "title": "3 Stocks Under $20 That Can Double Before the end of 2024",
        "content": "After trending lower recently, the S&P 500 index has been sideways for year-to-date. The recent market correction has been driven by potential rate-cut delays and escalated geopolitical tensions. This correction as a good buying opportunity. Undoubtedly, the first stocks to consider are undervalued blue chips, followed by high-quality growth stocks. At the same time, look at stocks under $20 that have a high beta and can deliver quick returns when the market sentiment changes.\n\nMy personal view is that tensions will deescalate in the Middle East. Further, rate cuts might be delayed, but expansionary policies are likely before the Presidential elections. The markets are, therefore, possible to stage a comeback.\n\nIt\u2019s, therefore, a good time to accumulate. This column focuses on stocks under $20 that are likely to double within the next few quarters.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith gold trading near $2,400 an ounce, gold miners will likely report stellar numbers in the next few quarters. Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) is an undervalued gold miner that trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17 and offers a dividend yield of 1.87%. In my view, KGC stock will likely double before the year\u2019s end.\n\nNote that the first-rate cut is likely before the Presidential elections. Therefore, the trend for gold will remain bullish. Further, high geopolitical tensions will support an upside in gold. Last year, Kinross reported operating cash flow of $1.7 billion.\n\nOCF will likely be more than $2 billion with a higher realized gold price. Further, with a liquidity buffer of $1.9 billion, Kinross is well-positioned to increase dividends and aggressively invest in exploration. Considering the financial flexibility, potential acquisition is also on the cards.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is possibly among the most undervalued Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners to buy. At $8.3, RIOT stock is poised to double in the next few months. Of course, the underlying assumption is that Bitcoin trends higher after the halving event. Impending rate cuts are also a positive catalyst for Bitcoin.\n\nOne reason to like Riot is its strong fundamentals. As of December, the ompany had a cash buffer of $290 million. Further, the value of Bitcoin holdings was $309 million. With a zero-debt balance sheet, Riot has ample flexibility for aggressive investments.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Riot reported a hash rate capacity of 12.4EH/s. By the end of the year, the company expects to increase capacity to 28.8EH/s and further to 38.1EH/s by 2025. The long-term target is to boost capacity to 100EH/s. Therefore, with massive expansion plans, Riot is positioned for stellar revenue and cash flow upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nEHang Holdings (EH) Flying taxi or Car-drone-EHang 216 exhibited by Prestige Image Motor Cars at the 2023 Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) at JIExpo Kemayoran. EH stock\n\nSource: Toto Santiko Budi / Shutterstock.com\n\nI am bullish on some of the best flying car stocks as companies move toward commercialization. EHang Holdings (NASDAQ:EH) is among the attractive names for a big rally. It\u2019s worth noting that EH stock has trended higher by 50% in the last 12 months. However, considering the growth potential in the next few years, the valuation remains attractive.\n\nIn an important development, the production certificate for its EH216-S eVTOL was obtained from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. This paves way for mass production of the eVTOL. It\u2019s worth noting that EHang has set a price of $410,000 for its eVTOL sales outside China.\n\nAn important point is that the company has set up an urban air mobility center in Japan and Spain. Further, the company has conducted thousands of trials in countries in Asia and Europe. The stage is set for massive expansion and order intake in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After testing investor patience for an extended period, gold has finally surged higher. Currently, the precious metal trades at all-time highs of $2,350 an ounce. The sentiments look bullish and it\u2019s a good time to look at gold stocks for profits.\n\nThere are multiple reasons that have supported the rally in gold. The most important factor is the possibility of multiple rate cuts in the coming quarters. Expansionary monetary policies translate into a weaker dollar, and hard assets surge higher.\n\nFurther, global geopolitical tensions have contributed to the increased interest in gold as an asset class. It\u2019s worth noting that central banks globally have continued to buy gold to diversify their reserves.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor gold mining companies, higher realized price will translate into EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside. This will provide ample headroom for dividend growth and aggressive capital investments. Therefore, let\u2019s discuss three gold mining stocks to buy that are likely to surge from attractive valuations.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) stock has recovered from lows of the year but remains sideways for year-to-date (YTD). This is a good opportunity to accumulate the undervalued precious metal stock before it surges higher. GOLD stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 18 and offers a dividend yield of 2.26%. Besides capital gains, I expect healthy upside in dividends in the coming quarters.\n\nAs of 2023, Barrick Gold reported proven and probable mineral reserves of 77 million ounces. Since the end of 2019, the company has delivered 140% reserve replacement. With quality gold assets comes clear revenue and cash flow visibility.\n\nAnother point to note is that Barrick Gold reported adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow of $5.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, for 2023. With higher realized prices, OCF and free cash flow will swell this year. Barrick Gold will be positioned to increase dividends, share repurchase and capital investments.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is another blue-chip gold stock to buy. In the last 12 months, NEM has declined by 21% and trades at a valuation gap. As gold surges, it\u2019s a matter of time before the stock delivers robust returns.\n\nAs of 2023, Newmont reported a strong asset base. This included 96.1 million ounces in gold reserves, 30 billion pounds of copper reserves and nearly 600 million ounces of silver reserves. With the acquisition of Newcrest, the company added 47 million ounces of gold reserves last year. This comes at the right time with significant EBITDA margin expansion is likely in coming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Newmont has an investment grade balance sheet. This provides flexibility for aggressive investments, and the company is positioned for steady growth in gold production. For the current year, Newmont has guided for 6.9 million gold ounces of production. Also, as cash flows increase, healthy dividend growth is likely.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nKinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) is among the relatively smaller gold mining companies that looks attractive. KGC stock has trended higher by 31% in the last 12 months but remains attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.5. Further, from a 2024 expected enterprise value to EBITDA perspective, KGC is undervalued as compared to Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation.\n\nAn important point to note is that Kinross Gold has a strong financial profile. The company ended 2023 with a liquidity buffer of $1.9 billion. Further, it\u2019s likely that operating cash flow for the year will be more than $2 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Kinross Gold had to sell Russian gold assets due to geopolitical factors. The company still has a sizeable gold reserve of 22 million ounces.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that with high financial flexibility, the company pursues acquisition to boost the production outlook. Currently, Kinross Gold has guided for stable gold production through 2026. However, as gold trends higher, it\u2019s likely that revenue growth will be robust coupled with free cash flow upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In recent days, the price of gold has risen above $2,300 per ounce for the first time, hitting an all-time high in the process. Spot gold is currently trading at a record high of $2,356.50 an ounce, so it makes sense that precious metals investors are turning their attention to gold stocks. Gold\u2019s price is marching higher on prospects for lower interest rates and as central banks around the world increase their stores of bullion. On April 3, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that stubborn inflation had not altered the overall picture for monetary policy moving forward, sending the price of gold jumping.\n\nGold benefits when interest rates fall as it reduces the opportunity cost of holding bullion. At the same time, central banks have been increasing their holdings of gold, which is viewed as a safe haven asset in times of geopolitical turmoil. Central banks have been buying more gold with military conflicts raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. Some analysts estimate that central bank buying has driven up the price of gold by as much as 25%. Investors looking for gold stocks to shine in their portfolios should check out these three with gilded gains.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) How to Play Barrick Gold Stock Ahead of Today's Earnings\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are a few reasons to like Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) right now. In February, the company announced a new $1 billion stock buyback program, which is positive for shareholders. News of the buyback came along with financial results that, while mixed, showed improvement at the company. The global mining firm reported earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents for the final quarter of 2023. That beat Wall Street forecasts of 21 cents. Revenue came in at $3.06 billion, below expectations of $3.08 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBarrick reported that its total gold production in 2023 rose 1.4% to 1.05 million ounces, while the average realized price per ounce increased 3% to $1,986 in Q4 of last year. In terms of forward guidance, Barrick Gold said that it anticipates higher gold production this year as prices for the precious metal reach record highs. Management said that they expect gold production to range between 3.9 million ounces and 4.3 million ounces this year, compared with 4.05 million ounces in 2023. Record prices should boost profits too.\n\nGOLD stock is down 6% over the last 12 months. However, the stunted trading might not last much longer, especially if the company\u2019s earnings continue to show improvement.\n\nNewmont Corp. (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nNewmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) is the world\u2019s largest gold miner. In business since 1921, the company today has operations stretching from its home base of Denver, Colo., all the way to Australia and many points in-between. NEM stock is a good one to own with the price of gold at an all-time high. Currently, there is a buy-the-dip opportunity with the company\u2019s share price down 1.3% so far in 2024. Shareholders also benefit from a quarterly dividend payment of 25 cents a share, giving the stock a yield of 2.54%.\n\nNEM stock has slumped since the American gold miner closed its $16.9 billion takeover of former Australian rival Newcrest Mining. While the deal cements Newmont\u2019s status as the the world\u2019s biggest gold company, some analysts questioned the timing of the acquisition and the purchase price, balking at Newmont\u2019s offer $21.37 per share, which represented a more than 30% premium to Newcrest\u2019s share price before the takeover was announced. Still, the purchase of Newcrest is expected to generate $500 million in synergies within the next two years.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) has been performing very well with spot gold prices at record highs. This year, KGC stock is up 9.6%. Over the past 12 months the share price has increased 30%. And over five years it has risen 87%. One of the 10 largest gold producers in the world, KGC stock has been on an upswing as the company ramps up its production levels and as its earnings show strength. This continued growth makes it one of the best gold stocks on the list.\n\nOwing to high gold prices, Kinross reported a fourth quarter 2023 profit from continuing operations of $65.4 million or six cents per share. That was a dramatic turnaround from a loss of $106 million or 8 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose 3.7% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.12 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $902.2 million. The company produced 546,513 ounces of gold in the final quarter of last year, also beating estimates.\n\nKinross expects its gold production to be approximately 2.1 million ounces this year, though it is aiming to increase production even more as it strives to make hay while the sun shines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In December 2021, the World Economic Forum reported on an investigation regarding the reasons for the decline in long-term investing. Some key reasons included the emergence of high-frequency machine trading, low fees & commissions, focus on short-term results and shorter company lifespans. It seems to be an era of stock trades rather than value investing.\n\nIn my personal view, the rewards for long-term investing remain exceptional. Massive wealth creation comes from holding quality stories with patience. At the same time, an active investor should not miss out on short-term trading opportunities.\n\nThere are dozens of examples every quarter where certain stocks have surged by 50% to 100%. Profits from successful stock trades can be allocated to long-term ideas. It also boosts overall portfolio returns to support the key objective of comfortably beating inflation \u2014 of course, beating index returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe focus of this column is on potential stock trades that can deliver at least 50% returns in Q2 2024. These returns are likely on industry or company-specific catalysts. I have avoided talking about purely speculative ideas and focused on fundamentals.\n\nKinross Gold (KGC) Cellphone with business logo of Canadian mining company Kinross Gold Corp. on screen in front of webpage.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGold has trended higher by almost 13% year-to-date and trades at $2,320 an ounce. In comparison, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC), a quality gold miner, has trended higher by just 6%. Clearly, KGC stock has been a laggard, but that\u2019s likely to change. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 20, the stock is attractively valued and poised for a big rally.\n\nI must add that gold will likely remain in an uptrend, with potential rate cuts coming in the second half of 2024. Kinross is, therefore, positioned to benefit from higher realized prices. Last year, Kinross reported operating cash flow of $1.7 billion. Given the upside in gold, the company is on track to deliver an operating cash flow of more than $2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat will translate into two positives. First, KGC stock has an attractive dividend yield of 1.88%. I expect healthy dividend growth that\u2019s likely to translate into stock re-rating. Further, Kinross ended 2023 with a liquidity buffer of $1.9 billion. Strong cash flows will add to the financial flexibility, and Kinross is positioned to make aggressive capital investments. Potential asset acquisitions might also be in the cards.\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR) Macro view of miner working for bitcoins mine pool. Devices and technology for mining cryptocurrency.

Crypto mining.\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nThere is little doubt that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will continue to dominate headlines in the coming quarters. That will either be because of the halving event or potential expansionary policies. Either way, the catalysts are in place for cryptocurrencies.\n\nAmong Bitcoin mining stocks, Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) looks attractive after remaining sideways for year-to-date. CIFR stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21 and will likely go ballistic in the coming months.\n\nIn terms of expansion, Cipher ended February with a hash rate of 7.4 EH/s. Steady expansion is expected in the coming quarters, with capacity likely to increase to 25.1EH/s in the first half of 2025.\n\nTherefore, the best part of growth is still to come, and Cipher has ample financial flexibility. As of February, the company reported a cash buffer of $69.4 million. Further, Cipher had 1,433 Bitcoin in its balance sheet which adds to the liquidity buffer. It\u2019s, therefore, a matter of time before CIFR stock skyrockets.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T.

From highs of $7.5 in August 2023, ACHR stock has corrected to current levels of $4.3. With the company on track for commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in 2025, the selling is overdone.\n\nIn the United States, Archer is constructing three conforming Midnight aircraft for certification and expects to complete 400 test flights in 2024. In the UAE, the company has joined hands with Falcon Aviation to develop a vertiport network in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Commercialization in the U.S. and UAE is due in 2025, with Indian operations likely to commence in 2026.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that Archer will pursue entry into new geographies in the coming quarters. It\u2019s worth noting that the company already has an order backlog of $3.5 billion. The backlog will likely swell and provide revenue visibility for 2025 and beyond. For now, successful flight testing and certification progress will serve as catalysts for ACHR stock trending higher from oversold levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 most profitable gold stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Gold Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe close of 2023 saw a surge in gold prices driven by the widespread belief that the precious metal serves as a hedge against inflation, prompting investors to seek refuge amid economic uncertainty. That same year, gold prices experienced a notable surge of over 13%, coinciding with a 3% increase in demand for the yellow metal compared to the previous year, reaching 4,899 metric tons. This data, sourced from the World Gold Council, encompasses purchases made by central banks as well as demand from various sectors including industries, jewelry makers, and investors. The SVB crash and conflicts in the Middle East have further heightened demand for the precious metal throughout the year, consequently leading gold stocks to achieve significant gains. According to a Bloomberg report from earlier in 2023, data from Invesco indicated a notable trend of global sovereign wealth funds and investors increasing their gold holdings. The insights from the report were based on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, managing assets totaling approximately $21 trillion.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the price of gold also recorded strong performances. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:GLD) saw a gain of 6.06% year-to-date, while the iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:IAU) climbed 4.6%. Many\u00a0analysts describe the investment environment supporting gold's recent performance as a Goldilocks scenario, characterized by \"just right\" conditions. Bill Baruch, president of commodities brokerage firm Blue Line Futures, suggesting that gold's movement signals the beginning of a \"multi-year bull market in metals.\" This statement is supported by VanEck's report that illustrated the direct correlation between gold prices and gold stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Gold stocks are supposed to outperform the metal when gold\u2019s price is rising. Their leverage to gold justifies outperformance. For any given move in the price of gold, operating cash flow generated by these companies increases (or decreases) by a much greater percentage. Take Alamos (8.06% of Fund net assets), for example. The company estimates that a 5% increase in the price of gold (about a+$100/oz move), would translate into an increase of almost 30% in their free cash flow in 2024. \"\n\nWith that in mind, today we will explore some of the most profitable gold stocks that investors should take note of, with prominent choices including Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM). 13 Most Profitable Gold Stocks To Invest In\n\nA golden nugget illuminated under direct lighting, hinting at the value of precious metals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable gold stocks to invest in, we narrowed down a list of gold companies that have operations involving the precious metal and ranked them according to their lates trailing twelve-month net income.

        "title": "Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold",
        "content": "In February, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) reported its fourth quarter and full-year results for 2023.\n\nBarrick Gold is one of my top four long-term gold miners, along with Newmont (NYSE:NEM), Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) and Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC). These companies should be the first choice for an average investor looking to make a long-term investment in gold.\n\nBased on a recent presentation, it was revealed that half of Barrick Gold's production comes from North America, with 13 gold mines and three copper mines.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Sign with AEM. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nAgnico Eagle and Kinross Gold have outperformed the VanEck Gold Miner ETF (GDX), rising 11% and 38% year over year, compared to the exchange-traded fund's 5% increase. Barrick Gold and Newmont, on the other hand, have continued to underperform, falling by 6% and 25% in a single year. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nThe spot price of gold ended at $2,156 an ounce on Friday. It should have driven gold stocks higher, but that is not happening. It proved the relationship between gold miners and the metal is not as strong as the correlation between oil producers and oil prices.\n\nGold prices have experienced a significant increase in the past six and a half years. In October 2018, the price was approximately $1,200 per ounce, and it has now climbed to $2,159, nearing an all-time high. Unfortunately, the mining industry has not followed the same trajectory.\n\nA variety of factors contributed to the mining industry's underperformance. We can identify a few intrinsic factors that could explain Barrick Gold's undervaluation.\n\nFirst, the number of favorable jurisdictions for gold mining has decreased over the last decade. Many previously safe jurisdictions in Asia, Africa and Latin America are now under threat. Political risks have resulted in a valuation decline that is difficult to reverse for companies like Barrick Gold, whose output is partially dependent on less favorable locations like West Africa.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarrick, for example, intends to resume operations at the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea. The mine has been under care and maintenance since 2020 due to the country's refusal to renew permits and renegotiate the agreement. With a 49% stake, Barrick is now the mine's operator.\n\nIt is the same issue that Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) encountered with its Grasberg gold and copper mine in Papua New Guinea. We can also recall the North Mara in Tanzania, which experienced numerous setbacks a few years ago before resuming production under a new agreement.\n\nOne of the company's main strategic priorities is to raise copper production. Lumwana's development is planned to produce 240,000 tons of copper annually. Additionally, the company is progressing with its Reko Diq project, which focuses on gold and copper production.\n\nThe project's capital expenditure is expected to be $7 billion, with a potential start date of 2025 and first production in 2028. It is a significant investment, but I have some reservations. Balochistan Province in Pakistan faces increasing security threats and local opposition to the project. The company seems intent to press on even though local tribes claim ownership of the site and the Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar insurgent organization warned it to stay away.\n\nAs a result, when investing in Barrick Gold, it is critical to consider these risk factors. Investors hesitant to expose themselves to high-risk companies should look into Agnico Eagle, which has a much safer asset portfolio, or Newmont, which is undervalued and owns good tier-1 assets.\n\nRegardless, CEO Mark Bristow clearly stated why the company's strategy will be successful and noted its 2023 reserves are an important indicator. He said during the fourth-quarter conference call:\n\n\"Highlights of the year were our sustained and industry-leading gold and copper reserve replacement, one of the key differentiators between Barrick and its peers.\"\n\nMineral reserves for 2023 are now 77 million ounces of gold, 5.6 million tons of copper and 170 million ounces of silver. This is much higher than Agnico Eagle's 53.8 million ounces of gold, 56.9 million ounces of silver and 0.7 million tons of copper.\n\nHowever, Newmont is the leading gold miner in reserves with 135.9 million ounces of gold, 596 million ounces of silver and 13.6 million tons of copper following the recent acquisition of Newcrest. Unfortunately, large mineral reserves are not a guarantee of success.\n\nFouth-quarter results snapshot and commentary\n\nBarrick's net earnings rose from a loss of $735 million, or 42 cents, in the same period last year to a profit of $479 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, in fourth-quarter 2023. Revenue rose from $2.77 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $3.06 billion. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nYearly revenue and production were slightly better than the preceding year, as shown below: Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nThe results exceeded analysts' expectations, indicating the company's production is expanding. I was pleasantly surprised by Nevada's mine production this quarter, which totaled 513,000 ounces of gold equivalent, up from 478,000 ounces in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe trailing 12-month free cash flow was $626 million, but was $136 million in the fourth quarter. I find it a little low. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nThe cash flow generated from operations was $997 million, higher than the previous year's $795 million. This capital expenditure was $861 million, slightly lower than the previous year.\n\nThe company is experiencing a positive impact due to the rise in gold prices and increased output. This trend is expected to continue as the current price of gold is more than $2,160 per ounce. Moreover, Barrick Gold is confident about producing a solid amount of gold equivalent production until 2033. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nOn Feb. 13, the board of directors authorized a new share buyback program to purchase up to $1 billion of Barrick's outstanding common shares over the next 12 months. The company did not buy back any shares in 2023.\n\nAccording to the company's dividend policy, Barrick Gold announced a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter, offering a 2.50% dividend yield.\n\nFinally, the debt situation has increased noticeably with $1.02 billion in net debt and a net debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 0.15. The chart below shows net debt is up slightly quarter over quarter. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nGold and copper production\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, 1,054,000 ounces of gold (1,042,000 ounces sold) and 113 million pounsd of copper (117 million pounds sold) were produced at a gold price of $1,971 per ounce. While gold production fell by 5.90% per year, copper production rose by 17.70%.\n\nThe realized average copper price was $3.78 per pound compared to $3.81 last year. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nGold production has steadily increased over the next four quarters and is expected to continue with the restart of the Porgera mine in the first quarter of 2024. Gold production per mine is indicated below: Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nAs for copper, the Lumwana mine did particularly well with 73 million pounds, up 1.50% quarter over quarter. The Lumwana feasibility study is on track for completion by the end of 2024. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nCopper production is likely to increase, with the price of copper increasing to $3.78 per pound this quarter. Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nTechnical analysis and commentary Better Times Are Ahead for Barrick Gold\n\nNote, the dividend is taken into account in the chart.\n\nGold follows a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $16 and support at $14.50. The relative strength index is now 57, insignificant enough to indicate a possible extended trend. The chart pattern is still descending, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, after a brief period of consolidation, it could signal a longer-term upward trend. Notice how the stock price retraced to the 50-day moving average, which is frequently used as a weak intermediate support.\n\nIt is recommended to keep a core long-term holding and allocate roughly 40% to LIFO trading while waiting for a potential final breakthrough in 2024, assuming gold prices stay between $2,150 and $2,200 per ounce.\n\nSelling between $15.90 and $16.25 is the recommended mid-term trading strategy; a higher resistance level at $16.75 might also be present. I recommend accumulating between $14.75 and $14, with a lower potential support at $13.75\n\nWarning: The TA chart must be updated frequently to be relevant. The chart above has a possible validity of about a week or two.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Kinross Gold Corporation's (TSE:K) Financials Are Too Obscure To Link With Current Share Price Momentum: What's In Store For the Stock?",
        "content": "Kinross Gold's (TSE:K) stock is up by a considerable 9.7% over the past month. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Kinross Gold's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Kinross Gold\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Kinross Gold is:\n\n6.7% = US$415m \u00f7 US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every CA$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn CA$0.07 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nKinross Gold's Earnings Growth And 6.7% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Kinross Gold's ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 9.4% either. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 12% seen by Kinross Gold was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, when we compared Kinross Gold's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 28% in the same period. This is quite worrisome. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Kinross Gold's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Kinross Gold Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nWhen we piece together Kinross Gold's low three-year median payout ratio of 18% (where it is retaining 82% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nMoreover, Kinross Gold has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 27% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we have mixed feelings about Kinross Gold. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Kinross Gold (KGC). Shares have added about 9.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Kinross Gold due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nKinross' Earnings and Sales Surpass Estimates in Q4\n\nKinross recorded a fourth-quarter 2023 profit from continuing operations of $65.4 million or 6 cents per share. This compares favorably with a loss of $106 million or 8 cents incurred in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe company reported adjusted earnings of 11 cents per share, up from the prior-year quarter figure of 9 cents.

It topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $902.2 million.\n\nOperational Performance\n\nThe company produced 546,513 gold equivalent ounces from continuing operations in the reported quarter, down 8.3% year over year. The figure topped our estimate of 501,971 gold equivalent ounces.\n\nAverage realized gold prices were $1,974 per ounce in the quarter, up 14% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure. The figure beat our estimate of $1,844 per ounce.\n\nThe production cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce was $976, up 15.1% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s levels. This outpaced our estimate of $913. The all-in-sustaining cost per gold equivalent ounce sold rose roughly 9.5% year over year to $1,353. This missed our estimate of $1,367.\n\nMargin per gold equivalent ounce sold was $998 in the quarter, up from the prior-year quarter\u2019s $883.\n\n2023 Results\n\nEarnings, as adjusted, for full-year 2023 were 44 cents per share compared with 22 cents a year ago. Net sales climbed 22.7% year over year to $4,239.7 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancials\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $352.4 million at the end of the year, down around 15.7% year over year. Long-term debt was $2,232.6 million at the end of the quarter, down about 12.7%.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, Kinross expects production to be 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces (+/- 5%).

However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, Kinross Gold has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best single digit stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our coverage of affordable stocks and how they, like all other stocks such as small cap and large cap stocks, benefit and suffer from the broader macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In.\n\nStocks can broadly be classified into three categories based on their market capitalization. Each of these represents firms whose shares operate with different dynamics within the broader market climate. The three primary stock categories are small, mid, and large caps, with the passage of time that has seen trillion dollar valuations the likes of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also created new categories commonly called mega cap stocks.\n\nSimilarly, the proliferation of computing products across the financial industry has made stock trading easier, leading to thousands of firms in categories such as micro and nano cap stocks. These stocks, which include firms whose shares trade in the single digits, are on the more 'affordable' end of the spectrum in literal terms. Single digit stocks are a small upgrade over the broader category of well known stocks that are called penny stocks. Typically, these stocks refer to firms whose shares trade below $5, and when we consider the general benefits and drawbacks of investing, single digit stocks, and penny stocks follow the same rules.\n\nBoth offer a higher potential for larger percentage returns via share price appreciation. Similarly, since penny stocks and single digit stocks belong to companies that receive little media coverage, the potential of scammers exploiting unwitting investors is high. This is because during the initial stage of a 'pump' during a typical scam, the shares of a single digit or penny stock appreciate much faster than the media can respond to determine if the performance is driven by underlying fundamentals or other legitimate tailwinds. Then, as more investors pile on, should the price drop, then most people end up losing their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, where there's risk there's a reward, and one key advantage that single digit stocks have over penny stocks is that since they also include firms whose shares trade between $5 and $10, the opportunities from profiting also increase with the growing comfort of a heftier share price. Additionally, another key benefit that is rather exclusive to single digit stocks is that they can often involve the shares of well established and sizeable foreign entities who also make their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) available for trading on American stock markets.\n\nThis trend is present predominantly in the banking sector, with foreign or ex-US banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG), Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG), and Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN) being apt examples. Each of these is a major player in the financial systems of their countries, with a role similar to U.S. banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).\n\nTherefore, investing in single digit stocks offers a chance of stability as well as profit taking. Continuing with our example of single digit banking stocks, MUFJ's shares are up by a respectable 16% year to date, despite the fact that Japan's economy, like other developed peers such as the United Kingdom and Germany, is not performing well. Similarly, even though Britain is officially in recession territory, Lloyd's stock has shed just 6% over the past twelve months and had the shares not dropped in January, then just like the British economy, the stock would also be nearly flat in growth terms.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best single digit stocks, it's important to also keep in mind recent stock market and economic news. With NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s blockbuster earnings out of the way, investors will now focus on interest rates and U.S. GDP growth - both of which are quite interlinked. Starting with the latter, S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), ahead of its flagship S&P 500 crossing the coveted 5,000 point barrier and setting a new record, also upgraded its forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2024. The ratings agency now believes that the American economy will grow by 2.4% in 2024, for a significant upward revision over the previous estimate of 1.5%. As this would hint on its own, the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes also show that the central bank is worried about cutting rates too soon rather than too late.\n\nSo, with single digit stocks offering the promise of returns and stability, we decided to look at what stocks hedge funds are buying. Some notable picks are Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG). 12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close up of hands counting a vast stack of money in a bank vault.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best single digit stocks to buy, we ranked the 60 most valuable single digit stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of December 2023. Out of these, the single digit stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were chosen.\n\nFor these best single digit stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\n12. Garrett Motion Inc.

        "title": "Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K) Pays A US$0.03 Dividend In Just Four Days",
        "content": "Kinross Gold Corporation (TSE:K) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Kinross Gold's shares on or after the 5th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.03 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.12 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Kinross Gold has a trailing yield of approximately 2.5% on its current stock price of CA$6.50. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Kinross Gold has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Kinross Gold\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Kinross Gold paid out a comfortable 35% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 37% of its free cash flow in the past year.\n\nIt's positive to see that Kinross Gold's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Kinross Gold's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 12% a year over the previous five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Kinross Gold has seen its dividend decline 2.8% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs Kinross Gold an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Kinross Gold has comfortably low cash and profit payout ratios, which may mean the dividend is sustainable even in the face of a sharp decline in earnings per share. Still, we consider declining earnings to be a warning sign. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Kinross Gold from a dividend perspective.\n\nIn light of that, while Kinross Gold has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Kinross Gold that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

If you want to skip our discussion on the latest stock market landscape, head over to 5 $10 Stocks That Will Triple.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the global outlook for securities markets in 2024 suggests a more positive scenario compared to the previous year, with expectations of easing inflation and interest rates. Investors expect central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to lower interest rates, but concerns persist about potential disruptions from geopolitical tensions, supply chain issues, and strong growth leading to inflation spikes. The technology and health care sectors are performing well globally, with positive long-term trends supporting their growth.\n\nIn the corporate sphere, merger and acquisition activity is on the rise, doubling last year's pace, driven by reduced macroeconomic uncertainty, lower interest rates, and higher equity valuations. JPMorgan noted that the technology and healthcare sectors are rallying due to strong earnings and supportive long-term trends. The healthcare sector, which experienced negative earnings growth last year, is expected to rebound, with the worst seemingly over. M&A activity is also expected to continue, supported by a favorable economic environment, as evidenced by notable deals such as the Synopsys and ANSYS software tie-up, BlackRock's acquisition of Global Infrastructure Management, and Sekisui House's purchase of MDC Holdings. Overall, the macroeconomic backdrop of stable inflation, declining policy rates, and robust corporate earnings growth is seen as favorable for multi-asset portfolios, providing a constructive environment despite uncertainties in specific trends.\n\nIn 2023, market timing proved challenging as investors initially sold stocks despite a 17% rally in the S&P 500 by mid-year, as perBlackrock\u2019sMarket Insights. Flows into stocks resumed in November, coinciding with a 14% S&P 500 increase through year-end. Bond commitment persisted throughout most of the year, but $22 billion flowed out during late summer/fall as the 10-year Treasury note peaked at 4.99% in October. In 2024, both stocks and bonds may find success with easing inflation and a pivot in Fed policy. Resilient growth could benefit stocks, while falling interest rates may favor bonds. However, cash may become less attractive with anticipated Fed rate cuts. Potential winners include smaller cap US quality companies, healthcare, financials, and opportunities in India, Mexico, and Japan, with the possibility of a surprising market leader emerging, similar to AI names in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of December 2023, the US equity market, based on a composite of over 700 stocks on US exchanges, has been trading at a price/fair value of 1.00, indicating alignment with fair value estimates. Anticipating a year of economic recovery and normalization in 2024 after the disruptions caused by the pandemic, there are still undervalued opportunities with substantial safety margins. Small-cap stocks are particularly attractive, at a 16% discount, followed by mid-caps at 6%, while large caps are slightly above fair value. According to Morningstar, small-cap stocks, experiencing significant discounts compared to larger counterparts, are poised for outperformance in 2024. Previous concerns about small-cap viability during the pandemic have eased, and despite pressure related to rising interest rates, the stage is set for small caps to excel. The forecast for 2024 and 2025 includes a more normalized economic environment, alleviating solvency fears for small caps, and a decline in interest rates, mitigating refinancing risks.\n\nSome of the stocks that market experts expect will triple include Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR), and Caribou Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRBU).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe chose consensus picks of credible websites and compiled a list of stocks priced $10 or less that are expected to triple.

The company owns a 100% interest in the Thacker Pass project situated in northern Nevada and has investments in exploration properties in both the United States and Canada. On December 12, 2023, J.P. Morgan analysts initiated coverage of Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) stock with a Neutral rating.

(NYSE:LAC), same as the prior quarter.\n\nMassif Capital made the following comment about Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the first quarter, Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) had several positive events, including a favorable record of decision ruling for Thacker Pass, paving the way for construction of the mine to start, a revised Thacker resource/cost estimates, and GM\u2019s financing/offtake agreement. Even though LAC is non-producing and its stock is down 34% over the past year (compared to the larger lithium producer\u2019s 3%), the stock remains one of our favorites with multiple catalysts (and still up roughly 600% from our initial purchase price):\n\nAs Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina and Thacker Pass come online, volumes will effectively be marked at leading-edge pricing. As such, it seems prudent to continue underwriting growth, especially given the firm\u2019s experienced management team with a visible pipeline to incremental supply before 2025. These qualities make one or both post-separation entities attractive buyout targets for numerous suitors\u2026\u201d (Please click here to read the full text)\n\n7. ESSA Pharma Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the12 Best Gold Stocks Under $25. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Gold Stocks Under $25.\n\nGold prices slipped recently amid indications from several Fed officials that the central bank won't show haste in cutting interest rates as inflation continues to remain stubborn. Gold prices reacted to this development negatively as historically a low-rate environment bodes well for the precious metal. However, long-term investors believe gold remains a solid option since sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates and there are several other catalysts that make gold stocks worth buying.\n\nAccording to a report by World Gold Council, gold consumption in 2023 increased by about 3% to 4,899 tons, fueled by massive central bank buying and demand from OTC markets.\n\nDemand of gold in China has been a significant catalyst for the precious metal as people turn to the precious metal because of its intrinsic value amid a decline in property prices and other investment options. A Bloomberg report earlier this month cited Nikos Kavalis, managing director at consultancy Metals Focus Ltd, who said that the difficulty to move your money out of China and lack of alternatives are giving a boost to gold in the country.\n\nSome other catalysts for gold stocks like Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) and B2Gold Corp (NYSE:BTG) include investors' wish to continuously diversify their portfolios for troubled economic times and stay invested in safe-haven assets. A report by State Street Gobal Advisors said that gold has historically delivered positive risk-adjusted returns in the past, with a 7.7% compound annual growth rate in USD terms since 15 August, 1971.\n\nBut does strengths in gold prices help gold stocks? A report by investment management company VanEck analyzed some data to show that gold prices are directly linked to gold stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Gold stocks are supposed to outperform the metal when gold\u2019s price is rising. Their leverage to gold justifies outperformance. For any given move in the price of gold, operating cash flow generated by these companies increases (or decreases) by a much greater percentage. Take Alamos (8.06% of Fund net assets), for example. The company estimates that a 5% increase in the price of gold (about a+$100/oz move), would translate into an increase of almost 30% in their free cash flow in 2024. \"\n\nHowever, the report noted that over the past two years there has been a disconnect noted between gold prices and gold stocks, mainly due to central bank buying and several other factors of temporary nature. Best Gold Stocks Under $25\n\nA closeup view of a large gold mine, illustrating the company's gold properties. Methodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge funds and picked gold stocks trading under $25 with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best gold stocks under $25 according to smart money managers. But why care about what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n12. Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nWith a low PE ratio and a dividend yield of about 2.8%, gold mining company Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) ranks 12th in our list of the best gold stocks under $25.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2024, 13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI).

Revenue in the quarter jumped 131.3% year over year to $385.39 million.\n\nOf the 910 funds in Insider Monkey's database, 14 hedge funds had stakes in SSR Mining Inc (NASDAQ:SSRM).\n\nPalm Valley Capital Management made the following comment about SSR Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:SSRM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe did not fully sell any positions during the third quarter. We purchased four new names: Avista Corporation (ticker: AVA), Farmland Partners (ticker: FPI), Equity Commonwealth (ticker: EQC), and\u00a0SSR Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:SSRM). We believe these opportunities materialized because higher interest rates are disproportionately impacting investor sentiment toward certain sectors, even as capitalization-weighted, tech-heavy indexes have powered through the headwinds.\n\nSSR Mining is back in the Fund after a brief hiatus. SSR is a precious metals producer with four mines located in the United States, Turkey, Canada, and Argentina. The company is selling at a meaningful discount to its tangible book value and our calculated net asset value.

Along with Osisko\u2019s high precious metal exposure, especially diamonds no longer serving as a major GEO contributor, our company continues to distinguish itself from pure leading jurisdictional exposure as it relates to both production and NAV to what Osisko defines as Tier 1 mining jurisdictions, which include Canada, the United States and Australia. Recent global events have only served to underpin our belief that maintaining a high exposure to both Tier 1 and very well-established mining jurisdictions where mining has been a key industry or part of the overall culture is extremely important. As stated in our press release last night, after joining the team and subsequently going through a full portfolio review, in addition to factoring events that have transpired over the past years since this company last published it\u2019s 2023 guidance and previous five-year outlook, the company has updated these numbers to reflect what we believe to be achievable ranges.\n\nWith respect to our 2024 guidance of 82,000 to 92,000 GEOs, it goes without saying that there is a significant void in terms of GEOs that has been left by the shutdown of or not. Production improvements and new mine startups, plus the CSA copper stream coming online for us on June 15th are expected to partially offset this reduction. However, cornerstone asset, Canadian Malartic is guided to be flat to maybe modestly down year over year in large part, because of Ignyta\u2019s decision to defer the reintroduction of progression lower grade ore to increase mill throughput, which is now not expected to happen until 2025 In 2024, Mill throughput is expected to be sourced primarily from the Barnat pit, as well as the Odyssey underground and to a lesser extent, with total throughput estimated to be 52,000 tonnes per day in 2024 versus a nameplate capacity of 60,000 tonnes per day.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Gold Stocks Under $25.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation 12 Highest Quality Gold Plated Chains in the US 10 Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "White Gold Corp.\n\nFigure 1 - QV Regional Location Map Figure 1 - QV Regional Location Map\n\nFigure 2 - QV Soils + Property Overview Figure 2 - QV Soils + Property Overview\n\nFigure 3 - QV 2023 Soil Figure 3 - QV 2023 Soil\n\nFigure 4 - QV-Magnetics Overview Figure 4 - QV-Magnetics Overview\n\nTORONTO, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce that a soil sampling survey completed during the 2023 field season has identified a new 1 km long gold-in-soil anomaly on the QV property, located approximately 9 km northwest of the VG deposit which remains open for expansion (Figures 1 & 2). Soil sampling results range from trace up to a maximum of 496.7 ppb Au with associated anomalous tellurium. The new soil geochemical anomaly appears to be similar in character to the VG deposit and the Golden Saddle deposit which form part of the Company\u2019s flagship White Gold Project. The White Gold Project is located in west-central Yukon, Canada, and comprises 16 million tonnes averaging 2.23 g/t Au for 1,152,900 ounces of gold in the Indicated Resource category and 19 million tonnes averaging 1.54 g/t Au for 942,400 ounces of gold in the Inferred Resource category(1). These results form part of the Company\u2019s 2023 exploration program on its extensive and underexplored land package in the emerging White Gold District, Yukon, supported by strategic partners including Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC).\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the successful soil survey program which has identified a large new target on the QV property in close proximity to our existing deposit. The strike length, continuity, and similarities of the soil anomaly relative to the surface geochemical signatures of our Golden Saddle and VG deposits represents an exciting new target. Our data driven exploration methodology which has now led to multiple significant gold discoveries in the district, continues to demonstrate the prospectivity of our underexplored district scale exploration portfolio in the Yukon where we are still just scratching the surface, and the expansiveness of gold mineralization in this tier 1 mining district,\u201d stated David D\u2019Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaps and images accompanying this news release can be found at http://whitegoldcorp.ca/investors/exploration-highlights/.\n\nHighlights\n\n2023 soil sampling survey on the QV property focused on two grids located east and west of Chris Creek (East and West grid) and approximately 9 km northwest of the VG deposit, which hosts an open pittable Inferred resource of 287,100 oz gold at 1.53 g/t(1) and remains open along strike and at depth. The soil sampling program consisted of approximately 200 samples collected at 50 m sample spacings on 100 m-spaced survey lines. Gold values range from < 0.5 ppb Au to a maximum of 496.7 ppb Au, with 10 samples on the East Grid returning greater than 50 ppb Au in the range of 51.1 to 327 ppb Au. The gold anomaly is associated with anomalous tellurium and low arsenic in soils, which represents a surface geochemical signature similar to the VG and Golden Saddle deposits. The newly identified east-west trending soil anomaly on the East Grid measures approximately 1 km in length and is open along strike to the east and west beyond the limits of current soil sampling. Magnetic data indicates that the newly identified gold soil anomalies occur in a NNW-SSE trending mafic belt. Infill and extension soil sampling, GT-probe bedrock sampling, and ground magnetics and VLF-EM geophysical surveys are recommended to further advance this new target to drill-ready status in 2024.\n\nPDAC 2024\r\nThe Company will be exhibiting at PDAC 2024 at the Investors Exchange, with full details below. Conference attendees are invited to visit the Company booth to learn more and ask any questions they may have. Management is also participating in the PDAC One on One Meeting Program. Interested parties are encouraged to book a meeting through the conference website.\n\nBooth Number: 2312\r\nDates: March 3rd to 6th, 2024\r\nExhibition Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET\r\nOne on One Meetings: https://www.precioussummit.com/event/pdac-2024-one-on-one-meeting-program/\n\n2023 Soil Sampling Program \u2013 QV Property\n\nThe 2023 soil survey comprised approximately 200 samples on two grids located east (East Grid) and west (West Grid) of Chris Creek (Figure 3). Soil samples were collected at 50 m sample spacings on 100 m-spaced survey lines. Gold values range from less than detection limit (< 0.5 ppb Au) to a maximum of 496.7 ppb Au. The new soil anomaly on the East Grid generally strikes east-west and appears to display a sinistral offset of approximately 250 m part way along its length. Ten (10) samples from the anomaly returned greater than 50 ppb Au in the range of 51.1 to 327 ppb Au. The anomaly also has associated anomalous tellurium. Arsenic in soil values is low, and overall, the signature of the anomaly appears to be similar to the VG deposit and the Golden Saddle deposit suggesting a similar style of mineralization. The strike length of the new soil anomaly is generally comparable to that of the VG deposit anomaly, which remains open along strike to the east and west.\n\nThe maximum gold value from the 2023 soil sampling of 496.7 ppb Au is located on the westernmost survey line on the West Grid. No sampling has been conducted west of this sample and the significance and strike extent of this anomaly is currently unknown.\n\nMagnetic data reveal that the newly identified soil anomaly is situated near a mafic belt with a NNW-SSE orientation, similar to the structural context of the Ryan\u2019s Surprise deposit located approximately 15 km to the SSE. This mafic belt is interpreted to be positioned in the hanging wall of a NNW-SSE-oriented, district-scale fault system, intersected by a significant NE-trending fault, comparable to the structural array at Ryan\u2019s Surprise. The principal gold anomaly is localized at this fault intersection, associated with a semi-circular magnetic high approximately 1 km in diameter.\n\nNext Steps The Company is encouraged by the size and continuity of the new gold-in-soil anomaly, as well as its geochemical similarity to soil anomalies associated with the VG and Golden Saddle deposits. Additional infill soil sampling at 25 m spacings, extension soil sampling along strike, GT-Probe bedrock interface sampling and ground magnetics and VLF-EM geophysical surveying is being planned to further advance and evaluate the target for drill testing.\n\nAbout the QV Property\n\nThe QV property comprises 1003 quartz claims which over an area of 19,671 hectares and hosts the VG deposit, which hosts an open pittable Inferred resource of 287,100 oz gold at 1.53 g/t(1) and forms part of the Company\u2019s flagship White Gold Project. The mineralization is hosted along a N-E trending, gently south dipping structural zone that has been traced for over 700m at surface and consists of disseminated to vein-controlled pyrite with brecciation, stockwork quartz-carbonate veining, and sericite alteration. The VG shares strong similarities to the Golden Saddle deposit located 11 km south of the VG deposit on the White Gold property both in structural setting as well as mineralization style and is open along strike and at depth. The property also hosts several other prospective targets which have received limited exploration work and offer potential for additional discoveries.\n\nSoil Sampling Methods and Analysis\n\nThe 2023 QV property soil geochemistry survey was contracted to GroundTruth Exploration Inc. of Dawson City, Yukon. Field technicians navigated to pre-planned sample sites using handheld GPS units and collected C-Horizon soil samples using an Eijklcamp brand hand auger at a depth of between 20 cm and 110 cm. Typically, 400 to 500 g of soil is placed in a pre-labeled bag, and a field duplicate sample is taken once every 25 samples. The GPS location of the sample site is recorded with the GPS unit, and the waypoint location is labeled with the project name and the sample identification number. A weather-proof handheld device equipped with a barcode scanner is used in the field to record the descriptive attributes of the sample collected, including sample identification number, soil colour, soil horizon, slope, sample depth, ground and tree vegetation, sample quality, and any other relevant information.\n\nAnalytical work for the 2023 soil geochemistry surveys was carried out at Bureau Veritas (BV) Canada, with preparation completed at their Whitehorse, YT facility and analysis at their hub laboratory located in Vancouver, BC. All soil samples were assayed for gold and a 37 multi-element suite using 0.25g aqua-regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis (Code AQ201).

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best gold mining stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of gold and minerals, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest In According to Analysts.\n\nGold serves as a safe-haven investment, sought by investors to mitigate risks associated with factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and financial instability. These variables often contribute to gold price volatility, as witnessed in 2022 and early 2023. Gold surged to over $2,000 per ounce during this period due to concerns regarding inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. However, the market experienced significant price fluctuations as investors evaluated the possibility of a recession against the backdrop of increasing interest rates, inflation, and other dynamics.\n\nA Bloomberg report released earlier in 2023 unveiled a notable trend among global sovereign wealth funds and investors toward accumulating gold. Invesco's analysis was based on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively managing assets totaling around $21 trillion. The report underscored the sentiment surrounding gold, noting that \"a significant portion of central banks express concerns about the precedent set by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) agreeing that this event has heightened the appeal of gold.\" The survey findings underscored gold's enduring role as an inflation hedge, with a considerable number of central banks indicating intentions to bolster their gold reserves over the next three years.\n\nAmidst forecasts of persistent upward trends in gold prices fueled by geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, Netherlands-based ING Group predicts a continuation of the surge witnessed in 2023 into 2024. The initial surge in gold prices followed the outbreak of conflict in Israel earlier in the year, and despite tensions easing, prices have remained high. ING Group anticipates that the Federal Reserve will begin reducing interest rates in May 2024, with a total expected reduction of 150 basis points throughout the year, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. These rate cuts are forecasted to bolster gold prices in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering this outlook, let's explore some of the best gold mining stocks to invest in according to analysts, which include the likes of Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM).

        "content": "Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 15, 2024\n\nKinross Gold Corporation isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good morning. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kinross Gold's Fourth Quarter and Year End Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn, the conference over to Chris Lichtenheldt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris, you may begin your conference.\n\nChris Lichtenheldt: Thank you, and good morning. With us today, we have Paul Rollinson, President and CEO, and from the Kinross Senior Leadership Team, Andrea Freeborough, Claude Schimper, Will Dunford, and Geoff Gold. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, which may lead to actual results differing from estimates contained in our forward-looking information, please refer to Page 2 of this presentation. Our news release dated February 14, 2024. The MD&A for the period ended December 31, 2023, and our most recently filed AIF, all of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Paul.\n\nPaul Rollinson: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, discuss our outlook for the business going forward, and review our achievements in the area of ESG. I will then hand the call over to Andrea, to discuss our financial performance and guidance, Claude to review our operating performance, and Will to discuss our projects, exploration initiatives, and resource update. Looking back, we have a strong 2023, and successfully delivered on our targets and are well-positioned for another strong year ahead. Our operations are performing well. Our projects are advancing on schedule and on budget. Our exploration program, is delivering value.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe are generating substantial free cash flow, and our balance sheet is in excellent condition, and continues to delever. With respect to the fourth quarter, we had a strong finish to the year, resulting in full year production in the top half of our guidance range, and costs at the low end of our guidance range. A strong performance on costs was primarily driven by transparency on inflation that was incorporated into our targets. Our focus on operational performance, with strong production contributing to cost results and favorable trends on grade within our portfolio as we ramped up higher grade operations. As always, we will remain focused on cost control in 2024. However, we are expecting a modest increase, which Andrea will discuss shortly.\n\nThe strong performance on cost was underpinned by our three highest margin assets, Tasiast, La Coipa and Paracatu. Tasiast and Paracatu, are two top tier assets together accounted for approximately 1.2 million ounces. Adding in La Coipa, these three assets accounted for just over two-thirds of our production and an AISC of approximately $1,000 per ounce. At Tasiast, we deliver record throughput, and strong production in Q4, driving record full year production. Tasiast was our largest production contributor for the full year. Tasiast, was also our highest margin mine, and largest free cash flow generator in 2023. At Latin America Coipa, we also saw very strong margins and free cash flow. We are pleased with how the operation is performing. At Paracatu, we had another year of steady production highlighted, by strong mill performance and record recoveries.\n\nAnd while Q4 grades were lower as planned, it was the highest throughput quarter in recent years. In the US, we delivered a successful year with both production and costs across the U.S. operations, performing well against our targets. At Round Mountain, we approved the Phase S open pit expansion, securing strong production through the decade and bringing clarity to the future at Round Mountain. Also at Round Mountain, we are making good progress on our planned next stages of production, Phase X underground and the Gold Hill satellite opportunity. Turning now to projects, our mill expansion at Tasiast and restart of La Coipa are completed in 2023, as was the construction of our solar power plant at Tasiast. In Alaska, construction of the Manh Choh project is essentially complete and is on budget and on schedule for initial high-grade production in the second half of the year.\n\nAt Great Bear, we continue to make excellent progress. Looking back to the time of the acquisition just two years ago, we started with no declared resources. Today, we have approximately 2.8 million ounces of high-grade M&I and an incremental 3.3 million of high-grade inferred ounces. In 2023, we added more than 1 million ounces of growth to the LP underground resource from the initial resource we declared last year, which continues to support our view of a large, long-life, high-grade mining complex. Additionally, we continue to hit new high-grade intercepts. As outlined in yesterday's release, we recently intersected nearly 390 grams per ton across a true width of 3.5 meters at a vertical depth of nearly a kilometer. I would note that this hole was not captured in our year-end resource update.\n\nOngoing drilling on the property continues to demonstrate that this is a world-class deposit in a Tier 1 location. In addition to drilling success, other areas of the project are also advancing well, which Will is going to elaborate on later on this call. Before moving to our outlook, I'd like to comment on our year-end reserve and resource update. As expected, our year-end reserves decreased over the prior year, primarily due to depletion. As work advances on our new projects, we are upgrading the quality of our resource through the addition of higher margin ounces. Our measured and indicated resources remain stable at year-end at approximately 26 million ounces, while our inferred resources grew by approximately 1 million ounces, driven by the substantial increase at Great Bear.\n\nMoving to our outlook, we are reaffirming our stable production profile. 2024 is expected to resemble last year with production in CapEx, at similar levels. However, costs are expected to increase modestly, as a result of inflation. Production mix and mine sequencing. Our production outlook for 2025 of 2 million ounces remains consistent with previous guidance, and we are introducing another year of production guidance at 2 million ounces in 2026. Looking further ahead, we continue to expect production to remain around the 2 million ounce level, through the end of the decade. Maintaining production at this level, will require the approval of some of our pipeline projects, including underground opportunities at Round Mountain and Curlew, and open pit mine life extensions at La Coipa.\n\nWe will continue to advance these initiatives and will update you on our progress as we move forward. With respect to capital allocation, we remain focused on debt repayment. We reduced our debt level in 2023, and our balance sheet is in excellent shape. We believe a continuation of debt reduction remains an optimal use of excess cash. We will also continue paying our competitive dividend of $0.03 per share quarterly. Before turning over to Andrea, I'd like to comment on some of our achievements in ESG. In 2023, we once again demonstrated a strong commitment, to ESG by operating responsibly and advancing our strategy, across this important area. Our 2023 Sustainability and ESG Report, which we will publish in May, will provide a detailed review on our ESG performance and initiatives throughout the year.\n\nSome highlights from this past year include the construction of the solar power plant at Tasiast, which helps move us closer to our goal of reducing emissions intensity by 30% by 2030. In the area of social, we made approximately $10 million of monetary, and in-kind contributions through site investments, including to the University of Atacama's research station near our La Coipa mine in Chile, and establishing the Kinross Alaska Future Leaders Scholarship at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The goal of this scholarship, is to advance the inclusion of underrepresented people, within the resource industry. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrea.\n\nAndrea Freeborough: Thanks, Paul. This morning, I'll review financial highlights from the quarter and full year, provide an overview of our balance sheet, and discuss our guidance and outlook. As Paul noted, we finished the year with production of just over 2.1 million ounces, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. In the fourth quarter, we produced 547,000 ounces. Q4 sales of 565,000 ounces were slightly above production, due to timing. Our Q4 cost of sales of $976 per ounce and AISC of $1,353 per ounce, were higher, compared to the prior quarter, as expected, primarily due to lower production at Paracatu. Full year cost of sales of $942 per ounce was below the $970 guidance midpoint, driven by strong cost performance across the portfolio.\n\nCosts of Paracatu were on plan in 2023, and are expected to increase in 2024 due to lower planned production. Margins were strong at $998 per ounce sold in Q4 and $1,003 per ounce sold for the full year. Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.11 in Q4, and $0.44 for the full year. Adjusted operating cash flow, was $407 million in Q4, and approximately $1.7 billion, for the full year. Attributable CapEx, was $298 million in Q4, and $1.05 billion, for the full year. Attributable free cash flow in Q4, was $117 million, and for the full year was $560 million. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the year having further strengthened our financial position. After repaying $190 million of debt in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $350 million in cash and approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity.\n\nOur net debt improved to $1.9 billion at year end, from $2 billion at Q3. We repaid the $50 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility in October, and then the $140 million balance on our Tasiast loan in December. The Tasiast loan was repaid early with cash generated from the Tasiast operation, resulting in interest savings of approximately $35 million, assuming current rates, over the original term to 2027. Our trailing 12-month net debt to EBITDA ratio, continued to trend lower as we finished the year just above one-time. In 2023 as a whole, we reduced our total debt by approximately $360 million. As Paul mentioned, we aimed to further delever our balance sheet in 2024, as we plan to allocate excess free cash generated this year, against the 2025 term loan.\n\nThe term loan will be re-classified to current in our Q1 financials given its maturity in March 2025. Turning to our guidance and outlook, as Paul indicated, 2024 is expected to look similar to 2023, as our portfolio continues to generate, strong and stable returns. We are forecasting production in the range of 2.1 million ounces, remaining consistent year over year. For costs, we're guiding $1,020 per ounce for cost of sales, and $1,360 per ounce, for all-in sustaining costs. Expected cost of sales, of $1,020 per ounce, is up approximately 5%, compared with our $970 per ounce guidance from 2023. The expected increase is driven by three factors. Modest inflation, which has subsided, compared with recent years, but has not gone away. Sales mix with slightly more of our production coming from our U.S. operations, which operate with higher costs, and a temporarily lower production, and therefore higher cost year, compared to [Curlew] mine plan.\n\nAttributable capital expenditures guidance of $1.05 billion for 2024, is in line with 2023. Approximately $550 million of this CapEx is expected to be non-sustaining in 2024. Production is expected to be higher in the second half of the year, as Manh Choh comes online. Cash flow is also expected to be stronger in the second half, as a result of the protection profile, as well as our typical timing of payments, related to taxes in the first half of the year. Our 2025 production guidance of 2 million ounces remains unchanged from our guidance update last year. Looking ahead to 2026, as Paul noted, we've introduced another year of production guidance of 2 million ounces in line with 2025, and in line with our expectation, for production of approximately 2 million ounces, through the decade.\n\nBased on currently approved projects, attributable CapEx is expected to be $850 million in 2025 and $650 million in 2026. However, as we continue to approve additional projects to sustain our production level, we expect CapEx will ultimately remain stable around $1 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Claude to discuss our operations.\n\nClaude Schimper: Thank you, Andrea. Last quarter, I began by sharing the details of our Homegrown Safety Excellence Program, where we are taking a genuine bottom-up approach, to fostering our safety culture. The program has now been delivered to over 6,000 employees and business partners worldwide, with 44 different nationalities participating. We are proud of this program and will be relentless, in keeping safety as our core piece, of our operating philosophy. Moving on to our operations, as Paul highlighted, we delivered a strong end to the year, achieving our full year targets, on both production and costs. I'm pleased to say, this is a testament to the strong focus, and dedication to operational excellence that, our team demonstrated over the course of the year.\n\nOur two cornerstone operations, Tasiast and Paracatu, had another year of significant production. These two assets provided over half of our ounces and drove meaningful cash flow for our business. In 2023, we continued to advance our projects at Tasiast and La Coipa, which was successfully completed prior to the New Year. At Tasiast, we achieved record full year production 621,000 ounces, benefiting from strong throughputs and grades. In the fourth quarter, the mill demonstrated high throughput over the prior quarter, reaching a quarterly average rate of approximately 22,000 tons per day, driving a strong final quarter of production of 161,000 ounces. Cost of sales of $645 per ounce in the fourth quarter, was the lowest in the portfolio. Tasiast was our lowest cost producer in 2023, with a cost of sales of $661 per ounce. Aerial shot of a mine entrance, the bedrock of the company's gold and silver extraction.\n\nWe are anticipating another strong year from Tasiast, with production guided to be around 610,000 ounces, as higher throughput is offset by a lower planned grade. Margins are anticipated to be robust again this year, with cost of sales expected to be $670 per ounce. At the Tasiast solar power plant, construction is now complete, with the first power being delivered in December. We will be ramping up the plant throughput in the first half of the year. Paracatu had another year of substantial output, with full year production of 588,000 ounces. Production in Q4 was lower than Q3, as previously indicated, due to mine sequencing resulting in lower grades. The mill performance in Paracatu continues to be a standout, with excellent throughput and recovery performance in Q4.\n\nProduction in 2024, is expected to be lower and cost higher, as the mine sequencing continues to transition, through lower grade portions of the pit, before moving back into higher grades next year. At La Coipa, strong operating performance continued in Q4, with record quarterly production of 74,000 ounces, which was driven by higher throughput and strong grades. The full year production of 260,000 ounces exceeded the top end of guidance, while costs of $681 per ounce came in below the low end of guidance, driving strong free cash flow. La Coipa is expected to have another strong year, with a target of 250,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $800 per ounce. Moving to the U.S. assets, we had a strong final quarter, with production of 184,000 ounces and a cost of sales of $1,304 per ounce, both improving over the prior quarter.\n\nFull year production of 684,000 ounces, and a cost of sales of $1,318 per ounce was achieved. Production across the US assets is expected to increase this year to 730,000 ounces and a cost of sales, of $1,330 per ounce. The increased production, is due to the expected contribution from Manh Choh in the second half of the year, and higher production from Bald Mountain on higher planned ore stacking rates and higher grades. At Fort Knox, Q4 production of 84,000 ounces increased over the prior quarter, mainly due to higher mill throughput. At Manh Choh, construction is essentially complete, and the mining activities, including ore mining and stockpiling, have commenced. Construction of the mill modifications at Fort Knox also continues to progress.\n\nConstruction of the conveyors and associated buildings, along with the interior piping and mechanical installations, will continue throughout the first quarter. Pre-commissioning and operational readiness team is preparing for pre-commissioning activities. At Bald Mountain, Q4 production of approximately 44,000 ounces, improved over the prior quarter on higher grades, helping drive lower cost of sales. In 2024, Bald Mountain is expected to have a stronger year, with grades increasing in the back half of the year on mine planning. At Round Mountain, production of approximately 56,000 ounces, was lower over the prior quarter, due to fewer ounces recovered from the leach pads, while costs decreased due to the lower input costs, and timing of inventory movement.\n\nAs Paul mentioned, our work at Round Mountain is advancing on plan. Stripping of Phase S has commenced, and the operations team is in place. Detailed engineering of the pad expansion has been completed, and construction activities are on track. Production from Phase S remains on schedule, to begin in the second half of 2025. Round Mountain is expected, to produce at a level similar to 2023, with production coming from ongoing mining at Phase W2. With our projects complete and the operational momentum we are seeing across all our mines, we are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2024. With that, I will now pass the floor over to Will.\n\nWill Dunford: Thanks, Claude. I'll start by expanding on Round Mountain, provide updates on Curlew, Great Bear, and our exploration initiatives, before ending with a few comments on our year-end resource update. At Round Mountain, in addition to our ongoing work on the open pit phases, that Claude discussed, we continue to focus on exploring and studying our higher-grade, potentially higher-margin underground opportunities at Phase X and Gold Hill. We are progressing well with the exploration decline at Phase X, having developed 1,475 meters to-date, which is over half of the planned development for the initial exploration decline. This has put us in closer proximity to the target mineralization for Phase X, allowing us to commence exploration drilling along the periphery of the target earlier this year.\n\nThis drilling has already hit a high-grade, narrow vein with coarse, visible Gold, something we have seen throughout our history at Round Mountain, which has ultimately led to positive reconciliation, and we are pleased to see this trend continuing at depth. We will continue development of the exploration decline in parallel, with the exploration and definition drilling, and will be in a position to start definition drilling of the primary Phase X targets by Q2. At Gold Hill, infill drilling from the bottom of the open pit and exploration drilling from surface continue to advance as planned. Stepping back, we remain excited about the underground opportunities at Round Mountain. We see the potential for Phase X to come online in late 2026, or early 2027, and Gold Hill to come online towards the end of the decade, extending production at Round Mountain into the next decade.\n\nMoving to Curlew Basin, our results continue to trend well and support further work on the asset. Through 2023 exploration, we increased the size of the inferred resource by 34%, as we confirmed extensions and continuity within several key zones of mineralization. We have now delineated approximately 400,000 ounces, of measured and indicated, and 700,000 ounces of inferred resources, with strong grades of around 6 grams per ton. You will recall last quarter, we released results of hole 1,168 with 14 meters at 16.5 grams per ton, down dip at the Roadrunner zone, which was both wider and higher grade than our existing resource. As you can see on the slide, at the end of the year, we received assay results from a few more standout intercepts, showing higher grade, and wider potential in the Stealth zone, including ST-1312, which showed 27 meters at over 12 grams per ton.\n\nThese higher grade results are not included in this current resource update. Our focus this year will be to follow-up on this higher grade, wider mineralization encountered, both at Roadrunner and Stealth, and to continue advancing exploration efforts to expand the higher margin, wider, more continuous zones within our existing resource. We continue to study Curlew, to optimize the potential value, and determine the best path forward for this asset. Moving on to Great Bear. As Paul indicated, our 2023 drilling program exceeded our expectations, delivering a significant resource addition of more than 1 million ounces. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven, by higher grade underground additions, to the inferred resource at depth, enabled by the success of directional drilling.\n\nThis resulted in a 45% increase to the inferred resource, and a 28% increase in the inferred grade. The significant inferred grade increase was driven by the new underground resource, having come in at a higher average grade of 6 grams per ton, driving the overall inferred resource to 4.5 grams per ton. The total project resource now stands at approximately 2.8 million ounces of measured and indicated, and 3.3 million ounces of inferred resources. As a reminder, the scope of 2023's drilling program was primarily, to add underground resources at depth in the main LP zone. To execute on this plan, we introduced directional drilling, which was very effective, allowing us to meaningfully increase the underground resource at LP. As you can see on the slide, our primary resource additions came from new, higher grade underground resources, between the 500 and 1,000 meters levels, showing a significant extension to the LP zone.\n\nThese extensions clearly continue, to demonstrate our thesis of this orogenic deposit, continuing with strong grades at depth. You can also see on the slide that we continue to intercept high-grade mineralization, beyond our current resource additions at depth. Of particular note is hole BR-843, shown with a star just to the left of center, which intersected 389 grams per tonight, over a minable width of 3.5 meters. Given the timing of this drilling, this intercept didn't make it into this resource update, but this hole, along with all the other assays we see, continues to support our view that this will be a high-quality, long-life underground mine following the initial open pit. While the LP zone, represents the bulk of our resource expansion, we also saw some growth at Hinge and Limb, more classic Red Lake-style deposits.\n\nAnd as noted last quarter, we saw multiple high-grade intercepts at Hinge, from the directional drilling well below the current resource, again showing potential for future extensions at depth. Hinge and Limb continue to show potential to supplement production from the LP zone in the future and demonstrate the significant optionality of our land package. Looking to this year's exploration program, our strategy will be similar to last year's, with our primary focus on further expanding, the mineralized zones at LP, including both the central LP area, and extensions at Discovery and Viggo. We will also continue to look for additional deposits along strike and for expansions of our Red Lake-style mineralization at Hinge and Limb. The 2024 program, will be comprised of approximately 120 kilometers of drilling.\n\nOur program, will continue the targeted expansions of the underground resource. However, it's worth noting, because planned drilling will be deeper, progress on resource additions is expected to be more modest, than realized in 2023. Moving to other areas at Great Bear. As a reminder, we are advancing across two key streams. The AEX underground decline, through which we plan to obtain a bulk sample, and perform definition and infill drilling in the LP zone, and the main project, which includes the mine, mill and related infrastructure required for production. For the AEX decline, the mining lease for the main AEX surface footprint has been received, providing us with the necessary surface and mining rights to develop AEX, subject to obtaining the required provincial permits.\n\nFeasibility level design and engineering, is now complete. The surface design for AEX is shown here on the slide, and detailed engineering for the AEX infrastructure is well underway. Provincial permitting of the AEX remains on track. Procurement for long-lead items such as the camp, power infrastructure, and water treatment is underway, and we are targeting a potential start of the surface construction, for AEX in the second half of the year, subject to receipt of permits, and potential start of the underground decline in mid-2025. For the main project, we will continue to advance technical studies, including engineering and field test work campaigns. The results of this work will be outlined in our PEA, planned for the second half of the year.\n\nThe initial project description has been submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, formally commencing the federal assessment process. The detailed project description is expected to be formally submitted shortly. The comprehensive baseline study program, encompassing air, noise, hydrogeology, geochemistry, archaeology, water quality, and several other categories, continues to advance. These studies underpin our Indigenous consultation and permitting efforts. Our exploration team was very active in 2023. In addition to the drilling success at Great Bear, we also saw strong developments from within our portfolio of brownfield and greenfield prospects. Our brownfields program, which accounts for approximately 90% of our exploration budget, consisted of more than 200 kilometers of drilling last year, taking place primarily within the footprint of existing mines and projects, where we are targeting higher-grade, potentially higher-margin deposits, and possible extensions within our current 31.38 merits.\n\nAs detailed in a press release, this program demonstrated notable results across several locations. Having already discussed Round Mountain, I'll start with our other U.S. assets. At Fort Knox, the program focused primarily on two main areas, proximal growth around the Fort Knox pit, and on deeper underground targets within the Dandelion and Shear Zone. At Manh Choh, near-mine exploration work took place at six targets, and the exploration program, was expanded to include several new targets identified, near the mine road corridor. At Bald Mountain, drilling focused on near-term resource growth, which resulted in an addition to the reserve. Moving to Tasiast, RC drilling testing for extensions of the north satellite area successfully intersected mineralization, and proved the continuity of a known structure along the primary greenstone belt.\n\nDrilling this year will look to further explore on-trend of this mineralization. In addition, deep drilling planned for this year, will begin targeting extensions at West Branch, Piment and Prolongation, with the aim of supporting an underground mining scenario at Tasiast. Moving to Chile, our brownfields drilling program uncovered potential pore-free mineralization approximately 8 kilometers due north of our mine facilities. At La Coipa, we completed approximately 15 kilometers of drilling to test the extent of near-surface oxide mineralization, proximal to current and historic pits. In Brazil, recent drilling of soil anomalies, primarily to the Northwest of Paracatu have revealed similar-style mineralization in grades in the same post packages.\n\nFurther drilling at several untested soil targets will take place this year. Moving to our greenfields program, approximately 52 kilometers of drilling, was completed across Manitoba, Nevada, and our JV project in Northern Finland. Our large Snow Lake land package in Manitoba, continued to show exciting potential, for high-grade gold mineralization, associated with shear-hosted quartz veinings. In Nevada, RC drilling was completed across several prospective properties with the potential for low- sulphidation epithermal, Carlin-style gold mineralization. In Finland, we continue to advance exploration on the Launi East property alongside our joint venture partner. Moving to our broader reserve and resource update, as Paul mentioned, our reserves declined this year, as we are in a phase of resource growth focused on adding higher-grade ounces at earlier-stage projects, such as Great Bear, Curlew, and the Round Mountain Undergrounds.\n\nOur measured and indicated resources, remained stable at approximately 26 million ounces, and inferred resources were up more than 1 million ounces, driven by the previously discussed high-grade additions at Great Bear and Curlew. We are excited by the significantly higher grade of these inferred resources, increasing the quality of our overall resource base, and providing potential for future high-margin production. I will now turn it back to Paul.\n\nPaul Rollinson: Thanks, Will. After delivering on our commitments in 2023, we intend to carry this momentum into 2024. Our business is well-positioned to deliver another strong year, both operationally and financially. And looking forward, we remain excited about our future. We have a strong production profile. We are generating significant cash flow. We have an investment-grade balance sheet. We have a competitive dividend. We have an exciting pipeline of exploration and development opportunities, across several attractive jurisdictions. And we are very proud of our commitment to responsible mining that continues, to make us a leader in ESG performance within the industry. With that, operator, I'd like to open up the line to questions.\n\nSee also 15 States with the Best Healthcare in the US and 12 Best European Dating Sites Without Payment.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "title": "Kinross Gold (KGC) Q4 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates",
        "content": "Kinross Gold (KGC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.09 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 22.22%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this gold mining company would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of 20%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nKinross Gold , which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, posted revenues of $1.12 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.08 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nKinross Gold shares have lost about 18% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for Kinross Gold?\n\nWhile Kinross Gold has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kinross Gold: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.08 on $867.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.41 on $4.06 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Mining - Gold is currently in the bottom 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 15.\n\nThis gold mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines' revenues are expected to be $1.52 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It remains well-positioned to deliver another strong year in 2024. La Coipa achieved record quarterly production driven by strong throughput and grades. Paracatu delivered another year of steady production including record recovery in 2023. Tasiast, Paracatu and La Coipa represented nearly 70% of production and were the lowest cost mines in the portfolio, contributing significant free cash flow. Great Bear increased its year-over-year inferred resource estimate by 45%, adding more than one million ounces primarily driven by high-grade underground additions. Kinross has increased Great Bear\u2019s mineral resource estimate to approximately 2.8 million Au oz. of measured and indicated mineral resources, and to approximately 3.3 million ounces of inferred mineral resources. At Manh Choh, mining activities are well underway including the commencement of ore mining and stockpiling. The project remains on budget and on schedule for initial production in the second half of 2024. At Round Mountain, mining of Phase S has commenced. Development of the Phase X exploration decline is approaching the target mineralization, with drilling activities having commenced in early 2024 and set to ramp up through the year.\n\nStory continues\n\n2023 Q4 and full-year highlights:\n\nProduction of 546,513 Au eq. oz. in Q4 2023, and 2,153,020 Au eq. oz. in 2023.

Kinross\u2019 Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per common share payable on March 21, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2024.\n\nCEO Commentary:\r\nJ. Paul Rollinson, President and CEO, made the following comments in relation to 2023 fourth-quarter and year-end results:\n\n\u201c2023 was a great year at Kinross and I am proud of our global team who achieved the results that underpin our reputation as strong operators. We met our production, cost and capital guidance, and completed our projects at Tasiast and La Coipa. Our portfolio of mines produced solid results, we more than doubled free cash flow year-over-year while maintaining our investment grade balance sheet, and we are carrying this momentum into 2024.\n\n\u201cWe expect to deliver another strong year in 2024, producing approximately 2.1 million gold equivalent ounces. Our development projects are progressing well and we look forward to first production from Manh Choh in the second half of the year. Great Bear continues to exceed expectations and we were excited to add more than one million ounces of higher-grade underground resource. We continue to successfully target extensions of the resource at depth, reinforcing our view that Great Bear has the potential to be a large, long-life, high-grade mining complex.\n\n\u201cOperating responsibly, delivering on our commitments and advancing our ESG strategy continue to be key principles of our day-to-day operations. Kinross was recently named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, reflecting our commitment to corporate citizenship as a core value and key strategic driver of our business. We expect to publish our 2023 Sustainability and ESG Report in May and some highlights from the year include:\n\nCompleted construction of the solar power plant at Tasiast and are on track to achieve our goal of reducing emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 from our 2021 baseline; In Brazil, we published a book on the Cerrado biodiversity corridor, highlighting the importance of protecting this critical region and the strategic approach taken by our Paracatu site; Made approximately $10 million of monetary and in-kind contributions through site social investments; and Established the \u201cKinross Alaska Future Leaders\u201d scholarship at the University of Alaska Fairbanks focused on advancing the inclusion of underrepresented people in the resource industry.\u201d\n\nFinancial results\n\nSummary of financial and operating results\n\nThree months ended Years ended December 31, December 31, (unaudited, in millions of U.S. dollars, except ounces, per share amounts, and per ounce amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022  Operating Highlights  Total gold equivalent ounces from continuing operations(a),(b) Produced 546,513  595,683 2,153,020  1,957,237 Sold 565,389  620,599 2,179,936  1,927,818 Financial Highlights from Continuing Operations(a) Metal sales $ 1,115.7  $ 1,076.2 $ 4,239.7  $ 3,455.1 Production cost of sales $ 552.0  $ 526.5 $ 2,054.4  $ 1,805.7 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 271.7  $ 251.9 $ 986.8  $ 784.0 Impairment charges and asset derecognition $ 38.9  $ 350.0 $ 38.9  $ 350.0 Operating earnings $ 193.5  $ (160.1 ) $ 801.4  $ 117.7 Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ 65.4  $ (106.0 ) $ 416.3  $ 31.9 Basic earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ 0.06  $ (0.08 ) $ 0.34  $ 0.02 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ 0.06  $ (0.08 ) $ 0.34  $ 0.02 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders(c) $ 140.0  $ 108.2 $ 539.8  $ 283.1 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per share(c) $ 0.11  $ 0.09 $ 0.44  $ 0.22 Net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities $ 410.9  $ 474.3 $ 1,605.3  $ 1,002.5 Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations(c) $ 407.4  $ 496.1 $ 1,669.9  $ 1,256.5 Capital expenditures from continuing operations(d)  $ 311.3  $ 316.8 $ 1,098.3  $ 764.2 Attributable(g) capital expenditures from continuing operations(c) $ 297.7  $ 312.7 $ 1,055.0  $ 755.0 Attributable(g) free cash flow from continuing operations(c) $ 116.7  $ 162.6 $ 559.7  $ 247.3 Average realized gold price per ounce from continuing operations(e) $ 1,974  $ 1,731 $ 1,945  $ 1,793 Production cost of sales from continuing operations per equivalent ounce(b) sold(f) $ 976  $ 848 $ 942  $ 937 Production cost of sales from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis(c) $ 936  $ 793 $ 892  $ 912 All-in sustaining cost from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis(c) $ 1,328  $ 1,203 $ 1,284  $ 1,255 All-in sustaining cost from continuing operations per equivalent ounce(b) sold(c) $ 1,353  $ 1,236 $ 1,316  $ 1,271 Attributable(g) all-in cost from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis(c) $ 1,699  $ 1,525 $ 1,619  $ 1,538 Attributable(g) all-in cost from continuing operations per equivalent ounce(b) sold(c) $ 1,709  $ 1,540 $ 1,634  $ 1,545\n\n(a) Results for the three months and year-ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are from continuing operations and exclude results from the Company\u2019s Chirano and Russian operations due to the classification of these operations as discontinued and their sale in 2022.

The 10% year-over-year increase was largely a result of higher production at La Coipa due to the ramp-up of operations in the second half of 2022, and higher mill grades, recoveries and throughput at Tasiast, partially offset by lower production at Bald Mountain, consistent with the mine plan.\n\nAverage realized gold price: The average realized gold price from continuing operations in Q4 2023 was $1,974 per ounce, compared with $1,731 per ounce in Q4 2022. For full-year 2023, the average realized gold price per ounce from continuing operations was $1,945, compared with $1,793 per ounce for full-year 2022.\n\nRevenue: During the fourth quarter, revenue from continuing operations increased to $1,115.7 million, compared with $1,076.2 million during Q4 2022. Revenue from continuing operations increased to $4,239.7 million for full-year 2023, compared with $3,455.1 million for full-year 2022. The 23% year-over-year increase is due to the increase in production at Tasiast and La Coipa and higher average realized gold price.\n\nProduction cost of sales: Production cost of sales from continuing operations per Au eq. oz.2 sold was $976 for Q4 2023, compared with $848 in Q4 2022. Production cost of sales from continuing operations per Au eq. oz.2 sold was $942 for full-year 2023, largely in line with $937 per Au eq. oz. for full-year 2022.\n\nProduction cost of sales from continuing operations per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis3 was $936 in Q4 2023 compared with $793 in Q4 2022, based on gold sales of 543,173 ounces and silver sales of 1,890,563 ounces.

Operating cash flow from continuing operations for full-year 2023 was $1,605.3 million, compared with $1,002.5 million for full-year 2022, primarily due to the increase in margins.\n\nAdjusted operating cash flow3 from continuing operations for Q4 2023 was $407.4 million, compared with $496.1 million for Q4 2022. Adjusted operating cash flow3 from continuing operations for full-year 2023 was $1,669.9 million, compared with $1,256.5 million in 2022.\n\nAttributable1 free cash flow3: Attributable free cash flow from continuing operations was $116.7 million in Q4 2023, compared with $162.6 million in Q4 2022. Attributable free cash flow for full-year 2023 from continuing operations was $559.7 million compared with attributable free cash flow of $247.3 million in 2022.\n\nEarnings7: Reported net earnings from continuing operations were $65.4 million for Q4 2023, or $0.06 per share, compared with reported net loss of $106.0 million, or $0.08 per share, for Q4 2022. Full-year reported net earnings in 2023 were $416.3 million, or $0.34 per share, compared with reported net earnings of $31.9 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2022.\n\nAdjusted net earnings3,8 from continuing operations were $140.0 million, or $0.11 per share, for Q4 2023, compared with $108.2 million, or $0.09 per share, for Q4 2022. Full-year adjusted net earnings3,8 from continuing operations were $539.8 million, or $0.44 per share, compared with $283.1 million, or $0.22 per share, for full-year 2022.\n\nAttributable1 capital expenditures4: Full-year attributable capital expenditures from continuing operations were $1,055.0 million compared with $755.0 million for 2022. The full-year increase was primarily due to an increase in capital stripping at Tasiast and Fort Knox, and increased development activities at the Manh Choh project. Capital expenditures from continuing operations4 were $311.3 million for Q4 2023, compared with $316.8 million for Q4 2022. Capital expenditures from continuing operations4 for full-year 2023 were $1,098.3 million, compared with $764.2 million in 2022.\n\nBalance sheet\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company repaid the $140.0 million balance on its Tasiast loan, ahead of its 2027 maturity date, and the remaining $50 million balance on the revolving credit facility.\n\nAfter the repayments, Kinross had cash and cash equivalents of $352.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with $418.1 million at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company had additional available credit10 of $1,557.5 million as of December 31, 2023, and total liquidity9 of approximately $1.9 billion.\n\nReturn of capital\n\nAs part of its continuing quarterly dividend program, the Company declared a dividend of $0.03 per common share payable on March 21, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2024. In 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares.\n\nOperating results\n\nMine-by-mine summaries for 2023 fourth-quarter and full-year operating results may be found on pages 21 and 25 of this news release. Highlights include the following:\n\nTasiast performed strongly in 2023, with production increasing 15% compared with full-year 2022. The record annual production was mainly a result of strong grades, record throughput following the completion of the Tasiast 24k project, and higher recoveries. Quarter-over-quarter, production was lower as a result of lower grades and timing of ounces processed at the mill, partially offset by higher throughput and recovery.\n\nTasiast\u2019s full-year cost of sales per ounce was lower year-over-year mainly due to the increase in production as well as the higher proportion of capital development related to capital stripping of West Branch 5. Cost of sales per ounce sold was largely in line quarter-over-quarter. Following the completion of the solar power plant, the Company expects to realize immediate and long-term operating cost savings.\n\nParacatu full-year production increased compared with 2022 primarily due to an increase in mill throughput, as well as record-high recoveries, partially offset by lower grades. Production decreased quarter-over-quarter mainly due to lower grades, as expected, partially offset by higher mill throughput. Cost of sales per ounce sold was higher in both comparable periods mainly due to lower ounces sold and increased mining volumes, as expected, and unfavourable foreign exchange changes.\n\nLa Coipa continued to perform well and achieved record quarterly production since its restart in February 2022 driven by strong grades and throughput. Cost of sales per ounce was higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter mainly due to a reduction in capitalized stripping.\n\nFort Knox full-year production and cost of sales were largely in line with 2022. Quarter-over-quarter production increased mainly due to higher mill throughput as well as timing of ounces processed in the mill. Compared with Q3 2023, cost of sales per ounce sold was higher mainly due to less capital development, partially offset by higher production.\n\nRound Mountain full-year production increased year-over-year primarily due to an increase in ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. Quarter-over-quarter production decreased primarily due to fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads, partially offset by higher grades. Full-year cost of sales per ounce increased year-over-year mainly as a result of higher-cost ounces recovered from the heap leach pads and less capital development. Cost of sales per ounce sold in Q4 2023 decreased compared with the previous quarter largely due to lower costs related to labour and consumables, partly offset by timing of inventory movements.\n\nBald Mountain full-year production decreased largely due to lower grades and timing of ounces recovered from the heap leach pads. Compared with the previous quarter, production increased mainly due to higher grades. Full-year cost of sales per ounce sold increased as a result of higher-cost heap leach ounces, as well as higher contractor, reagent and maintenance costs. Compared with Q3 2023, fourth quarter cost of sales per ounce sold was lower mainly due to higher production, a higher proportion of capital development, and lower contractor and reagent costs, partially offset by timing of ounces recovered.\n\nDevelopment projects\n\nGreat Bear\n\nAt the Great Bear project, the Company\u2019s robust exploration program continues to make excellent progress, execution planning for the advanced exploration program is well underway, and permitting continues to advance on plan.\n\nFollowing the completion of its 2023 drilling program, Kinross has increased Great Bear\u2019s mineral resource estimate to approximately 2.8 Moz. of measured and indicated resources and approximately 3.3 Moz. of inferred resources. This includes the addition of more than one million higher-grade, underground inferred ounces, representing a 45% year-over-year increase.\n\nKinross continues to add higher-grade material to the underground resource base, as demonstrated by the year-over-year increase in the inferred grade, which went from 3.6 g/t to 4.5 g/t. While the primary additions were in the LP zone, resources at Hinge and Limb, traditional Red Lake style deposits proximal to the LP zone, also increased. Further, high-grade intercepts below the resource at Hinge in 2023 demonstrated the potential for this mineralization to also continue at depth potentially supplementing LP zone production in the future.\n\nThe updated mineral resource estimate is set out in the table below:\n\nGreat Bear Mineral Resource estimates 2022\r\n(Au koz) Year-over-year additions\r\n (Au koz) 2023 \r\n(Au koz) Grade\r\n(Au g/t) Measured and Indicated Resources 2,737 75 2,813 2.7 Inferred Resources 2,290 1,025 3,315 4.5\n\nSince the last update on November 8, 2023, the Company has received additional assay results, with a selection of the new results highlighted below.\u00a0Recent results highlighted in this release were received after the 2023 resource database cut-off and have not been used to inform year end resource figures.\n\nNotable exploration results\u00a0at Great Bear in the fourth quarter include:\n\nBR-807 (Discovery) 2.7m @ 9.7 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 880m BR-814C6 (Yauro) 6.6m @ 8.4 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 750m\n\nIncluding 2.3m @ 23.3 g/t Au BR-819 (Auro) 8.9m @ 13.9 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 700m\n\nIncluding 2.3m @ 51.5 g/t Au BR-843AC1A (Yuma) 15.4m @ 89.1 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 900m\n\nIncluding 3.5m @ 389.6 g/t Au BR-890 (Discovery) 1.6m @ 18.8 g/t Au at a vertical depth of 1070m\n\nThese results continue to support the view of a high-grade, large, long-life mining complex at Great Bear. Hole BR-843AC1A has intersected 3.5m @ 389.6 g/t at 900m vertical depth at Yuma and is expected to further increase the grade of already high-grade resource stopes in that area. Holes BR-814C6 and BR-819 demonstrate the continuity of wide, high-grade mineralization below the current resource at Yauro and Auro respectively. To the northwest, holes BR-807 and BR-890A have intersected high-grade mineralization at depths of 880m and 1070m respectively, vertically below surface which highlights the highly prospective undertested area beneath Discovery.\n\nKinross is progressing provincial permitting, engineering, and execution planning activities for an advanced exploration (AEX) program that would establish an underground decline to obtain a bulk sample and allow for definition and infill drilling in the LP zone. The mining lease for the main AEX surface footprint has now been received, providing Kinross with the necessary surface and mining rights to develop the AEX project, subject to obtaining the required provincial permits.\n\nDetailed engineering for AEX infrastructure is well underway, and orders have been placed for the onsite camp and high-quality water treatment facility. Procurement activities for additional infrastructure and site construction activities are progressing well.\n\nKinross is targeting a start of the surface construction for the AEX program in the second half of 2024, subject to receipt of permits, with start of the underground decline planned in mid-2025.\n\nFor the main project, Kinross continues to advance technical studies, including engineering and field test work campaigns, with plans to release the results of this work in the form of a preliminary economic assessment in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe required Federal Impact Assessment for the main project is underway. The Initial Project Description has been submitted to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, formally kicking off the federal assessment process. The Detailed Project Description is expected to be formally submitted in Q1 2024. Studies are ongoing and the Company expects to file its Impact Statement in the first half of 2025.\n\nSelected Great Bear Drill Results\r\nSee Appendix A for full results.\n\nHole ID From \r\n(m) To \r\n(m) Width \r\n(m) True \r\nWidth (m) Au \r\n(g/t) Target BR-807 964.5 980.6 16.1 14.1 0.59 Discovery BR-807 and 994.5 1,009.5 15.0 13.2 1.65 BR-807 including 1,002.3 1,008.0 5.8 5.1 3.33 BR-807 and 1,027.2 1,037.7 10.5 9.2 0.44 BR-807 and 1,059.0 1,069.5 10.5 9.2 0.89 BR-807 and 1,084.8 1,089.0 4.2 3.7 1.74 BR-807 and 1,095.7 1,209.0 113.3 99.7 0.67 BR-807 including 1,106.7 1,109.7 3.0 2.7 9.68 BR-807 and including 1,207.9 1,209.0 1.2 1.0 21.70 BR-814C6 717.7 729.4 11.7 9.4 0.71 Yauro BR-814C6 and 893.3 897.2 3.9 3.1 0.61 BR-814C6 and 910.8 919.0 8.3 6.6 8.40 BR-814C6 including 913.2 916.0 2.9 2.3 23.32 BR-814C6 and 928.0 931.3 3.3 2.6 0.72 BR-814C6 and 1,036.5 1,040.5 4.0 3.2 6.91 BR-814C6 including 1,037.5 1,040.5 3.0 2.4 8.78 BR-814C6 and 1,068.0 1,074.6 6.6 5.2 0.72 BR-819 849.2 855.7 6.5 5.7 0.38 Auro BR-819 and 876.0 886.2 10.2 8.9 13.87 BR-819 including 879.0 881.7 2.7 2.3 51.45 BR-843AC1A 1,317.1 1,336.4 19.3 15.4 89.14 Yuma BR-843AC1A including 1,317.1 1,321.5 4.4 3.5 389.57 BR-843AC1A and 1,481.8 1,484.8 3.0 2.4 2.07 BR-890A 1,331.5 1,363.2 31.7 26.3 2.01 Discovery BR-890A including 1,361.2 1,363.2 2.0 1.6 18.79 BR-890A and 1,369.5 1,375.7 6.2 5.1 0.77\n\nResults are preliminary in nature and are subject to on-going QA/QC. Lengths are subject to rounding.\n\nSee Appendix B for a LP zone long section.\n\nManh Choh\n\nAt the 70% owned Manh Choh project, of which Kinross is the operator, construction is essentially complete, on budget and on schedule for production in the second half of 2024. Mining activities are well underway including the commencement of ore mining and stockpiling. Transportation of ore to Fort Knox, where it will be processed, has commenced and will gradually increase throughout the first half of the year.\n\nModifications to the Fort Knox mill continue to progress on schedule and on budget.\u00a0Construction of the conveyors and associated buildings are planned for the first quarter along with interior piping and mechanical installations. The commissioning and operational readiness team is in place and preparing for pre-commissioning activities following the mechanical completion of each area.\n\nTasiast solar power plant\n\nAt the Tasiast solar power plant, construction of the solar field and battery system is now complete, with first solar power delivered to the Tasiast grid in December 2023. Commissioning of the battery system and energy management system will continue in early 2024, supporting the solar field and battery system integration and power ramp-up. During the first quarter of 2024, grid scenario testing involving incumbent generators, the solar field, and battery systems will continue toward ensuring stable power from this new renewable energy source. The\u00a0Tasiast solar power plant has a continuous power generation capacity of 34MW and an 18MW battery storage system.\n\nRound Mountain\n\nThe extension strategy at Round Mountain is advancing on plan. At Phase S, the operations team is in place and stripping remains on schedule. For the heap leach pad expansion, detailed engineering is complete, procurement is in progress, and construction activities remain on track.\n\nAt Phase X, development of the exploration decline is progressing well and more than 50% complete, with approximately 1,475 metres developed so far, and is approaching the target mineralization. Underground definition drilling commenced in early 2024 and is set to ramp up throughout the year. The Company expects to begin drilling the primary Phase X target\u00a0in Q2. At Gold Hill, drilling continues to progress as planned with an infill program from the bottom of the pit and exploration drilling from surface.\n\nChile\n\nKinross\u2019 activities in Chile are currently focused on La Coipa and potential opportunities to extend its mine life. The\u00a0Lobo-Marte\u00a0project continues to provide optionality as a potential large, low-cost mine upon the conclusion of mining at La Coipa. While the Company focuses its technical resources on La Coipa, it will continue to engage and build relationships with communities related to Lobo-Marte and government stakeholders.\n\nCompany Guidance \r\nThe following section of the news release represents forward-looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary. We refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information on page 48 of this news release.\n\nThis Company Guidance section below references all-in sustaining cost per equivalent ounce sold and sustaining, non-sustaining and attributable capital expenditures, which are non-GAAP ratios and financial measures, as applicable, with no standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The definitions of these non-GAAP ratios and financial measures and comparable reconciliations are included on pages 26 to 30 of this news release.\n\nAttributable1 production guidance\n\nIn 2024, Kinross expects to produce 2.1 million attributable Au eq. oz.11 (+/- 5%) from its operations, in line with total 2023 production of 2,153,020 Au eq. oz. Kinross\u2019 annual production is expected to remain stable in 2025 and 2026 at 2.0 million attributable Au eq. oz.11 (+/- 5%) per year.\n\nAnnual attributable1 gold equivalent production guidance\r\n(+/- 5%) 2024 2.1 million oz. 2025 2.0 million oz. 2026 2.0 million oz.\n\nIn 2024, attributable production is expected to be higher in the second half of the year, which is largely driven by expected initial production at Manh Choh, as well as higher production at Paracatu.\n\nAttributable1 cost guidance\n\nProduction cost of sales is expected to be $1,020 per Au eq. oz.11 (+/- 5%) for 2024. In 2023, production cost of sales was $942 per Au eq. oz. The moderate year-over-year increase in 2024 is mainly due to production mix, including higher expected production from the Company\u2019s U.S. assets and lower production at Paracatu, and inflationary impacts.\n\nThe Company expects its all-in sustaining cost3 to be $1,360 per Au eq. oz. (+/- 5%) for 2024. In 2023, all-in sustaining cost3 was $1,316 per Au eq. oz. sold.\n\n2024 attributable1 production and cost guidance\n\nAttributable basis1 Q4 2023 \r\nresults 2023 full-year \r\nresults 2024 guidance\r\n(+/- 5%) Gold equivalent basis Production (Au eq. oz.) 546,513 2.15 million 2.1 million11 Production cost of sales per Au eq. oz.2 sold $976 $942 $1,020 All-in sustaining cost per Au eq. oz. sold3 $1,353 $1,316 $1,360\n\n2024 attributable1 production and cost guidance by country\n\nCountry 2024 production \r\nguidance \r\n(Au eq. oz.)11\r\n(+/-5%) Percentage \r\nof total \r\nforecast \r\nproduction12 2024 guidance \r\nproduction cost of sales \r\n(per Au eq. oz. sold)2,11\r\n(+/-5%) 2023 production \r\ncost of sales\r\n(per Au eq. oz. sold)2 United States 730,000 35% $1,330 $1,318 Brazil 510,000 24% $1,080 $909 Chile 250,000 12% $800 $681 Mauritania 610,000 29% $670 $661 TOTAL  2.1 million  100% $1,020 $942\n\nMaterial assumptions used to forecast 2024 production cost of sales are as follows:\n\na gold price of $2,000 per ounce; a silver price of $25 per ounce; an oil price of $75 per barrel; foreign exchange rates of:\n\n4.75 Brazilian reais to the U.S. dollar; 800 Chilean pesos to the U.S. dollar; 35 Mauritanian ouguiyas to the U.S. dollar; and 1.30 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar;\n\nTaking into account existing currency and oil hedges:\n\na 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates13 would be expected to result in an approximate $20 impact on production cost of sales per ounce; specific to the Brazilian real, a 10% change in this exchange rate would be expected to result in an approximate $40 impact on Brazilian production cost of sales per ounce; specific to the Chilean peso, a 10% change in this exchange rate would be expected to result in an approximate $30 impact on Chilean production cost of sales per ounce; a $10 per barrel change in the price of oil would be expected to result in an approximate $3 impact on fuel consumption costs on production cost of sales per ounce; and a $100 change in the price of gold would be expected to result in an approximate $4 impact on production cost of sales per ounce as a result of a change in royalties.\n\nAttributable1 capital expenditures4 guidance\n\nAttributable capital expenditures for 2024 are forecast to be approximately $1,050 million (+/- 5%) and are summarized in the table below. The 2024 capital expenditures guidance is in line with 2023 results.\n\nKinross\u2019 attributable capital expenditures outlook for 2025 and 2026 is $850 million and $650 million, respectively, based on currently approved projects. As Kinross continues to develop and optimize its portfolio for production beyond 2026, other projects may be incorporated into its capital expenditures, as well as potential inflationary impacts, over the 2024-2025 timeframe.\n\nCountry Forecast 2024\r\nsustaining \r\ncapital14\r\n(+/-5%)\r\n(attributable)1\r\n(million) Forecast 2024\r\nnon-sustaining\r\n capital14\r\n(+/-5%)\r\n(attributable)1\r\n(million) Total 2024 \r\nforecast \r\ncapital14\r\n(+/-5%)\r\n(attributable)1\r\n(million)  2023 \r\nsustaining\r\ncapital3\r\nmillion)  2023 \r\nnon-sustaining\r\n capital3\r\n(million)  2023 \r\ntotal capital\r\n(consolidated)\r\n(million)  2023 \r\ntotal capital\r\n(attributable)1\r\n(million)  U.S.  $250 $180 $430 $303 $216 $519 $476 Brazil $145 $0 $145 $167 $0 $167 $167 Chile $55 $15 $70 $36 $39 $75 $75 Mauritania $50 $270 $320 $46 $263 $309 $309 Canada15 and other $0 $85 $85 $2 $26 $28 $28 TOTAL  $500 $550 $1,050 $554 $544 $1,098 $1,055\n\n2024 sustaining capital14 includes the following forecast spending estimates:\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Mine development: $115 million (United States); $20 million (Chile); \u2022\u00a0 Mobile equipment: $65 million (United States); $60 million (Brazil); $5 million (Chile); $20 million (Mauritania) \u2022\u00a0 Mill facilities: $5 million (United States); $25 million (Brazil); $10 million (Chile); $5 million (Mauritania) \u2022\u00a0 Leach facilities: $25 million (United States) \u2022\u00a0 Tailings facilities: $5 million (United States); $50 million (Brazil), $5 million (Chile); $15 million (Mauritania)\n\n2024 non-sustaining capital14 includes the following forecast spending estimates:\n\n\u2022\u00a0 Tasiast West Branch stripping: $235 million \u2022\u00a0 Round Mountain Phase S stripping and others: $120 million \u2022\u00a0 Great Bear AEX and studies15: $85 million \u2022\u00a0 Manh Choh (70%)16: $60 million \u2022\u00a0 Development and growth projects and studies: $50 million\n\nOther 2024 guidance\n\nCategory 2024 Guidance Summary Exploration and Business Development ($M)  $185 (+/- 5%) 2024 guidance includes approximately $160 million of exploration spend on greenfields, brownfields and minex exploration targets (2023 - $158.9 million).\r\n\r\nFor details about the 2024 exploration program, see page 14.  General and Administrative ($M)  $115 (+/- 5%) Largely in line with 2023 results.  Other Operating Costs ($M)  ~$100 Primarily relates to studies and permitting activities, as well as care and maintenance and reclamation activities at non-operating sites.  Effective Tax Rate (ETR)17  33% - 38% ETR\u00a0based on adjusted net earnings3 from continuing operations.  Taxes paid (cash) ($M)  $155 Taxes paid is expected to increase by approximately $5 million for every $100/oz movement in the realized gold price.  DD&A ($/oz.)18  $540/oz. (+/- 5%) The forecasted increase in DD&A per ounce largely relates to an increase in depreciable asset base, relating to assets recently or to be put into service for 2024.  Interest paid ($M) \r\n(incl. capitalized interest)  $150 Includes approximately $105 million of capitalized interest and $45 million of interest expense.\r\n\r\nInterest expense excludes accretion of the Company\u2019s reclamation and remediation obligations, as well as lease liabilities, which for 2023 totaled $39.1 million.\n\nEnvironment, Social and Governance\n\nIn 2023,\u00a0Kinross continued its strong ESG performance through implementation of its ESG strategy, with priority focus areas in Workforce and Communities, Natural Capital and Climate and Energy. ESG is a key factor in the Company\u2019s culture, business strategy and future growth plans. Our focus on strong governance was maintained, including a bespoke ESG training session conducted for the Board of Directors. In addition, updated Social Performance standards were developed, while work began on updating the standards for health and safety, and environment.\n\nKinross maintained consistently high ESG ratings as measured by S&P CSA, MSCI, Refinitiv, Moody\u2019s ESG, and Sustainalytics. With a 97th percentile ranking as of December 31, 2023, in its S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), Kinross was named a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) World Index for 2023 and the S&P ESG 1200. In The Globe and Mail\u2019s annual Board Games governance rating, Kinross maintained its ranking in the top group of Canadian mining companies. Kinross obtained external assurance of conformance with the Responsible Gold Mining Principles, which were established by the World Gold Council, and was provided a limited assurance statement as of March 31, 2023. The Company has established an ongoing process to ensure that every Kinross site meets the conformance requirements every three years.\n\nAcross sites,\u00a0operational ESG performance focused on the Company\u2019s First Priorities including health and safety, environment, and communities.\u00a0In health and safety, the Company maintained low injury frequency rates that were in line with three-year averages and continued its focus on a people-centric and progressive safety philosophy. In environment, Kinross completed a detailed assessment of the Company\u2019s status against the requirements of the Task Force on Nature-related Disclosures and plans to use the results to inform development of a Natural Capital strategy during 2024. At Paracatu, Kinross published a book on the flora and fauna of the Cerrado biodiversity corridor, also highlighting the Company\u2019s long-term strategy to protect the biodiversity of this critical region in Brazil.\n\nKinross has also progressed on its Climate Strategy. Kinross is focused on renewable power purchase agreements, electric autonomous haulage partnerships, and energy-efficient opportunities across sites. The outcome of these initiatives is that Kinross is on track to achieve its greenhouse gas reduction goal of reducing emissions intensity by 30% in 2030 from its baseline. The Tasiast solar power plant, which has power generation capacity of 34MW and a battery system of 18MW, was completed and is expected to provide annualized fuel savings of 17 million litres of heavy oil, with a payback of less than five years. This translates into an 18% reduction of GHG emissions from the power plant over life of mine. Annualized GHG emissions reductions are estimated at 50 kilotonnes CO2e\u00a0and, as a result, 22.5% of Tasiast\u2019s energy generation will be from renewable sources.\n\nIn host communities,\u00a0a high level of interactions was maintained and approximately $10 million of monetary and in-kind contributions were made through site community investment strategies throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, Kinross Chile donated three fully equipped research facilities to the University of Atacama\u2019s high altitude research station in the Nevado Tres Cruces National Park near the La Coipa mine.\n\nKinross\u2019 support of education and training continued across all our sites. In Alaska, the Company donated $350,000 to the University of Alaska Fairbanks to establish the \u2018Kinross Alaska Future Leaders Scholarship,\u2019 which will focus on advancing the inclusion of underrepresented people in the resource development industry. In Canada, the endowed Kinross Chair in Environmental Governance at the University of Guelph continued to advance knowledge, with the most recent Chair exploring links between the environment and reconciliation. In Chile, research agreements are now in place with the University of Atacama in areas covering health and safety as well as paleontology.\n\nKinross continued its close engagement with Indigenous peoples related to its mines and operations. At the Great Bear project in northwestern Ontario, an updated exploration agreement was signed together with the Wabauskang and Lac Seul First Nations. At the Manh Choh project in Alaska, a groundbreaking ceremony was held with the presence of the Chief, elders, and delegates from the Native Village of Tetlin, as well as Alaska\u2019s Governor and other government officials.\n\nThrough an in-depth consultation process across all Kinross sites and coordinated through the Kinross Global Inclusion and Diversity Council, an updated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategy was developed. Roll-out of this strategy will commence in 2024. In 2023, Kinross achieved the highest percentage of female employees to date and also increased the percentage of women across all levels of management. Kinross launched an updated set of leadership principles designed to provide leaders at all levels with clear expectations about what makes a leader at Kinross and how strong leadership enhances business outcomes. Through our support for Skills for Change in Toronto, the Company helped 40 black youth get training in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) subjects.\n\nIn anticipation of Bill S-211, Canada\u2019s Modern Slavery Act, which aims to prevent and reduce the risk of forced labour in supply chains, a human rights task force was established to provide cross-functional coordination on the important work being done in this area and to help prepare the Company\u2019s first modern slavery statement to be published in May 2024.\n\nFor more information on Kinross\u2019 sustainability performance, see the Company\u2019s 2022 Sustainability and ESG Report and its ESG Analyst Centre located on the Company website. The Sustainability and ESG Report follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting standards. The Company\u2019s 2023 Sustainability and ESG Report is expected to be published in May 2024.\n\nExploration update\n\nIn 2023, approximately 300,000 metres of drilling was completed for all exploration projects (brownfields, greenfields, minex).\n\nBrownfields exploration\n\nThe Company\u2019s brownfields exploration efforts \u2013 which accounts for approximately 90% of the Company\u2019s exploration budget \u2013 continued to primarily focus within the footprint of existing mines and projects during 2023.\n\nHighlights of the 2023 brownfields exploration programs include results from: Round Mountain, Curlew Basin, Alaska, Bald Mountain, Tasiast and Chile, as well as Great Bear as detailed on page 6.\n\nRound Mountain\n\nThe Phase X exploration decline that commenced in 2023 is designed to provide a platform for definition drilling of the main Phase X underground target. The exploration program\u00a0plans for definition drill holes in critical areas to test growth potential outward from the main zone of mineralization, in particular testing for continuity of mineralization along strike in areas where surface drilling was limited. Exploration holes are also planned to be drilled at the end of the decline to test for mineralization beyond the planned development. In parallel with developing the decline, Kinross has commenced opportunity drilling between the open pit and the main underground target in Q4 2023.\n\n2023 exploration work at Gold Hill demonstrated significant upside potential at this organic growth target. This year\u2019s work confirmed an 800 metre strike extension of multiple veins yielding high grade intercepts within the Jersey vein zone (D-1195, -94 and -96), suggesting that this robust system continues and remains open (reported in Q2 2023). These results build on successful strike extensions from previous years.\n\nExploration drilling (7,950m) at Gold Hill was accelerated to be completed in the first half of 2023 to fuel studies and initial permitting efforts. Exploration drilling from surface and definition drilling from the bottom of the pit resumed in Q4 2023 and is planned to continue into the first half of 2024.\n\nCurlew Basin\n\nResults at Curlew Basin continue to trend well. At this organic growth project, the 2023 exploration program (16,900m diamond drilling) delivered the following successes:\n\nConfirmed extensions and continuity in several critical vein zones with multiple wide, high-grade intercepts.\n\nST-1312 \u2013 27.1m @ 12.5 g/t Au, includes 10.7m @ 19.9 g/t Au ST-1181 \u2013 2.5m @ 198.4 g/t Au, includes 0.3m @ 1,610.0 g/t Au  Demonstrated upside potential continues with the spatially distinct mineralization at the new \u201cRoadrunner\u201d zone (reported in Q3 14.2m @16.5 g/t Au, includes 7.3m @ 25.3 g/t Au). Underground drilling resumed in Q4 2023 and will be the primary focus for the first half of 2024.  Meaningful resource increase, including a 34% increase in the inferred resource (note: the cut-off date for the 2023 year-end mineral resource estimate precedes the new intercepts listed above).\n\nIn 2024, Kinross plans to follow up on resource growth and new discoveries.\n\nAlaska\n\nDrilling this year in Alaska primarily focused on two main areas: targets for proximal growth around the Fort Knox pit, and targets for potential deeper underground mineralization.\n\nProximal growth highlights include:\n\nFFC23-1879 \u2013 24.7m @ 3.5 g/t Au, includes 3.8m @ 22.7 g/t Au FFC23-1868 \u2013 58.8m @ 0.8 g/t Au FFC23-1903 \u2013 38.7m @ 1.8 g/t Au, includes 6.3m @ 6.0 g/t Au FFC23-1904 \u2013 24.3m @ 1.3 g/t Au, includes 4.0m @ 5.4 g/t Au\n\nUnderground Dandelion shear highlight:\n\nFFC23-1871 \u2013 3.2m @ 25.7 g/t Au\n\nThese proximal growth highlights have not been included in the current resource update and may offer potential to augment medium-term production plans at Fort Knox.\n\nAt Manh Choh, 2,090 metres of drilling was completed across six target areas. The near-mine exploration area was expanded to include several new targets identified along the mine road corridor. Regional reconnaissance work also continued this year and will continue across the greater Tetlin lease area in 2024.\n\nBald Mountain\n\nExploration drilling focused on near-term growth enabling the addition of 78koz. to reserves this year. In 2024, the strategy will continue to focus on low-strip, near-pit extensions across six target areas in the North and South area of operations, as well as test new target areas within the Bida trend.\n\nTasiast\n\nAt Tasiast, exploration drilling resumed in Q4 2023 targeting soil anomalies in the north satellite area on the TMLSA license. The work tested for the potential northern extension of a known structure that forms part of the 75km long Aoueouat Greenstone Belt, hosting Kinross\u2019 known gold deposits. The reverse circulation drill program successfully outlined mineralization and proved the continuity of a known structure. A follow-up drilling program is planned later this year.\n\nReverse circulation drilling of priority targets on the SENISA licenses also began in Q4 2023 and is expected to continue throughout the year. The initial program was designed to test the western extremity of the greenstone belt, roughly 9km due west of Kinross\u2019 Piment deposit, where favorable geochemistry and prospecting had outlined anomalous gold.\n\nDrilling around the existing operations for deep extensions at West Branch, Piment and Prolongation that could support underground mining will be a focus in 2024, with deep drilling expected to begin later this year.\n\nChile\n\nIn Chile, the brownfields drilling program was successful in uncovering potential porphyry mineralization when testing a target at Cerros Bravos on Kinross\u2019 100% owned property. The porphyry is located approximately 8km due north of Kinross\u2019 mine facilities. Follow-up work in 2024 is expected to include geophysics and additional drilling.\n\nAt the La Coipa extensions, approximately ~15,000 metres were drilled in 2023 in and around current and historically active pits to extend oxide mineralization and generate geotechnical and geometallurgical data to support progressing these projects.\n\nBrazil\n\nIn Brazil, brownfields and greenfields exploration efforts are focused on the Company\u2019s extensive land packages, which are primarily along the northwest corridor from the Paracatu mine. Kinross\u2019 land holdings extend for over 35km and are hosted by the sedimentary package that hosts Paracatu. Extensive soil surveying has uncovered numerous anomalies that have been followed up by prospecting, sampling and mapping. Recent drilling of some of these anomalies have revealed similar style mineralization and grades to Paracatu.\n\nIn 2024, Kinross expects to actively drill a number of untested targets and follow up on the best results.\n\nGreenfields exploration update\n\nThe primary greenfields exploration strategy is to identify and explore in areas that have the potential to host high-grade gold deposits. The Company looks for opportunities where it can stake its own claims or collaborate with high-quality junior exploration companies through either joint venture agreements or via equity investment. The primary focus is exploring for orogenic, epithermal, Carlin and intrusion related gold and gold-copper style deposits.\n\nThe greenfields exploration programs in 2023 were focused on targets located in Canada, the USA and Finland with approximately 52,000 metres of drilling completed on all projects.\n\nCanada\n\nOutside of Great Bear, the focus in Canada was on the large land holdings in Snow Lake, Manitoba, where Kinross has 100% ownership in six exploration properties: Laguna, Puella Bay, Lucky Jack, Laguna North, DSN and SLG. Work on the Laguna and the Laguna North properties over the past few years has uncovered gold rich, shear hosted vein systems.\n\nProspecting and mapping on the Laguna North property was successful, with the discovery of a new quartz vein assaying 104.5 g/t Au and 1.8 g/t Ag.\u00a0Kinross plans to follow up in the coming field season with more detailed prospecting and mapping.\n\nHighlights from prospecting and mapping on the SLG property returned 6.0, 7.4, 9.4 and 11.5 g/t Au from mineralized quartz vein material within a shear zone that our geologists have uncovered for over a 200m along strike. Roughly 1.5km due south of the gold showing described above, geologists uncovered veining that contained copper and zinc mineralization with one of the samples returning 0.2 g/t Au, 15.5 g/t Ag, 2.03% Zn and 0.89% Cu. Further work on all of these areas is planned in 2024.\n\nIn February 2023, a joint venture was established with BTU Metals Corp., who holds a large land package abutting the southern boundary of Kinross\u2019 Great Bear project in Red Lake, Ontario. Upon signing the agreement, compilation and modelling work began, and the relogging and sampling of existing core got underway in the second half of the year and will continue in 2024. A drilling program is anticipated at the end of the year, testing the best targets resulting from the relogging and modelling work.\n\nUSA\n\nKinross holds a number of projects in Nevada that are either 100% owned or are in joint venture with private individuals.\n\nWork on Kinross\u2019 various projects consisted of geophysics, prospecting and mapping as well as reverse circulation drilling of targets that were more advanced. A total of 38 reverse circulation drill holes for 12,785 metres, were conducted over the combined land packages during the year. These properties have the potential to host low sulphidation epithermal, Carlin and porphyry style deposits.\n\nWork continues on evaluating and adding new pipeline projects through third party agreements and claim staking opportunities in the principal metallogenic belts throughout the US Great Basin, including the Walker Lane and the primary trends of Carlin-type deposits.\n\nFinland\n\nIn the Central Lapland Greenstone Belt of northern Finland, exploration was conducted on Kinross\u2019 joint venture and 100% owned projects. Kinross\u2019 land positions are proximal to Agnico Eagle\u2019s Kittil\u00e4 Gold mine and Rupert Resource\u2019s Ikkari gold deposit, that has reported more than 4 million ounces at 2.2 g/t Au in indicated resources.\n\nWork in 2023 consisted of prospecting and mapping during the summer months and Base of Till drilling that was conducted throughout the year. The resulting gold anomalies were followed up with diamond drilling. A total of 21 holes for 3,116 metres of core and 10,981 metres of Base of Till drilling was carried out on Kinross\u2019 various properties.\n\nThe latest joint venture agreement was signed with Aurion Resources on August 23, 2023, for its Launi East property. The property hosts the potential for orogenic gold mineralization and contains at least seven gold zones discovered prior to the joint venture. Limited diamond drilling has been carried out over the numerous gold showings and work will build on the existing data and vector in priority areas. Compilation work as well as mapping and Base of Till drilling was undertaken on the property before year end. The results will be followed up in 2024.\n\n2024 Focus\n\nFor 2024, the exploration expenditure guidance (brownfields, greenfields and minex) is $160 million (+/-5%) compared with the $158.9 million spent in 2023. The 2024 programs are designed to follow-up on existing zones of mineralization and to make new discoveries in all of Kinross\u2019 jurisdictions.\n\nLooking at the priority exploration projects:\n\nAt Great Bear, expand the mineralized zones, LP, Hinge and Limb, and explore for new mineralization on Kinross\u2019 land package At Curlew, expand on the existing resource and follow-up on the newly discovered high-grade mineralization at Roadrunner At Round Mountain, begin to delineate the Phase X mineralization from the underground exploration decline. Additional drilling from surface and the bottom of the pit at Gold Hill will test the numerous, high-grade gold veins At Tasiast, underground-focused drilling from surface at Piment and West Branch and exploration of the SENISA and TMLSA land packages In Chile, a number of greenfields and brownfields targets will be drill tested over the course of the year and the porphyry mineralization at Cerros Bravos will be followed up At Paracatu, expand regional exploration activities In Canada, continue to explore the Snow Lake, Manitoba, land package\n\nAppendix C: Refer to page 42 of this news release for supplementary illustrations.\n\nFull drill results are available here: www.kinross.com/Exploration-Drill-Results-Appendix-C-Q4-YE-2023\n\n2023 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources update (See the Company\u2019s detailed Annual Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Statement estimated as at December 31, 2023 and explanatory notes starting at page 32.)\n\nKinross maintained its gold price assumptions of $1,400 per ounce and $1,700 per ounce for its mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, respectively, as of December 31, 202310.\n\nThe Company also maintained its silver price assumption of $17.50 per ounce and of $21.30 per ounce for its mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates5.\n\nKinross continues to prioritize quality, high-margin, low-cost ounces in its portfolio, and maintained its fully loaded costing methodology.\n\nKinross is focused on upgrading the quality of its resources and delineating high-grade gold ounces with the objective of converting to reserves. While there was an overall reduction in reserves at year-end 2023, additions to resources are primarily high-grade ounces driven by the substantial increase at Great Bear.\n\nKinross Gold Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates19 2022\r\n(Au koz) Depletion\r\n(Au koz) Geology & Engineering\r\n(Au koz) 2023\r\n(Au koz) Proven and Probable Reserves 25,535 (2,435) (344) 22,757 Measured and Indicated Resources 26,211 (69) (174) 25,968 Inferred Resources 10,522 (85) 1,049 11,484\n\nProven and Probable Mineral Reserves\n\nKinross\u2019 total proven and probable mineral reserve estimates decreased by 11%, or 2.8 million Au oz., to 22.8 million Au oz. at year-end 2023 compared with 25.5 million Au oz. at year-end 2022. The net decrease was mostly due to depletion, with an additional decrease of 0.4 million Au oz. at Paracatu due to geological and engineering updates, with decreases offset by an increase of 0.1 million Au oz. at Bald Mountain due to the addition of several smaller pits (converting from resource).\n\nThe Company\u2019s total proven and probable silver mineral reserve estimate decreased by 34% or 12.4 million Ag oz. to 23.7 million Ag oz. at year-end 2023 compared with 36.1 million Ag oz. at year-end 2022. The net decrease was mostly due to depletion at La Coipa.\n\nMeasured and Indicated Mineral Resources\n\nKinross\u2019 total measured and indicated mineral resource estimate at year-end 2023 was 26.0 million Au oz. compared with 26.2 million Au oz. at year-end 2022. The slight reduction was largely a result of increased costs at Paracatu, Fort Knox and small conversions of mineral resources to mineral reserves at Bald Mountain. Decreases were offset by a geologic increase at Tasiast.\n\nThe Company\u2019s total measured and indicated silver resources decreased by 10% to 34.0 million Ag oz. at year-end 2023 compared with 37.6 million Ag oz. at year-end 2022.\n\nInferred Mineral Resources\n\nKinross\u2019 total inferred mineral resource estimate increased by 9% or 1.0 million Au oz. to 11.5 million Au oz. at year-end 2023, compared with 10.5 million Au oz. at year-end 2022. The increase can be attributed to Great Bear which added 1.0 million ounces of inferred material, and Curlew Basin (Kettle River).\n\nThe Company\u2019s total inferred silver resources decreased by 13% to 4.0 million Ag oz. at year-end 2023 compared with 4.6 million Ag oz. at year-end 2022.\n\nBoard update\n\nMr. Ian Atkinson, who has been a Board member since February 2016, will, pursuant to Kinross\u2019 retirement policy, be retiring and not stand for re-election at the Company\u2019s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2024. Kinross\u2019 management and Board would like to thank Mr. Atkinson for his many contributions during his tenure, including those related to his role as Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and his membership on the Corporate Responsibility and Technical Committee and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Kinross has appointed Mr. George Paspalas as a Director with an effective date of January 1, 2024.

Recovery rates at Fort Knox and Round Mountain represent mill recovery only. (b) Gold equivalent ounces include silver ounces produced and sold converted to a gold equivalent based on the ratio of the average spot market prices for the commodities for each period. The ratios for the quarters presented are as follows: Q4 2023: 85:1; Q3 2023: 81.82:1; Q2 2023: 81.88:1; Q1 2023: 83.82:1; Q4 2022: 81.88:1. (c) \u201cProduction cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold from continuing operations. (d) \"nm\" means not meaningful. (e) \"Total Cap Ex\" is as reported as \u201cAdditions to property, plant and equipment\u201d on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \"Capital expenditures - sustaining\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition and reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is included on page 30 of this news release. (f) La Coipa silver grade and recovery were as follows: Q4 2023: 96.24 g/t, 44%; Q3 2023: 106.70 g/t, 63%; Q2 2023: 109.84 g/t, 56%; Q1 2023: 125.77 g/t, 70%; Q4 2022: 137.53 g/t, 68%.\n\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and ratios\n\nThe Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios in this document. These financial measures and ratios are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these financial measures and ratios, together with financial measures and ratios determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these financial measures and ratios is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures and ratios are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\n\nAll the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios in this document are from continuing operations and exclude results from the Company\u2019s Chirano and Russian operations due to the classification of these operations as discontinued and their sale in 2022. As a result of the exclusion of Chirano, the following non-GAAP financial measures and ratios are no longer on an attributable basis, but on a total basis: production cost of sales from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis and all-in-sustaining cost from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold and per ounce sold on a by-product basis.\n\nAdjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations per Share\n\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios which determine the performance of the Company, excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period, such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, reassessment of prior year taxes and/or taxes otherwise not related to the current period, impairment charges (reversals), gains and losses and other one-time costs related to acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions, and non-hedge derivative gains and losses. Although some of the items are recurring, the Company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Management believes that these measures and ratios, which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results, provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance, particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance. However, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per share measures and ratios are not necessarily indicative of net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share measures and ratios as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted net earnings from continuing operations for the periods presented:\n\n(expressed in millions of U.S dollars, Three months ended Years ended except per share amounts) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders - as reported $ 65.4  $ (106.0 ) $ 416.3  $ 31.9 Adjusting items: Foreign exchange losses (gains) 2.7  (0.7 ) 1.9  (0.8 ) Foreign exchange losses (gains) on translation of tax basis and foreign exchange\u00a0on deferred income taxes within income tax expense 24.1  (17.1 ) 29.3  (25.5 ) Taxes in respect of prior periods (19.9 ) 0.4 13.9  16.2 Impairment charges and asset derecognition(a) 38.9  350.0 38.9  350.0 Restructuring costs -  - -  13.0 Reclamation (recovery) expense (5.1 ) 19.6 (19.2 ) 23.5 VAT expense (recovery) in respect of prior periods -  (24.2 ) 8.5  (24.2 ) Tasiast insurance recoveries -  (77.1 ) -  (77.1 ) Loss on sale of assets 8.1  12.1 14.8  14.3 Settlement provisions 20.0  - 30.0  - Other(b) 8.2  16.4 9.6  22.6 Tax effects of the above adjustments (2.4 ) (65.2 ) (4.2 ) (60.8 ) 74.6  214.2 123.5  251.2 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ 140.0  $ 108.2 $ 539.8  $ 283.1 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 1,227.8  1,258.4 1,227.0  1,280.5 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per share $ 0.11  $ 0.09 $ 0.44  $ 0.22 Basic earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders\u00a0- as reported $ 0.06  $ (0.08 ) $ 0.34  $ 0.02\n\n(a) During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment charges of $38.9 million related to a reduction in the estimate of recoverable ounces on the Fort Knox heap leach pads due to changes in recovery rates. The tax impact of the impairment was an income tax recovery of $3.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized impairment charges of $350.0 million at Round Mountain, of which $106.8 million related to impairment of metal inventory and $243.2 million related to impairment of property, plant and equipment. The income tax recoveries related to the impairment charges were $18.9 million and $41.8 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized impairment and asset derecognition charges of $144.5 million at Bald Mountain, of which $95.2 million related to impairment of metal inventory and $49.3 million related to the derecognition of property, plant and equipment. The income tax recoveries related to the impairment charges were $25.3 million and $13.1 million, respectively. (b) Other includes various impacts, such as one-time costs at sites, and gains and losses on hedges, which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period.\n\nAttributable Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations\n\nAttributable free cash flow is defined as net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities less attributable capital expenditures and non-controlling interest included in net cash flow from operating activities. The Company believes that this measure, which is used internally to evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying cash generation performance and the ability to repay creditors and return cash to shareholders, provides investors with the ability to better evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying performance. However, this measure is not necessarily indicative of operating earnings or net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities, as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of attributable free cash flow from continuing operations for the periods presented:\n\nThree months ended Years ended (expressed in millions of U.S dollars)  December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities - as reported $ 410.9  $ 474.3 $ 1,605.3  $ 1,002.5 Less: Attributable capital expenditures $ (297.7 ) $ (312.7 ) $ (1,055.0 ) $ (755.0 ) Less Non-controlling interest cash flow (from) used in operating activities(j) 3.5  1.0 9.4  (0.2 ) Attributable free cash flow from continuing operations $ 116.7  $ 162.6 $ 559.7  $ 247.3\n\nSee page 31 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAdjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital. Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors, including the timing of tax payments. The Company uses adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow-generating capability of the Company. However, the adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations measure is not necessarily indicative of net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities as determined under IFRS.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations for the periods presented:\n\nThree months ended Years ended (expressed in millions of U.S dollars) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net cash flow of continuing operations provided from operating activities - as reported $ 410.9  $ 474.3 $ 1,605.3  $ 1,002.5 Adjusting items: Working capital changes: Accounts receivable and other assets (2.1 ) 29.1 (68.7 ) (17.9 ) Inventories (1.8 ) 39.2 91.4  261.6 Accounts payable and other liabilities, including income taxes paid 0.4  (46.5 ) 41.9  10.3 Total working capital changes (3.5 ) 21.8 64.6  254.0 Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations $ 407.4  $ 496.1 $ 1,669.9  $ 1,256.5\n\nProduction cost of sales from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP ratio which calculates the Company\u2019s non-gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs, rather than converting its non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production, as is the case in co-product accounting. Management believes that this ratio provides investors with the ability to better evaluate Kinross\u2019 production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by-product accounting rather than co-product accounting.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of production cost of sales from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis for the periods presented:\n\n(expressed in millions of U.S. dollars,  Three months ended Years ended except ounces and production cost of sales per equivalent ounce) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Production cost of sales from continuing operations - as reported $ 552.0  $ 526.5 $ 2,054.4  $ 1,805.7 Less: silver revenue(a) (43.7 ) (61.9 ) (204.3 ) (98.9 ) Production cost of sales from continuing operations net of silver by-product revenue $ 508.3  $ 464.6 $ 1,850.1  $ 1,706.8 Gold ounces sold from continuing operations 543,173  586,146 2,074,989  1,872,342 Total gold equivalent ounces sold from continuing operations 565,389  620,599 2,179,936  1,927,818 Production cost of sales from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold(b) $ 976  $ 848 $ 942  $ 937 Production cost of sales from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 936  $ 793 $ 892  $ 912\n\nSee page 31\u00a0for details of the footnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, as applicable, calculated based on guidance published by the World Gold Council (\u201cWGC\u201d). The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including Kinross. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these metrics. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, these measures and ratios presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures and ratios presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost measures complement existing measures and ratios reported by Kinross.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. The value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production, i.e. a by-product. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production. Sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs, including capitalized stripping, and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\n\nAll-in cost is comprised of all-in sustaining cost as well as operating expenditures incurred at locations with no current operation, or costs related to other non-sustaining activities, and capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis are calculated by adjusting production cost of sales from continuing operations, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, as follows:\n\n(expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, Three months ended Years ended except ounces and costs per ounce) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Production cost of sales from continuing operations - as reported $ 552.0  $ 526.5 $ 2,054.4  $ 1,805.7 Less: silver revenue from continuing operations(a) (43.7 ) (61.9 ) (204.3 ) (98.9 ) Production cost of sales from continuing operations net of silver by-product revenue $ 508.3  $ 464.6 $ 1,850.1  $ 1,706.8 Adjusting items: General and administrative(d) 26.5  29.3 106.9  116.8 Other operating expense - sustaining(e) 5.2  5.0 23.0  28.5 Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(f) 16.4  14.2 63.1  42.7 Exploration and business development - sustaining(g) 10.4  7.7 38.3  30.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(h) 150.1  178.0 554.3  402.6 Lease payments - sustaining(i) 4.6  6.1 29.5  22.4 All-in Sustaining Cost on a by-product basis $ 721.5  $ 704.9 $ 2,665.2  $ 2,350.4 Adjusting items on an attributable(c) basis: Other operating expense - non-sustaining(e) 11.1  12.8 38.5  45.1 Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(f) 2.2  1.9 7.7  8.0 Exploration and business development - non-sustaining(g) 40.1  40.1 145.9  122.3 Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(h) 147.6  134.4 500.7  352.4 Lease payments - non-sustaining(i) 0.1  - 0.7  0.8 All-in Cost on a by-product basis - attributable(c) $ 922.6  $ 894.1 $ 3,358.7  $ 2,879.0 Gold ounces sold from continuing operations 543,173  586,146 2,074,989  1,872,342 Production cost of sales from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold(b) $ 976  $ 848 $ 942  $ 937 All-in sustaining cost from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 1,328  $ 1,203 $ 1,284  $ 1,255 Attributable(c) all-in cost from continuing operations per ounce sold on a by-product basis $ 1,699  $ 1,525 $ 1,619  $ 1,538\n\nSee page 31\u00a0for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nThe Company also assesses its all-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost from continuing operations on a gold equivalent ounce basis. Under these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, the Company\u2019s production of silver is converted into gold equivalent ounces and credited to total production.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost and attributable all-in cost from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold are calculated by adjusting production cost of sales from continuing operations, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, as follows:\n\n(expressed in millions of U.S. dollars, Three months ended Years ended except ounces and costs per ounce) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Production cost of sales from continuing operations - as reported $ 552.0  $ 526.5 $ 2,054.4  $ 1,805.7 Adjusting items: General and administrative(d) 26.5  29.3 106.9  116.8 Other operating expense - sustaining(e) 5.2  5.0 23.0  28.5 Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(f) 16.4  14.2 63.1  42.7 Exploration and business development - sustaining(g) 10.4  7.7 38.3  30.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(h) 150.1  178.0 554.3  402.6 Lease payments - sustaining(i) 4.6  6.1 29.5  22.4 All-in Sustaining Cost $ 765.2  $ 766.8 $ 2,869.5  $ 2,449.3 Adjusting items on an attributable(c) basis: Other operating expense - non-sustaining(e) 11.1  12.8 38.5  45.1 Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(f) 2.2  1.9 7.7  8.0 Exploration and business development - non-sustaining(g) 40.1  40.1 145.9  122.3 Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(h) 147.6  134.4 500.7  352.4 Lease payments - non-sustaining(i) 0.1  - 0.7  0.8 All-in Cost - attributable(c) $ 966.3  $ 956.0 $ 3,563.0  $ 2,977.9 Gold equivalent ounces sold from continuing operations 565,389  620,599 2,179,936  1,927,818 Production cost of sales from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold(b) $ 976  $ 848 $ 942  $ 937 All-in sustaining cost from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold $ 1,353  $ 1,236 $ 1,316  $ 1,271 Attributable(c) all-in cost from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold $ 1,709  $ 1,540 $ 1,634  $ 1,545\n\nSee page 31\u00a0for details of the endnotes\u00a0referenced within the table above.\n\nCapital Expenditures and Attributable Capital Expenditures From Continuing Operations\n\nCapital expenditures are classified as either sustaining capital expenditures or non-sustaining capital expenditures, depending on the nature of the expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditures typically represent capital expenditures at existing operations including capitalized exploration costs and capitalized stripping unless related to major projects, ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and other capital expenditures and is calculated as total additions to property, plant and equipment (as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows), less non-sustaining capital expenditures. Non-sustaining capital expenditures represent capital expenditures for major projects, including major capital stripping projects at existing operations that are expected to materially benefit the operation, as well as enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Management believes the distinction between sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures is a useful indicator for the purpose of capital expenditures and this distinction is an input into the calculation of all-in sustaining costs from continuing operations per ounce and attributable all-in costs from continuing operations per ounce. The categorization of sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures is consistent with the definitions under the WGC all-in cost standard. Sustaining capital expenditures and non-sustaining capital expenditures are not defined under IFRS, however, the sum of these two measures total to additions to property, plant and equipment as disclosed under IFRS on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Additions to property, plant and equipment per the statement of cash flow includes 100% of capital expenditures for Manh Choh. Attributable capital expenditures includes Kinross' 70% share of capital expenditures for Manh Choh. Management believes this to be a useful indicator of Kinross\u2019 cash resources utilized for capital expenditures.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the classification of capital expenditures for the periods presented:\n\n(expressed in millions of U.S dollars) Three months ended December 31, 2023: Tasiast (Mauritania) Paracatu (Brazil) La Coipa (Chile) Fort Knox (USA) Round Mountain (USA) Bald Mountain (USA) Manh Choh (USA) Total USA Other Total Sustaining capital expenditures $ 9.7  $ 41.6  $ 7.0  $ 50.6  $ 4.6  $ 36.3  $ -  $ 91.5  $ 0.3  $ 150.1  Non-sustaining capital expenditures 75.5  -  3.9  18.4  0.2  2.5  45.1  66.2  15.6  161.2  Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 85.2  $ 41.6  $ 10.9  $ 69.0  $ 4.8  $ 38.8  $ 45.1  $ 157.7  $ 15.9  $ 311.3  Less: Non-controlling interest(j) -  -  -  -  -  -  (13.6 ) (13.6 ) -  (13.6 ) Attributable capital expenditures(c) $ 85.2  $ 41.6  $ 10.9  $ 69.0  $ 4.8  $ 38.8  $ 31.5  $ 144.1  $ 15.9  $ 297.7  Three months ended December 31, 2022: Sustaining capital expenditures $ 38.3 $ 43.9 $ 2.6 $ 34.4 $ 41.1 $ 17.2 $ - $ 92.7 $ 0.8 $ 178.3 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 52.0 - 43.4 4.7 - 20.2 17.1 42.0 1.1 138.5 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 90.3 $ 43.9 $ 46.0 $ 39.1 $ 41.1 $ 37.4 $ 17.1 $ 134.7 $ 1.9 $ 316.8 Less: Non-controlling interest(j) - - - - - - (4.1 ) (4.1 ) - (4.1 ) Attributable capital expenditures(c) $ 90.3 $ 43.9 $ 46.0 $ 39.1 $ 41.1 $ 37.4 $ 13.0 $ 130.6 $ 1.9 $ 312.7 (expressed in millions of U.S dollars) Year ended December 31, 2023: Tasiast (Mauritania) Paracatu (Brazil) La Coipa (Chile) Fort Knox (USA) Round Mountain (USA) Bald Mountain (USA) Manh Choh (USA) Total USA Other Total Sustaining capital expenditures $ 45.6  $ 167.5  $ 36.0  $ 193.4  $ 30.2  $ 79.5  $ -  $ 303.1  $ 2.1  $ 554.3  Non-sustaining capital expenditures 263.4  -  38.8  30.7  0.3  40.8  144.3  216.1  25.7  544.0  Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 309.0  $ 167.5  $ 74.8  $ 224.1  $ 30.5  $ 120.3  $ 144.3  $ 519.2  $ 27.8  $ 1,098.3  Less: Non-controlling interest(j) -  -  -  -  -  -  (43.3 ) (43.3 ) -  (43.3 ) Attributable capital expenditures(c) $ 309.0  $ 167.5  $ 74.8  $ 224.1  $ 30.5  $ 120.3  $ 101.0  $ 475.9  $ 27.8  $ 1,055.0  Year ended December 31, 2022: Sustaining capital expenditures $ 52.7 $ 124.7 $ 7.8 $ 78.7 $ 102.2 $ 35.3 $ - $ 216.2 $ 1.2 $ 402.6 Non-sustaining capital expenditures 114.7 - 147.7 7.4 0.2 52.3 33.2 93.1 6.1 361.6 Additions to property, plant and equipment - per cash flow $ 167.4 $ 124.7 $ 155.5 $ 86.1 $ 102.4 $ 87.6 $ 33.2 $ 309.3 $ 7.3 $ 764.2 Less: Non-controlling interest(j) - - - - - - (9.2 ) (9.2 ) - (9.2 ) Attributable capital expenditures(c) $ 167.4 $ 124.7 $ 155.5 $ 86.1 $ 102.4 $ 87.6 $ 24.0 $ 300.1 $ 7.3 $ 755.0\n\nSee page 31 for details of the endnotes referenced within the table above.\n\nEndnotes\n\n(a) \u201cSilver revenue\u201d represents the portion of metal sales realized from the production of the secondary or by-product metal (i.e. silver). Revenue from the sale of silver, which is produced as a by-product of the process used to produce gold, effectively reduces the cost of gold production  (b) \u201cProduction cost of sales from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales from continuing operations divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold from continuing operations. (c) \u201cAttributable\u201d includes Kinross\u2019 share of Manh Choh (70%) free cash flow, costs and capital expenditures. As Manh Choh is a non-operating site, the attributable costs and capital expenditures are non-sustaining and as such only impact the all-in-cost measures. (d) \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d expenses is as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, net of certain restructuring expenses. General and administrative expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required to be absorbed on a continuing basis for the effective operation and governance of the Company. (e) \u201cOther operating expense \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cOther operating expense\u201d as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, less other operating and reclamation and remediation expenses related to non-sustaining activities as well as other items not reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. Other operating expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on the type and location of the expenditure incurred. The majority of other operating expenses that are incurred at existing operations are considered costs necessary to sustain operations, and are therefore classified as sustaining. Other operating expenses incurred at locations where there is no current operation or related to other non-sustaining activities are classified as non-sustaining. (f) \u201cReclamation and remediation - sustaining\u201d is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets, and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines. Reclamation and remediation costs for development projects or closed mines are excluded from this amount and classified as non-sustaining. (g) \u201cExploration and business development \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cExploration and business development\u201d expenses as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, less non-sustaining exploration and business development expenses. Exploration expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type and location of the exploration expenditure. Exploration expenditures within the footprint of operating mines are considered costs required to sustain current operations and so are included in sustaining costs. Exploration expenditures focused on new ore bodies near existing mines (i.e. brownfield), new exploration projects (i.e. greenfield) or for other generative exploration activity not linked to existing mining operations are classified as non-sustaining. Business development expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type of expense and requirement for general or growth related operations. (h) \u201cAdditions to property, plant and equipment \u2013 sustaining and non-sustaining are as presented on page 30. Non-sustaining capital expenditures included in the calculation of attributable all-in-cost includes Kinross\u2019 share of Manh Choh (70%) costs. (i) \u201cLease payments \u2013 sustaining\u201d represents the majority of lease payments as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is made up of the principal and financing components of such cash payments, less non-sustaining lease payments. Lease payments for development projects or closed mines are classified as non-sustaining. (j) Non-controlling interest\u201d represents the non-controlling interest portion in Manh Choh (30%) and other subsidiaries for which the Company\u2019s interest is less than 100% for cash flow from operating activities and capital expenditures.\n\n2023 Annual Mineral Reserve and Resource Statement\n\nProven and Probable Mineral Reserves\n\nMINERAL RESERVE AND MINERAL RESOURCE STATEMENT GOLD

based on an assumed gold price of $1,400 per ounce and a silver price of $17.50 per ounce. Mineral reserves are estimated using appropriate process recoveries, operating costs and mine plans that are unique to each property and include estimated allowances for dilution and mining recovery. Mineral reserve estimates are reported in contained units based on Kinross' interest and are estimated based on the following foreign exchange rates:\n\nCanadian Dollar to $US 1.30\r\nChilean Peso to $US 850.00\r\nBrazilian Real to $US 5.00\r\nMauritanian Ouguiya to $US 35.00\n\n(2) The mineral reserve estimates for Lobo Marte assume a $1,200 per ounce gold price and foreign exchange rate assumption of Chilean Peso to $US 800.00 are based on the 2021 Feasibility Study.\n\n(3) The Company\u2019s mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates as at December 31, 2023 are classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) \u201cCIM Definition Standards \u2011 For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\u201d adopted by the CIM Council (as amended, the \u201cCIM Definition Standards\u201d) in accordance with the requirements of National Instrument 43\u2011101 \u201cStandards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\u201d (\u201cNI 43\u2011101\u201d). Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates reflect the Company\u2019s reasonable expectation that all necessary permits and approvals will be obtained and maintained.\n\n(4) Cautionary note to U.S. investors concerning estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources. These estimates have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the requirements of United States\u2019 securities laws. The terms \u201cmineral reserve\u201d, \u201cproven mineral reserve\u201d, \u201cprobable mineral reserve\u201d, \u201cmineral resource\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resource\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resource\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43\u2011101 and the CIM Definition Standards. These definitions differ from the definitions in subpart 1300 of Regulation S\u2011K (\u201cSubpart 1300\u201d), which replaced the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Industry Guide 7 as part of the SEC\u2019s amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements. These amendments became effective February 25, 2019 and registrants are required to comply with the Subpart 1300 provisions by their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. While the definitions in Subpart 1300 are more similar to the definitions in NI 43\u2011101 and the CIM Definitions Standard than were the Industry Guide 7 provisions due to the adoption in Subpart 1300 of terms describing mineral reserves and mineral resources that are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the corresponding terms under the CIM Definition Standards, including the SEC now recognizing estimates of \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d and amending its definitions of \u201cproven mineral reserves\u201d and \u201cprobable mineral reserves\u201d to be \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the corresponding CIM Definitions, the definitions in Subpart 1300 still differ from the requirements of, and the definitions in, NI 43\u2011101 and the CIM Definition Standards. U.S. investors are cautioned that while the above terms are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions in Subpart 1300 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \u201cproven mineral reserves\u201d, \u201cprobable mineral reserves\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d under NI 43\u2011101 would be the same had the Company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards set forth in Subpart 1300. U.S. investors are also cautioned that while the SEC recognizes \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d under Subpart 1300, investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d exist. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d may not form the basis of feasibility or pre\u2011feasibility studies, except in rare cases. As a foreign private issuer that files its annual report on Form 40\u2011F with the SEC pursuant to the multi\u2011jurisdictional disclosure system, the Company is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the Subpart 1300 provisions and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43\u2011101 and the CIM Definition Standards. If the Company ceases to be a foreign private issuer or loses its eligibility to file its annual report on Form 40\u2011F pursuant to the multi\u2011jurisdictional disclosure system, then the Company will be subject to reporting pursuant to the Subpart 1300 provisions, which differ from the requirements of NI 43\u2011101 and the CIM Definition Standards.\n\nFor the above reasons, the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and related information in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n\n(5) The Company\u2019s mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates were prepared under the supervision of and verified by Mr. Nicos Pfeiffer, who is a qualified person as defined by NI 43\u2011101.\n\n(6) The Company\u2019s normal data verification procedures have been used in collecting, compiling, interpreting and processing the data used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resource.\n\n(7) Rounding of values to the 000s may result in apparent discrepancies.\n\n(8) Round Mountain refers to the Round Mountain project, which includes the Round Mountain deposit and the Gold Hill deposit. The Round Mountain deposit does not contain silver and all silver resources at Round Mountain are contained exclusively within the Gold Hill deposit. Disclosure of gold mineral reserves and mineral resources reflect both the Round Mountain deposit and the Gold Hill deposit. Disclosure of silver mineral reserves and mineral resources reflect only the Gold Hill deposit.\n\n(9) Includes mineral resources and mineral reserves from the Puren deposit in which the Company holds a 65% interest; as well as mineral resources from the Catalina deposit, in which the Company holds a 50% interest.\n\n(10) Mineral resources are exclusive of mineral reserves.\n\n(11) Unless otherwise noted, the Company\u2019s mineral resources are estimated using appropriate cut-off grades based on a gold price of $1,700 per ounce and a silver price of $21.3 per ounce. Foreign exchange rates for estimating mineral resources were the same as for mineral reserves.\n\n(12) The mineral resource estimates for Lobo Marte assume a $1,600 per ounce gold price and are based on the 2021 Feasibility Study.\n\n(13) Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have to demonstrate economic viability. Mineral resources are subject to infill drilling, permitting, mine planning, mining dilution and recovery losses, among other things, to be converted into mineral reserves. Due to the uncertainty associated with inferred mineral resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources, including as a result of continued exploration.\n\nMineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Definitions\n\nA \u2018Mineral Resource\u2019 is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth\u2019s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling.\n\nAn \u2018Inferred Mineral Resource\u2019 is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.\n\nAn \u2018Indicated Mineral Resource\u2019 is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve.\n\nA \u2018Measured Mineral Resource\u2019 is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.\n\nA \u2018Mineral Reserve\u2019 is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. The reference point at which Mineral Reserves are defined, usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations where the reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported. The public disclosure of a Mineral Reserve must be demonstrated by a Pre-Feasibility Study or Feasibility Study.\n\nA \u2018Probable Mineral Reserve\u2019 is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve.\n\nA \u2018Proven Mineral Reserve\u2019 is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nRecent LP zone assay results\n\nHole ID From \r\n(m) To \r\n(m) Width \r\n(m) True \r\nWidth (m)

(2) permitting, development, operations and production from the Company\u2019s operations and development projects being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations including, without limitation: the maintenance of existing permits and approvals and the timely receipt of all permits and authorizations necessary for the operation of Tasiast; water and power supply and continued operation of the tailings reprocessing facility at Paracatu; permitting of the Great Bear project (including the consultation process with Indigenous groups), permitting and development of the Lobo-Marte project; in each case in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations; and the successful completion of exploration consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations at the Company\u2019s projects; (3) political and legal developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations including, without limitation, restrictions or penalties imposed, or actions taken, by any government, including but not limited to amendments to the mining laws, and potential power rationing and tailings facility regulations in Brazil (including those related to financial assurance requirements), potential amendments to water laws and/or other water use restrictions and regulatory actions in Chile, new dam safety regulations, potential amendments to minerals and mining laws and energy levies laws, new regulations relating to work permits, potential amendments to customs and mining laws (including but not limited to amendments to the VAT) and the potential application of the tax code in Mauritania, potential amendments to and enforcement of tax laws in Mauritania (including, but not limited to, the interpretation, implementation, application and enforcement of any such laws and amendments thereto), potential third party legal challenges to existing permits, and the impact of any trade tariffs being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (4) the completion of studies, including scoping studies, preliminary economic assessments, pre-feasibility or feasibility studies, on the timelines currently expected and the results of those studies being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (5) the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Mauritanian ouguiya and the U.S. dollar being approximately consistent with current levels; (6) certain price assumptions for gold and silver; (7) prices for diesel, natural gas, fuel oil, electricity and other key supplies being approximately consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations; (8) attributable production and cost of sales forecasts for the Company meeting expectations;

(10) labour and materials costs increasing on a basis consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (11) the terms and conditions of the legal and fiscal stability agreements for Tasiast being interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with their intent and Kinross\u2019 expectations and without material amendment or formal dispute (including without limitation the application of tax, customs and duties exemptions and royalties); (12) asset impairment potential; (13) the regulatory and legislative regime regarding mining, electricity production and transmission (including rules related to power tariffs) in Brazil being consistent with Kinross\u2019 current expectations; (14) access to capital markets, including but not limited to maintaining our current credit ratings consistent with the Company\u2019s current expectations; (15) potential direct or indirect operational impacts resulting from infectious diseases or pandemics; (16) changes in national and local government legislation or other government actions, including the Canadian federal impact assessment regime; (17) litigation, regulatory proceedings and audits, and the potential ramifications thereof, being concluded in a manner consistent with the Corporation\u2019s expectations (including without limitation litigation in Chile relating to the alleged damage of wetlands and the scope of any remediation plan or other environmental obligations arising therefrom);

Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the inaccuracy of any of the foregoing assumptions; fluctuations in the currency markets; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold or certain other commodities (such as fuel and electricity); price inflation of goods and services; changes in the discount rates applied to calculate the present value of net future cash flows based on country-specific real weighted average cost of capital; changes in the market valuations of peer group gold producers and the Company, and the resulting impact on market price to net asset value multiples; changes in various market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, gold or silver prices and lease rates, or global fuel prices, that could impact the mark-to-market value of outstanding derivative instruments and ongoing payments/receipts under any financial obligations; risks arising from holding derivative instruments (such as credit risk, market liquidity risk and mark-to-market risk); changes in national and local government legislation, taxation (including but not limited to income tax, advance income tax, stamp tax, withholding tax, capital tax, tariffs, value-added or sales tax, capital outflow tax, capital gains tax, windfall or windfall profits tax, production royalties, excise tax, customs/import or export taxes/duties, asset taxes, asset transfer tax, property use or other real estate tax, together with any related fine, penalty, surcharge, or interest imposed in connection with such taxes), controls, policies and regulations; the security of personnel and assets; political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Chile, Brazil, Mauritania or other countries in which Kinross does business or may carry on business; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, us; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and complete divestitures; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining, development or refining activities; employee relations; litigation or other claims against, or regulatory investigations and/or any enforcement actions, administrative orders or sanctions in respect of the Company (and/or its directors, officers, or employees) including, but not limited to, securities class action litigation in Canada and/or the United States, environmental litigation or regulatory proceedings or any investigations, enforcement actions and/or sanctions under any applicable anti-corruption, international sanctions and/or anti-money laundering laws and regulations in Canada, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction; the speculative nature of gold exploration and development including, but not limited to, the risks of obtaining and maintaining necessary licenses and permits; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; adverse changes in our credit ratings; and contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or the inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can directly or indirectly affect, and could cause, Kinross\u2019 actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Kinross, including but not limited to resulting in an impairment charge on goodwill and/or assets. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management\u2019s expectations and plans relating to the future. All of the forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by this cautionary statement and those made in our other filings with the securities regulators of Canada and the United States including, but not limited to, the cautionary statements made in the \u201cRisk Analysis\u201d section of our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth in the Company\u2019s Annual Information Form dated March 31, 2023. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Kinross.

Attributable guidance figures are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios. Refer to footnote 3. \r\n2 \u201cProduction cost of sales from continuing operations per equivalent ounce sold\u201d is defined as production cost of sales, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold from continuing operations.\r\n3 These figures are non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, as applicable. They are defined and actual results are reconciled on pages 26 to 30 of this news release.

The ETR does not include the impact of items which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance, such as the impact of net foreign currency translations on tax deductions and taxes related to prior periods. Management believes that the ETR range provides investors with the ability to better evaluate the Company\u2019s underlying performance. However, the ETR range is not necessarily an indicator of tax expense recognized under IFRS. The rate is sensitive to the relative proportion of sales between the Company\u2019s various tax jurisdictions and realized gold prices.\r\n18 DD&A ($/oz) is defined as depreciation, depletion and amortization, as reported on the consolidated statements of operations, divided by total gold equivalent ounces sold from continuing operations.\r\n19 Please see page 35 for Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Statement Notes\r\n20 Rounding of values to the 000s may result in apparent discrepancies. 21 Refers to all of the currencies in the countries where the Company has mining operations, fluctuating simultaneously by 10% in the same direction, either appreciating or depreciating, taking into consideration the impact of hedging and the weighting of each currency within our consolidated cost structure.",

        "title": "Should You Buy Kinross (KGC) Ahead of Earnings?",
        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Kinross Gold Corporation KGC may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because Kinross is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for KGC in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 11 cents per share for KGC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for KGC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +13.51% heading into earnings season.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kinross Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nKinross Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Kinross Gold Corporation Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that KGC has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Kinross, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Now",
        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 three days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 15, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.49 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.46 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Agnico Eagle Mines has an Earnings ESP of 5.42%.\n\nAEM is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Kinross Gold (KGC).\n\nKinross Gold is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 14, 2024.

        "title": "Barrick (GOLD) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
        "content": "Barrick Gold Corporation GOLD is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results before the opening bell on Feb 14.\r\n\r\nThe gold mining giant surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15.4%. It posted an earnings surprise of 14.3% in the last reported quarter. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter results are expected to have benefited from sequentially higher gold production and prices. However, higher costs are likely to have affected its performance.\r\n\r\nThe stock is down 18.2% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 6.9% decline. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhat Do the Estimates Say?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter consolidated revenues for Barrick is currently pegged at $3,131.6 million, which calls for a rise of around 12.9% year over year.\n\nSome Factors to Watch For\n\nHigher gold production is likely have aided the company\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported. Barrick, last month, said that its preliminary gold production in the fourth quarter was higher than the third quarter, representing the highest quarter for the year. Production was driven by notable contributions from Cortez, Phoenix and Pueblo Viejo. This was partly offset by lower production at Loulo-Gounkoto. In terms of copper production, preliminary fourth-quarter production remained consistent with the third quarter across all three sites.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for the attributable gold production is pegged at 1,195, 000 ounces for the quarter to be reported, which suggests a 15% increase on a sequential basis. The same for copper production is pegged at 134 million pounds, reflecting a sequential increase of 19.6%.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s performance in the December quarter is likely to have been impacted by higher costs. GOLD expects fourth-quarter gold cost of sales per ounce to be 6-8% higher compared with third-quarter levels, with total cash costs per ounce and all-in sustaining costs per ounce anticipated to be 7-9% and 8-10% higher, respectively.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, gold had a solid fourth quarter on the back of strong safe-haven buying due to geopolitical tensions in Israel. Gold prices hit an all-time high in early December, surpassing $2,100 per ounce for the first time on expectations of U.S. monetary policy easing and a weak U.S. dollar. Prices were also supported by the Israel-Hamas conflict, which boosted the demand for safe-haven assets. Prices of the yellow metal eventually racked up a solid gain of roughly 11% for the December quarter.\r\n\r\nThe impacts of higher gold prices are expected to reflect on Barrick\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter. Our estimate for average realized price of gold is $1,969 per ounce for the quarter, reflecting a sequential rise of 2.1% and a year-over-year increase of 13.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarrick Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Barrick Gold Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nBarrick Gold Corporation price-eps-surprise | Barrick Gold Corporation Quote\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Barrick this season.
