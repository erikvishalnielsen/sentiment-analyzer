        "content": "Mark Cuban And Other Venture Capitalists Pledge Support For Kamala Harris, Who's On The List?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMany venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and beyond believe that Vice President Kamala Harris could be a tech-friendly president. Some, such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, have already endorsed the Vice President, but now a new pledge is attracting more support. The names on it represent some of the most important and well-funded tech funds.\n\nWhile Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban are at the top of the list, the VCsforKamala website shows over 100 venture capitalists signed up, including Chris Sacca, who has been a guest shark on Cuban's show \"Shark Tank.\" The VCsforKamala initiative was created by Seattle venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig. The site defines those on the list as venture capital investors, founders, and tech leaders pledging their support for Harris. They describe themselves as pro-business, pro-American dream, pro-entrepreneurship, and pro-technological progress. So far, the list has over 110 signatories representing approximately $150 billion in venture capital.\r\n\r\nDon't Miss Out: When today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nOne prestigious name on the list is Ron Conway, the head of SV Angel. Conway has been a venture investor since the 1990s. He was also a co-founder of Altos Computer Systems, taking the company public in 1982. SV Angel has invested in Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Asana (NYSE:ASAN), Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and dozens of other private and public companies.\n\nAlso on the list is Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures. He is a longtime entrepreneur and the founding CEO of Sun Microsystems. He formed Khosla Ventures in 2004 and searches for attractive for-profit and social impact companies. Some of the companies that Khosla Ventures invested in and exited include Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), and Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST).\n\nAnother legend in the venture capital world who has signed his name is Brook Byers, a founder at Kleiner Perkins. Byers has been a venture capitalist since 1972, helping to build more than 60 companies. Kleiner Perkins has an alum list that spans some of the most successful companies of all time, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER).\n\nThere are many more investors on the list from large and small venture capital firms based not just in Silicon Valley but in cities all around the country. However, not everyone on the list has committed a large amount of campaign financing.\n\nTrending:Don\u2019t miss out on the next NVIDIA \u2013 invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nNot all venture capitalists are on Harris' side of the aisle. Elon Musk has famously endorsed Trump. His fellow PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) alum Peter Thiel is reportedly on the fence, but Trump's selection of J.D. Vance has made him feel more sanguine about Trump. Other major investors who have declared for Trump include Bill Ackman of Pershing Square and Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital, who donated $300,000 to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe founders of one of the world\u2019s most prominent venture capital funds, Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, have endorsed former President Donald Trump. Andreessen Horowitz has been famously bullish on cryptocurrency and has backed many of Silicon Valley's biggest successes, including Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), as well as Meta, Airbnb, and others.\n\nAs we approach election day, we will likely see more tech luminaries on both sides. Those who favor Harris believe that she will be an ally to large tech companies because of her connections in California. Those who favor Trump believe that he could bring with him a new wave of deregulation that could benefit multiple industries.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "In its upcoming report, Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $0.92 per share, reflecting a decline of 6.1% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $2.75 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 10.7%.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.3% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Airbnb metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross Booking Value' to come in at $21.29 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $19.10 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Nights and Experiences Booked' will reach 126.31 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 115.1 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Gross Booking Value per Night and Experience Booked (ADR)' will likely reach $168.58. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $166.01.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Airbnb here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Airbnb have demonstrated returns of -8.6% over the past month compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb belongs, has lost 3.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAirbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 indicates a change of +15% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Airbnb is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.26 billion and $12.57 billion estimates indicate +13.5% and +11.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $0.41 for the same period compares with $0.18 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.66%. The EPS surprise was +78.26%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Airbnb Inc. plans to offer more luxury amenities next year in a bid to sway more travelers from choosing to stay in hotels.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump\u2019s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Herm\u00e8s Fortune Has Vanished Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Hamas Says Israel Killed Political Leader With Airstrike in Iran\n\nThe company is preparing to expand its business beyond accommodations and experiences to \u201cservices that will make it better for guests to stay in Airbnbs,\u201d Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson said in an interview on the sidelines of the Paris Olympics. Airbnb is considering services such as a personal chef, mid-week cleaning or improving ease of transportation and checking in, Stephenson added.\n\nHe echoed comments from Chief Financial Officer Ellie Mertz who outlined potential additions such as refrigerator stocking and spa services.\n\nStephenson, whose wife received a massage treatment during their stay at their Paris Airbnb, said the company is mulling new offerings with a few questions in mind: Why wouldn\u2019t a traveler stay in an Airbnb, and what makes it easier to stay in a hotel? And, how can the company make its marketplace more seamless for hosts and guests?\n\nHe added that a formal, more detailed announcement about the effort may come \u201cearly next year.\u201d\n\nAirbnb executives have been offering more clues into possible new growth areas. Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky has said the company is ready to expand beyond its core rental offering after spending the past year refining the app to improve reliability, price transparency and removing lower-quality listings.\n\nWatch: Airbnb Makes Paris Affordable, CEO Brian Chesky Says\n\nShares of Airbnb were up about 1% at 10:08 a.m. in New York on Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, the company plans to boost its supply of boutique hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cYou will see us continue to use HotelTonight as an avenue to bring boutique hotels onto Airbnb,\u201d said Stephenson, referencing the company\u2019s 2019 purchase of the hotel deals platform HotelTonight.\n\nBoutique accommodation is a \u201cgreat way for people to travel,\u201d especially for those on business, Stephenson added. \u201cOne or two nights sometimes aren\u2019t always the best for Airbnb stays, which tend to be a longer duration.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s push into boutique hotel rooms has come partly in response to a patchwork of local regulations designed to crack down on home-sharing services like Airbnb. Chesky said in November, for instance, that boutique hotels could \u201csupplement\u201d its New York supply following new occupancy regulations enforced by the city.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Adds share price.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA \u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools The Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Analysts Estimate Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 6, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.92 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.75 billion, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Airbnb?\n\nFor Airbnb, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.24%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Airbnb will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Airbnb would post earnings of $0.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.41, delivering a surprise of +78.26%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAirbnb doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Airbnb Sees Insider Stock Selling",
        "content": "From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Airbnb, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ABNB ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nAirbnb Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent sale by Brian Chesky was the biggest sale of Airbnb shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$140. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nBrian Chesky divested 230.77k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$149. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nAirbnb Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Airbnb. In total, Co-Founder Brian Chesky sold US$34m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Airbnb\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Airbnb insiders own 29% of the company, currently worth about US$26b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Airbnb Tell Us?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Airbnb stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Airbnb is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

        "title": "These 2 Growth Stocks Are Set to Soar This Summer and Beyond",
        "content": "Summer is here, and with it, a new season to invest in wonderful companies that can grow your portfolio through the years. If you have cash to invest in stocks right now, there are plenty of great companies begging to be bought.\n\nThe types of stocks you buy will depend on multiple factors, including your investment preferences, risk tolerance level, and overall financial objectives. Some investors tend to prefer growth-oriented stocks, while others veer toward value or blue chip companies.\n\nOften, the most effective approach is to invest in a variety of companies that represent a variety of industries, and to steadily invest your cash through all market cycles. By doing so, you can ensure your portfolio represents a wide swath of investments that respond to various market triggers in different ways and grow at different rates. This can provide balance as you compound your returns with time.\n\nIf you have cash to invest in stocks as the summer kicks off, here are two companies to consider for your buy basket in the very near future.\n\n1. Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) has been a leader in the pharmaceutical space for nearly 150 years at this point, and its modern era of growth is no less compelling for the long-term investor. Shares are up by close to 50% just in the first half of 2024, as investors have flocked in droves to buy into this company and its success.\n\nOf course, it's always important to look beyond share price to see what the business is actually doing. Eli Lilly is benefiting from the strength of its core portfolio of blockbuster products, as well as newer entrants to the mix that are driving sales and profits skyward. Tirzepatide, the key ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro, is expected to create a windfall of growth for the company over the coming years.\n\nAnalysts think that its tirzepatide franchise alone will bring a combined $34 billion in total revenue to its balance sheet before the end of the decade. Eli Lilly is also studying tirzepatide across other disease areas, including as a potential treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nEli Lilly also just garnered a long-awaited approval for its drug for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, Kisunla. In its pivotal late-stage clinical study, Kisunla reduced cognitive decline for participants by as much as 35% compared to the placebo 18 months out and reduced the risk of progression to the next stage of the disease by up to 39%. Some ballpark figures from analysts peg Kisunla's peak sales potential at $5 billion annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nExisting blockbusters include the likes of cancer drug Verzenio, which is patent-protected until the end of the decade (subject to possible extensions), as well as antidiabetic medications Jardiance and Trulicity. Over the trailing 12 months, Eli Lilly's portfolio has generated about $36 billion in total revenue, with profits coming to around $6.1 billion in that same time frame.\n\nThe company's trailing-12-month operating cash flow totals $3.7 billion, and it had about $2.7 billion in cash sitting on its balance sheet at last count. Eli Lilly's storied commitment to its dividend continues, with a payout ratio of 69% of earnings and habitual dividend increases. Eli Lilly's forward annual dividend yield is less than 1%, often a function of stocks that deliver above-average share price performance.\n\nHowever, the stock has delivered a total return of about 275% over the last three years. With its portfolio of new and established medicines, steady investor returns, and a solid balance sheet, Eli Lilly continues to look like a no-brainer healthcare buy that can keep winning for investors for years to come.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB) has done a remarkable job of innovating its business through economic thick and thin while catering to the ever-changing needs of travelers. As the travel recovery has continued, despite the ongoing worries about the trajectory of consumer spending, Airbnb is one of many travel platforms that has benefited.\n\nHowever, the travel boom is arguably just one of multiple reasons why Airbnb continues to thrive. It operates in a somewhat volatile backdrop in the sense that travel patterns could change if economic conditions and inflation were to worsen notably.\n\nAirbnb's platform is designed to help any traveler find accommodations that fits their needs virtually anywhere in the world. The ability to take advantage of opportunities like pooling funds and staying in a single place with friends for vacation, staying with a local family in a foreign country, or renting an Airbnb for months at a time are just a few examples of the flexibility that is core to the platform and its model.\n\nThe versatility of Airbnb's use cases means that it benefits from different types of spending across a variety of regions, and while vacationers are certainly a big piece of the pie, leisure travel is not the only needle-mover here. Growth in short-term stays is still outpacing long-term stays, but various initiatives to make long-term stays more affordable for users have made a difference.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, long-term stays of 28 days or more totaled 17% of gross nights booked. Meanwhile, nights booked for long-term stays of three months or longer rose 25% in the quarter compared to a year ago. Even though Airbnb has been taking aggressive steps to remove low-quality listings from its platform, active listings still soared 15% year over year in the quarter.\n\nCross-border nights booked on Airbnb rose 10% compared to the first quarter of 2023, totaling about 46% of total gross nights booked. About 80% of its bookings are for group trips, demonstrating that Airbnb is an ideal solution for travelers who don't want the average hotel stay. Most guests book Airbnbs through the mobile app now, with 54% of total nights booked occurring on the mobile app in Q1.\n\nOver the trailing 12 months, Airbnb has generated $10.2 billion in revenue with just shy of $5 billion in net income. With its profit margin of nearly 50%, its asset-light model is clearly another advantage, even if economic conditions worsen, because Airbnb doesn't own or operate the properties listed on its platform.\n\nIt had over $11 billion on its balance sheet at last count, while trailing-12-month free cash flow surpassed $3 billion. Airbnb looks well-positioned to ride out any near-term issues, and the exceptional performance of its business can continue to compound meaningful returns for long-term investors over the next five to 10 years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Overhyped Stocks to Avoid for a Dramatic Fall",
        "content": "Measuring a company\u2019s fair value, especially for overhyped stocks, is more difficult than it seems at first glance. It has to account for future growth, and that growth has to have a valid basis. But even if that is accounted for, it is difficult to price in market irrationality alongside speculation.\n\nBoth price-to-earnings (P/E) and enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) are often affected by the latter. A high P/E ratio is commonly found in high-growth stocks, given that the ratio measures an investor\u2019s willingness to pay above each earnings dollar.\n\nIn contrast, EV/EBITDA ratio considers enterprise value as a company\u2019s market cap plus debt, divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The latter gauges a company\u2019s operating performance without the burdens of debt and regulation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAt a P/E of 49.1, and EV/EBITDA of 32.3, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) owes its market standing and investor confidence to a cluster of moats. Having switched to a software as a service (SaaS) model, Adobe\u2019s Creative Cloud suite powers Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects and others.\n\nAccording to 6sense, these graphics management apps hold a 60% market share, creating a wide network effect moat. Another moat serving Adobe\u2019s favor is the switching cost to alternatives, as it takes time to learn how to use any app effectively.\n\nAdobe began to drain this moat with a policy update that caused a severe backlash, eventually prompting the company to frame it as a misunderstanding. However, this incident, centered around using customer data to train AI models, highlighted the company\u2019s core weakness.\n\nIf Adobe is in a rush to train its AI model, leadership clearly sees that AI apps offer a pathway to low-barrier to entry at a cheaper price point. Apps like PowerDirector, CivitAi, or Ideogram may have lower fine-tuning control, but many smaller platforms are steadily impeding Adobe\u2019s growth.\n\nWhile that doesn\u2019t mean that Adobe will go down any time soon, it paints the company as one of the overhyped stocks heading for a valuation plateau. At $539, ADBE stock is near its 52-week average of $542.97, far from the 52-week high of $638.25 per share.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) A hand holds up the Airbnb (ABNB) logo outside a home in Estonia.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt a forward P/E of 34.1 and EV/EBITDA of 36.5, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) faces potential downturns. The company, part of the \u201csharing economy,\u201d connects short-term lodging providers with guests.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, Airbnb saw an 18% year-over-year revenue growth to $9.9 billion and generated $4.8 billion in net income, up from $1.9 billion in 2022. Despite this, red flags exist. Internal ideological issues could hinder growth, which is problematic for a business model easily replicated by competitors.\n\nMoreover, the housing inventory is growing at the fastest rate since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, per June data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Additionally, U.S. consumer delinquency for FHA single-family loans is at a 16-year high, suggesting potential economic challenges for Airbnb.\n\nThese factors, combined with the ideological issues within the company, paint a bearish picture. Ideological self-sabotage could undermine Airbnb\u2019s stability. The stock is priced at $142, near its 52-week average of $143.35.\n\nYear-to-date, ABNB shares have gained 10% in value, rising 24% above the 52-week low of $113.23 per share. If these negative trends materialize, Airbnb could face significant valuation declines, making it one of the top overhyped stocks going into 2025.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt a P/E of 240.1 and EV/EBITDA of 172.5, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is a unique case of major overconfidence. Specializing in big data analytics, CEO Alex Karp has claimed the company prevented numerous terror attacks in Europe.\n\nFounded by PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) co-founder Peter Thiel, Palantir\u2019s connections include securing a $178 million government contract from the U.S. Army to develop an AI-powered Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node ground station system.\n\nIn Q1 earnings, Palantir reported $105.5 million net income, with U.S. commercial revenue growing 40% and customer count increasing 42% year-over-year. For 2024, Palantir raised revenue guidance to a range of $2.677 billion to $2.689 billion, up from $2.23 billion in 2023, reflecting a 17% year-over-year increase.\n\nDespite these impressive metrics, Palantir\u2019s close ties to the political landscape and reliance on government contracts suggest a limited growth ceiling. The current stock price of $27 is well above the 52-week average of $20.11 and near its 52-week high of $29.83.\n\nNasdaq consensus, based on 15 analysts, puts the stock on \u201chold.\u201d Although Palantir\u2019s government contracts and political connections create a strong moat, they do not justify the high valuation, making it one of the top overhyped stocks to avoid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "They expected an Olympic boon. But some Paris businesses are experiencing a bust",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 On a typical summer day, tourists flock to the historic Marais district of Paris, wandering its charming medieval streets dotted with ultra-chic boutiques, gazing at stunning private mansions, strolling through the elegant 17th-century square Place des Vosges, and filling humming restaurants and bars.\n\nBut this summer has hardly been typical, and those streets, shops and cafes have been markedly emptier in the days leading up to the Paris Olympics \u2014 leaving businesses like Stolly\u2019s Stone Bar, a pub popular with English speakers, pining for summers past.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from what business owners expected when they first heard the Olympics were coming to Paris, says David Carroll, who stood behind the bar on a recent, slow weekday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sure not the Olympics we were hoping for \u2014 so far, anyway,\u201d said Carroll, a Canadian who has been working in the neighborhood for 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for everyone around here.\u201d\n\nCarroll attributes the light crowds to multiple factors, but first and foremost the chilling effect from security measures that have had tourists encountering metal fences, police checkpoints and demands for a special QR code that they may have neglected to obtain \u2014 a digital pass required to access some popular areas before Friday's highly secured opening ceremony along the Seine River.\n\nNow, visitors are facing major disruptions after officials reported fires and other sabotage to the high-speed rail network.\n\nSome would-be tourists decided to avoid Paris altogether during the Olympics, fearing high prices, crowds or general chaos. On top of that, many Parisians have escaped the city in their usual summer exodus \u2014 likely even more so this year.\n\n\u201cMany tourists haven't arrived yet and Parisians have left, so it\u2019s kind of a combination,\u201d Carroll said. And as for the tourists who are here, \u201cpeople aren\u2019t able to move around, so wherever they are, they're kind of stuck in their areas.\"\n\nHe\u2019s hopeful this is \u201cthe calm before the storm\u201d and that after Friday's opening ceremony, things will loosen up. But for now, it can be an ordeal to make even a simple urban trip.\n\nJust ask Gillian Levison and Richard Mitchell. The British couple traveled by train from London this week precisely because, Mitchell said, they figured flying during the Olympics would be \u201ca nightmare.\u201d The rail journey went smoothly until they arrived at the Gare du Nord, the train station in the north of Paris, and found their pre-ordered taxi had been canceled.\n\nThere was a \u201cterrific queue\u201d for taxis at the station, Levison said, and while they felt lucky to find one, the odyssey to their hotel on the Left Bank took two hours and cost 200 euros ($217), exponentially more than it would normally cost.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe irony is that the couple, who live in Dorset, England, have no interest \u201cin those blessed Olympics,\u201d as Levison puts it. \u201cDefinitely not here for that,\u201d she said. Rather, they are attending a family wedding in the countryside and wanted to spend a few days in Paris first.\n\n\u201cIt seems they didn\u2019t think much about how people were going to get across the river,\u201d Mitchell said of Paris authorities.\n\nIt\u2019s all been certainly hurting the business hopes of Jean-Pierre Salson, who owns Factory's Paris, a shop in the Marais specializing in menswear. Salson estimates business is down 30% compared with this time last year and probably 40% among American customers.\n\n\u201cIt's been very slow since the beginning of June,\u201d he said, \"and July is worse. There\u2019s a lot less tourists, from all the countries. I think they're avoiding France and Paris because they're afraid of the Olympics.\"\n\nAnd for those who are in Paris, it's especially hard to get to the center, he added. \u201cThere are restricted areas you can\u2019t get to by car. So you need to walk, and some subway stations are closed.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the high costs of travel to Paris this Olympic season \u2014 and staying there once they arrive \u2014 means some planes are landing with empty seats and hotels are not as booked as they normally would be in the summer high season.\n\nOlivier Ponti, vice president of insights at ForwardKeys, a travel data company with access to airline industry ticketing data, said arrivals to Paris in the three weeks before the Games were down 13% from a year earlier, meaning typical tourists are holding off on trips. But those coming to Paris for the Games have sent arrivals up by 8% during the Olympic period, he said.\n\nSome tourists who would traditionally have been pouring in at this point of the summer \"have been put off by high prices and communication on the number of new obstacles created by the Olympic Games,\u201d such as landmarks being closed or difficulties getting around, he said. \u201cThose traditional travelers have decided that it would be probably great to visit Paris, but not at that time.\u201d\n\nAirlines are feeling the pain. Ponti said that some planes arriving in Paris are not full after many airlines increased capacity for the Games and charged \u201creally high fares.\u201d Air France-KLM said it expects a 150 million to 170 million euro drop in revenue from the Games in the third quarter, while Delta foresees a $100 million hit from June to August.\n\nThose visitors who do get to Paris face high prices at hotels, leading to rooms sitting empty, according to Tim Hentschel, CEO of Hotelplanner, a hotel booking platform. Paris hotels are seeing 70% occupancy compared with 90% at the same time last year, he said this week, noting that the average rate was twice as high as it usually is \u2014 at 700 euros a night.\n\n\u201cThe prices that they were charging for Paris hotel rooms and Paris travel over those Olympic days were just too high for consumers to bear,\u201d Hentschel said, adding that hotels are now starting to drop rates dramatically.\n\nAirbnb, on the other hand, has not seen the same issues. It said in a statement that the Paris Olympics is \u201cone of the biggest hosting events in Airbnb history, with more guests staying in local homes on Airbnb than at any event, ever before.\u201d\n\nSome business owners say they believe \u2014 or simply hope \u2014 that things will get better as the city becomes easier to navigate after Friday's opening ceremony. Though officials say the rail disruptions may last at least through the weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s very quiet now,\u201d Guillaume Faller, who manages the Feria restaurant in the Marais, said this week. \u201cMuch quieter than the same period last year. But I think it will bounce back in a few days. In any case, I hope so. But for now, the (situation) is clearly not what we expected it to be.\u201d\n\nSalson, the clothing shop owner, believes it's just a matter of patience.\n\n\u201dI (just) have to wait,\" he said. \"I\u2019m sure they will be back, because I had many American customers telling me in the spring: \u2018Well, see you in September, October and November!\u2019\"\n\n___\n\nAP writer Courtney Bonnell contributed from Paris.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 57% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Airbnb implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 9 shareholders own 52% of the company Recent sales by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 57% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Airbnb, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Airbnb?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Airbnb does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Airbnb, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Airbnb is not owned by hedge funds. The company's CEO Brian Chesky is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. Nathan Blecharczyk is the second largest shareholder owning 9.8% of common stock, and Joseph Gebbia holds about 7.1% of the company stock. Note that two of the top three shareholders are also Top Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively, once again pointing to significant ownership by company insiders.\n\nWe also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Airbnb\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of Airbnb, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$94b, and insiders have US$27b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Airbnb. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 1 warning sign  with Airbnb , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Even While Insiders Are Selling: July 2024",
        "content": "As general market indexes have soared to new heights in recent weeks, a noticeable trend has emerged: insiders at many high-flying companies are cashing out their shares. This wave of insider selling can often be perceived as a bearish signal, suggesting that those closest to the company foresee a downturn.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to understand that insider selling is not always an indication of trouble ahead. Many times, such transactions are pre-scheduled or part of a routine financial strategy and do not reflect the company\u2019s performance or future prospects.\n\nIn fact, insiders frequently sell shares to diversify their personal portfolios or to realize the value of stock-based compensation. These transactions are typically prearranged and can occur regardless of the company\u2019s performance or outlook. Thus, insider selling isn\u2019t always a bearish signal but rather a standard procedure in the corporate world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this article, I have selected three companies where insiders have been actively selling shares recently. Despite this activity, the following names continue to thrive and present compelling investment opportunities at their current share prices. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on this list is Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), where insider activity during the past three months has seen 30 separate sales amounting to 1,575,285 shares, translating to a notable $233.1 million at the stock\u2019s current price. While this might raise some eyebrows, Airbnb\u2019s investment case remains compelling.\n\nThe company is riding the wave of the travel boom with remarkable success. As the leader in peer-to-peer accommodation and experience bookings, Airbnb continues to grow swiftly despite occasional regulatory hurdles. In Q1 2024, Airbnb registered a 17.8% revenue gain year-over-year, reaching $2.14 billion. This growth follows a strong 20.5% rise in Q1 2023 and a staggering 57.6% in Q1 2022. Clearly, demand for unique stays and local experiences is higher than ever, reinforcing Airbnb\u2019s dominance.\n\nIn the meantime, Airbnb stands out as a free cash flow powerhouse, with notable potential to bolster the equity value in its balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. In Q1, its free cash flow margin soared to an impressive 89%, a level that few, if any, companies can rival on a sustainable basis.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list is Mastercard (NYSE:MA), where insider activity has seen 56 separate sales over the past three months, totaling 5,133,463 shares. At current stock prices, this is equal to a substantial $2.28 billion. While this level of insider selling may seem troubling, Mastercard continues to present an attractive investment case today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company keeps posting robust revenue and earnings-per-share figures, with the two metrics noting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% and 16%, respectively, over the five-year period ending in the first quarter of 2024. The ever-present societal shift from physical cash to digital payments is set to continue unfolding over the coming years, possibly even decades, positioning Mastercard favorably for sustained, double-digit top and bottom-line growth.\n\nWhile the stock might appear pricy at a little over 31X this year\u2019s expected EPS, I believe this is hardly the case. With consensus EPS estimates forecasting EPS growth in the mid-to-high teens in the coming years, I find Mastercard rather attractively valued today. This is especially true when you take into account its overall qualities and moat in the payments processing industry.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC)\n\nSource: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final stock that has seen some heavy insider selling lately and is worth considering is Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC). Insider activity has recorded 45 sales totaling 169,012 shares over the past three months, worth $26.7 million at current prices. While this may seem concerning for some investors, especially given the stock\u2019s awful 56% decline over the past year, the underlying investment case for Paycom remains compelling, in my view.\n\nSpecifically, Paycom continues to record rapid growth, with its cloud-based human capital management software remaining in high demand among mid-sized businesses looking for integrated payroll and HR solutions. This demand is, in turn, powered by a broader trend toward digital transformation in the workplace, where businesses are swiftly adopting all-in-one HR platforms to streamline operations and enhance efficiency.\n\nLast year, Paycom\u2019s revenue and earnings per share soared to new record highs, increasing by 23.2% and 21.5%, respectively. This year, consensus estimates suggest that both metrics are set to achieve new record levels once again. Meanwhile, despite its strong results, the stock\u2019s extended sell-off has driven Paycom\u2019s current valuation to just 20.4X this year\u2019s expected EPS\u2014a multiple that doesn\u2019t seem to reflect its underlying performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis held a long position in ABNB.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos To Sell Another $5 Billion In Amazon Shares: How Could He Spend It?",
        "content": "Jeff Bezos To Sell Another $5 Billion In Amazon Shares: How Could He Spend It?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhenever the billionaire founder of a company sells off some shares, eyebrows are raised. What could it mean? Is it a sign of trouble? SEC filings recently revealed that Jeff Bezos, the former CEO and current executive chair on the board of directors at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), plans to sell 25 million shares worth approximately $5 billion. Investors may wonder if that\u2019s a bad sign, and Bezos watchers may be curious about where the money might go next.\n\nCheck it out: Bezos' favorite real estate platform launches a way to cash in on the private credit boom \u2014 get started for just $100.\n\nThe good news for investors is that Bezos isn\u2019t jumping out of Amazon. These 25 million shares represent just a tiny part of his stake in the company, which is around one billion shares. That works out to around $220 billion. Bezos might just be taking advantage of an opportunity. Amazon stock was down in 2023 and has spent much of the spring and summer on a steady upward climb, hitting a 52-week high recently. Why not celebrate by taking a little off the top? And with another successful Prime Day event under Amazon\u2019s belt, it seems like a good time to sell a little with the confidence that the rest will keep going up. Where might Jeff Bezos put $5 billion to good use?\n\nLet's Get Spending\n\nBezos may have earned his billions through Amazon, but he\u2019s not shy about spending them elsewhere. Aside from yachts, travel, and luxury goods, there are two main areas where we have seen Bezos devote a lot of money: real estate and investing.\n\nHe could always buy more real estate. He has spent $237 million on three properties on Indian Creek Island, the elite Florida area known as the Billionaire Bunker. Bezos and his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, have decided to make the Miami area their home base. For a billionaire, no property is perfect. Like his neighbor Tom Brady, Bezos plans to make major renovations, tearing down two of the mansions he owns on the island and living in the third while he plans what is likely to be another incredible home.\n\nHe still owns his custom-built home on Lake Washington in Seattle and several other properties in the Washington area. And he enjoys the other Washington as well. When he bought the Washington Post, he picked up two homes in the Kalorama neighborhood, including a former textile museum, which he is completely remodeling. His New York City holdings include multiple prime Fifth Avenue building floors. No tech billionaire is caught without a Hawaii hideaway, and Bezos has one of those, too, a pristine estate in Maui. What's missing? A pied-\u00e0-terre in Paris, perhaps? A ski home in Jackson Hole, WY? The possibilities, like Bezos's wallet, are nearly endless.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe could and probably will invest again. Bezos doesn't just bet on himself and Amazon. He has made dozens of investments through his Bezos Expeditions investment firm, including the Washington Post and his space exploration company, Blue Origin. One of the reasons Bezos stepped down from his CEO role at Amazon was to spend more time at Blue Origin. That move paid off and accelerated the company's growth even as Bezos battled with space rival Elon Musk. Blue Origin recently filed a complaint to curb the number of rockets that SpaceX can launch from Cape Canaveral.\n\nBezos doesn't have to own a company to invest in it. Bezos Expeditions has strategically invested in now-public companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER).

If you need the money or spot a more compelling investment, this isn't a bad time to sell Amazon, especially if you have held it for a while and are ready to put those gains elsewhere. However, you should remember that, like Bezos, you may be subject to some capital gains taxes.\n\nAn argument could also be made that this isn't a great time to sell Amazon because it may continue to go up from here. With a thriving e-commerce empire, the power of the AWS cloud business, and Amazon's forays into generative AI, it could be argued that Amazon is just getting started. Analysts agree. According to Benzinga data, Amazon is a buy with a consensus price target of $216.7 based on the ratings of 40 analysts. Recently, Wolfe Research initiated coverage with an Outperform rating.\n\nWhile Amazon's next earnings results on August 1 won't give us insights into how well the latest Prime Day event did, it will provide key updates on the growth of the cloud and e-commerce businesses and other segments, including media and advertising. In Amazon's shareholder letter earlier this year, CEO Andy Jassy laid out the opportunities for Amazon, noting that even as Amazon has created a $500 billion consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. He also sees a massive advantage in cloud migration, growing media and advertising, and generative AI, which he said \u201cmay be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\u201d No stock is a sure thing, but those are some reasons that Amazon may be a hold for more than just Jeff Bezos.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAirbnb's estimated fair value is US$272 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Airbnb is estimated to be 45% undervalued based on current share price of US$148 The US$153 analyst price target for ABNB is 44% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nHow far off is Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$4.71b US$5.87b US$6.87b US$8.02b US$8.87b US$9.59b US$10.2b US$10.7b US$11.2b US$11.6b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 10.62% Est @ 8.15% Est @ 6.42% Est @ 5.21% Est @ 4.36% Est @ 3.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4%  US$4.4k US$5.1k US$5.5k US$6.0k US$6.2k US$6.2k US$6.2k US$6.1k US$5.9k US$5.7k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$57b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$12b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.4%) = US$236b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$236b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$115b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$172b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$148, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Airbnb as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.098. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Airbnb\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for ABNB.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +0.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Content industry, which Airbnb falls in, has lost 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAirbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.8%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.35 indicates a change of +15.1% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Airbnb is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ABNB _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.25 billion and $12.56 billion estimates indicate +13.4% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $0.41 for the same period compares with $0.18 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.66%. The EPS surprise was +78.26%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's Why We Think Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) Is Well Worth Watching",
        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nHow Fast Is Airbnb Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nOver the last three years, Airbnb has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Outstandingly, Airbnb's EPS shot from US$3.19 to US$7.78, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 144% year-on-year growth like that.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. On the one hand, Airbnb's EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Airbnb's future profits.\n\nAre Airbnb Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$93b company like Airbnb. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$27b. This totals to 29% of shares in the company. Enough to lead management's decision making process down a path that brings the most benefit to shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Airbnb, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.\n\nAirbnb's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$295k in the year prior to December 2023. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.\n\nShould You Add Airbnb To Your Watchlist?\n\nAirbnb's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. Airbnb is certainly doing some things right and is well worth investigating. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted  1 warning sign for Airbnb you should be aware of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "TechTarget TTGT shares ended the last trading session 5.7% higher at $34.75. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 5.9% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nTechTarget\u2019s stock appreciated on continued optimism surrounding the demand for its solutions and services. The company is strengthening its services by teaming up with other companies. Earlier this year, it collaborated with G2 to introduce G2 Techblend. The new solution combines G2\u2019s software market peer reviews and TTGT\u2019s expert editorial to provide contextually relevant content experiences for researchers and users.\n\nThis operator of websites for information technology vendors is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.6%. Revenues are expected to be $57.96 million, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor TechTarget, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on TTGT going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The pent-up demand for travel, both leisure and business, is driving a wave of optimism for investors.\n\nTravel stocks, which were severely battered during the height of the pandemic, are now showing promising signs of recovery and growth.

The shift towards remote work has also enabled people to embrace a world that is becoming increasingly more digital.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on experiences over material possessions is contributing to a surge in travel spending. This is evident in the millennial and Gen Z segments, and credit card companies are taking advantage of this new phenomenon. As inflation cools and confidence fuels, the travel industry is poised to outperform in 2024 and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the three best no-brainer travel stocks to buy that can deliver 100% returns or more by 2028!\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Woman holds the key with the logo of a popular company Airbnb over the landscape of Genova, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has changed the way people travel and experience new destinations across the globe. Since its inception, it has grown exponentially, offering a diverse range of accommodations that cater to various preferences and budgets. But the true kicker is its incredible financial performance amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment in the last 24 months.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s innovative business model has disrupted the traditional hotel industry. Its strategy, which connects hosts with guests, has created a thriving marketplace for short-term rentals. While this is its bread and butter, the company proved just how agile its business is during the pandemic. It quickly adapted by promoting longer term accommodations, catering to both business and leisure travelers. This has allowed the company\u2019s active listings and bookings to continue to grow.\n\nIn FY23, revenue increased 18% year over year to a record $9.92 billion. Additionally, net earnings skyrocketed 153% year over year to $4.79 billion with active listings of more than 7.7 million. As revenue and earnings accelerate in Q1, Airbnb is set to be a major beneficiary of the travel demand resurgence in 2024.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), the parent company of well-known travel websites like Booking.com, Priceline and Kayak, is among the best no-brainer travel stocks to buy in July. The company\u2019s vast portfolio of online services makes it a dominant player in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nA major strength of Booking Holdings is its extensive global network and strong market position. The company operates in more than 220 countries, which includes 29 million accommodation listings. Additionally, in the 2023 fiscal year, the company\u2019s platform crossed a record 1 billion rooms booked. Its growth through acquisitions strategy has significantly enhanced its user experience and operations. Furthermore, its new AI trip planner aims to drive further operational efficiencies and customer satisfaction.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $4.42 billion. Net earnings swelled 192% from last year to $776 million, or $22.37 per share. It continues to see positive trends at Booking.com, with higher frequency and more travelers moving into the upper Genius loyalty tiers. This makes BKNG stock well-positioned to double or more by 2028.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Group (RCL) Royal Caribbean (RCL) ship Allure of the Seas, docked.\n\nSource: Laszlo Halasi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoyal Caribbean Group (NYSE:RCL), one of the world\u2019s largest cruise operators, is another travel stock with immense growth potential. Its fleet expansion and introduction of new, state-of-the-art ships are expected to drive growth in the years ahead.\n\nRoyal Caribbean has a reputation of delivering exceptional onboard experiences, with a focus on entertainment, dining and activities. The cruise industry has rebounded strongly from the pandemic with demand for cruises reaching record levels. It remains well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with a robust pipeline of new ships set to debut. This includes a sister ship to the Icon, called Star of the Seas, that is due to enter service in 2025.\n\nRoyal Caribbean\u2019s targeted marketing campaigns, pricing strategies, and onboarding experiences also continue to drive momentum forward in 2024. In the first quarter, revenue increased 29% year over year to $3.73 billion. Net earnings ballooned 850% year over year to $360 million compared to a loss of $48 million for the same period prior. With management raising its full-year EPS guidance for FY24, RCL stock is among the best travel stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Airbnb (ABNB) Gains 7.8% YTD: How to Play the Stock Now?",
        "content": "Airbnb ABNB has seen its stock price climb 7.8% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry and S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 11.7% and 18.2%, respectively.\r\n\r\nGreater volatility in travel demands due to macroeconomic uncertainties, foreign exchange headwinds and the impacts of geopolitical conflicts have been major concerns for the company.\r\n\r\nAlthough Airbnb's brand is highly recognized around the world, rising competitive pressure from the two juggernauts of the online travel booking industry \u2014 Booking Holdings BKNG and Expedia EXPE \u2014 does not bode well for its market position. Listing and meta search websites like TripAdvisor TRIP and Trivago are also strong rivals of ABNB.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNevertheless, the modest gain in the stock reflects Airbnb\u2019s resiliency despite the above-mentioned challenges. The company\u2019s strong core business, strategic investments and expanding global footprint, which are driving growth in its Gross Booking Value (GBV), are major positives. Solid momentum in its marketplace, which connects hosts and guests online, and strong listings on its platform are helping it grow in urban and non-urban areas. It is worth mentioning that Airbnb has more than 7.7 million listings on its platform across 100,000 cities in almost every country and region across the globe.\n\nIn first-quarter 2024, GBV amounted to $22.9 billion, which rose 12% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. Growing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum across non-urban areas and increased demand for urban and cross-border travel, contributed well. Nights and Experiences Booked were 132.6 million, up 9.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nStrategic Investments Aid Long-Term Prospects\n\nAirbnb\u2019s continuous investments in its key strengths bode well for its long-term prospects.\r\n\r\nStrong investments to grow the size and quality of the host community remain noteworthy. The company is expanding use cases, and supporting various kinds of hosts (the ones who share their homes with guests) to attract more hosts globally to its platform. The move will help hosts to deliver high-quality stays and experiences for guests. Airbnb is also raising awareness around hosting in order to make it easier for hosts to get started.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, the company removed several listings that failed to meet guests' expectations. Excluding these listings, active listings, excluding experiences, grew 17% year over year, with double-digit supply growth across all regions.\r\n\r\nAirbnb\u2019s growing investments to strengthen its core services are positives. It has added more than 430 features and upgrades to its core service to make its platform more reliable and affordable for guests. The launch of Guest Favorites, a collection of the most-loved homes on Airbnb based on ratings, reviews and reliability data, is driving the company\u2019s momentum among various guests. It has witnessed more than 100 million nights booked at Guest Favorites listings since the launch.\r\n\r\nThe recent launch of a label feature, which ranks the top listed properties with a badge, is a plus. The feature allows customers to choose from a wide range of properties.\r\n\r\nAirbnb is deepening its focus on international expansion. It is investing in under-penetrated or less mature international markets to unlock growth opportunities. The company has witnessed strong results from this strategy. In first-quarter 2024, growth in gross nights booked in these markets was more than double the core markets.\r\n\r\nIt intends to expand its global network and partner with communities to help more hosts join its platform.\r\n\r\nAirbnb introduced a category of extraordinary experiences called \"Icons,\" hosted by celebrated personalities in music, film, TV and sports. This is helping common people to understand the experience that ABNB offers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid Liquidity Supports Shareholder-Friendly Initiative\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and short-term investments amounted to $11.1 billion compared with its long-term debt of $1.99 billion. The company also generated net cash of $1.92 billion from operating activities and a free cash flow of $1.91 billion in first-quarter 2024.\u00a0\r\n\r\nA stable balance sheet and strong liquidity position will not only help the company pursue strategic acquisitions but will also enable it to repurchase shares. The company repurchased $750 million of its shares in the same quarter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2024, Airbnb announced a share repurchase authorization to purchase up to $6 billion of its Class A common stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nAirbnb\u2019s strong investments to deliver enhanced experience to both host and guest communities are expected to drive growth in its GBV and contribute well to its top-line growth in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 GBV is pegged at $81.99 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.8%. The consensus mark for 2024 Nights and Experiences Booked stands at 493.34 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 10.1%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $11.25 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.4%.\r\n\r\nHowever, macroeconomic headwinds, seasonal impacts and rising competition are making investors bearish about the stock. This is evident from the downward revision in earnings estimates.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.65 per share, which has moved 0.2% south over the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, Airbnb is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 29.21X compared with the industry\u2019s 24.32X, reflecting a stretched valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHence, investors should wait for a better entry point for Airbnb, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Prediction: 4 Sub-$100 Billion Hypergrowth Stocks That Can Join Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft as Trillion-Dollar Companies by 2040",
        "content": "Since Wall Street's major stock indexes bottomed out in October 2022, the floodgates have been wide open for optimists. The mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite have all rocketed to record-closing highs this year.\n\nHowever, the \"Magnificent Seven\" deserve most of the credit for lifting Wall Street to new heights. All seven members of the Magnificent Seven, which includes artificial intelligence (AI) behemoth Nvidia, tech juggernaut Apple, and software colossus Microsoft currently sport, or once obtained, a trillion-dollar market cap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nProfessional and everyday investors are captivated with finding the next company, or set of companies, that can join this exclusive trillion-dollar club.\n\nWhile nothing is set in stone, four high-growth companies, with perceived-to-be sustained competitive advantages and current market valuations of less than $100 billion, have the necessary tools and intangibles to become trillion-dollar businesses by 2040 and join the likes of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nPalantir Technologies (current market cap of $62 billion)\n\nThis first hypergrowth stock that has a reasonable pathway to become a trillion-dollar company over the next 16 years is AI-inspired data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nWhat makes Palantir so special is that its services can't be duplicated by any other business at scale. The company's AI-driven Gotham platform handles data collection and mission-planning, among other tasks, for federal governments. Palantir typically lands four- or five-year government contracts that produce predictable sales and cash flow.\n\nBut there's also a tangible ceiling to be expected with Gotham. Since Palantir's management team won't allow certain entities to access its Gotham platform (e.g., China), there's only so much of a growth runway for this time-tested operating segment.\n\nThe lion's share of Palantir's future growth is liable to come from its Foundry platform. This is its enterprise-facing service designed to help businesses better understand their data so they can streamline their operations. As of March 31, the company had 427 commercial customers worldwide, which was up 53% from the prior-year period. In other words, Foundry is still in its very early stages of expansion.\n\nIf Palantir can attract larger businesses to use Foundry, there's a real chance it can sustain a 20% (or greater) sales growth rate.\n\nAirbnb (current market cap of $93 billion)\n\nA second fast-paced company with a sub-$100 billion market cap that has a realistic shot at attaining a $1 trillion valuation by 2040 is stay-and-hosting platform Airbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe travel industry has been ripe for disruption for decades, and Airbnb looks to have a variety of solutions. Its stay-and-hosting marketplace is directly taking on the traditional hotel industry. After handling roughly 140 million bookings in 2018, Airbnb is pacing more than 500 million nights and experiences booked in 2024, based on the 132.6 million recorded in the first quarter.\n\nWhat's incredible to think about is that Airbnb's marketplace only features \"more than 5 million hosts.\" With somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 billion homes worldwide, there's room for massive expansion in the number of platform hosts in the coming years.\n\nHowever, Airbnb is about far more than just hotel disruption. Travel is an estimated $11.1 trillion industry (as of 2024), and Airbnb can easily edge its way into other tourism channels to gain a sizable piece of the pie. In addition to its Experiences segment, which works with local experts to lead travelers on adventures, Airbnb can, for example, partner with airlines, restaurants, and theme parks to hang onto a greater percentage of what travelers spend.\n\nKeeping travelers within its ecosystem of products and services is the game-changer that could make Airbnb the travel industry's most-valuable company. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSea Limited (current market cap of $42 billion)\n\nThe third supercharged growth stock that has the necessary catalysts to become a trillion-dollar company by the start of the 2040s is Singapore-based conglomerate Sea Limited(NYSE: SE).\n\nThe \"recipe\" that could lift Sea from a reasonable $42 billion valuation to a cool $1 trillion in 16 years involves all three of its operating segments firing on all cylinders.\n\nFor the moment, its digital entertainment division (known as \"Garena\") is responsible for the lion's share of its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Free Fire remains one of the world's most-popular mobile games, with 8.2% of Garena's nearly 595 million quarterly active users paying to play its mobile games during the first quarter. This is a considerably higher pay-to-play rate than the industry average.\n\nThe second segment that can drive significant growth is SeaMoney, the company's digital financial services operations. Many of the Southeast Asian countries Sea offers its services in are chronically underbanked. Providing basic financial services in emerging markets can be SeaMoney's ticket to rapid sales and profit growth.\n\nBut the game-changer of all segments is likely to be e-commerce platform Shopee. A burgeoning middle class in Southeastern Asia and Brazil has welcomed Shopee with open arms. After $10.3 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) traversed its site in 2018, Sea's e-commerce site is pacing $94.4 billion in GMV in 2024, based on its first-quarter results.\n\nPayPal Holdings (current market cap of $63 billion)\n\nA fourth hypergrowth stock that can, by 2040, stand side-by-side with the likes of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft as trillion-dollar businesses, is financial technology (\"fintech\") leader PayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL).\n\nAlthough PayPal is contending with increasing competition in the digital payment space, a majority of its most-important key performance indicators are moving in the right direction. For instance, total payment volume (TPV) grew by 14% on a constant-currency basis (i.e., excluding currency movements) to almost $404 billion in the March-ended quarter. No matter what's been thrown PayPal's way, payment transactions and TPV have consistently grown by a double-digit percentage.\n\nWhat's even more important for PayPal's future is that active accounts are becoming more engaged. At the end of 2020, the average active user had completed 40.9 payments over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. But as of the end of March 2024, this had risen to 60 payments over the TTM for active accounts. If engagement among active accounts continues to improve, PayPal's gross profit should keep rising.\n\nDon't overlook the role relatively new CEO Alex Chriss can play, either. Chriss was formerly the head of Intuit's Small Business segment, so he knows a thing or two about innovation, cost control, and what small merchants want. Chriss has tightened his company's belt in some areas, all while unveiling a new advertising platform that should benefit from long-winded economic expansions.\n\nWe're still in the very early innings of digital payment adoption and expansion, which bodes well for PayPal's future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "holiday not spots\n\nCouncils have been accused of \u201ctapping up taxpayers\u201d with a raid on second homes, despite out-of-towners taking up just a fraction of properties.\n\nSince April, local authorities have been allowed to charge a 100pc council tax premium on unoccupied homes after just one year, instead of two.\n\nCouncils have rushed to implement the surcharge on second homeowners, who have been accused of pricing out locals and turning communities in popular coastal and rural areas into \u201cpermanent\u201d Airbnb settings.\n\nBut in close to two thirds (63.7pc) of the 146 councils that have so far confirmed they are implementing the double tax, fewer than one in a hundred properties are second homes, according to analysis of official data by The Telegraph.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn no local authority that has so far brought in the higher council tax charges do second homes make up more than 8.6pc of dwellings.\n\nSome councils who have introduced the changes have fewer than 100 second homes registered in the local authority, while just 11 of the councils that have implemented the tax raid are currently raising more than \u00a310m from taxing second homeowners. Half are making less than \u00a31m.\n\nThis is despite concerns first raised in The Telegraph that the enhanced powers are catching out homeowners never intended as targets for the tax, including home movers and low income households.\n\nElliot Keck, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said the premium\u2019s \u201cpitiful revenues do not come close to justifying its existence\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor too long town halls have focused on fiddling with different ways to dip into the wallets of their residents, rather than focusing on delivering quality services.\n\n\u201cLocal authorities should prioritise cutting down on waste and finding efficiencies to ensure they aren\u2019t continuously tapping up taxpayers.\u201d\n\nGravesham Borough Council raised \u00a343,013 last year from taxing second homeowners, according to government figures. Only 23 properties in the borough are classed as second homes \u2013 or 0.05pc of the local housing stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome \u00a355,000 in tax was clawed back from second homeowners in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, where second homes also account for one in 2,000 properties.\n\nThe double council tax applies to properties that are left empty for more than a year. It is part of a wider bid to deter out-of-towners buying up homes and pricing out locals, while increasing funding for local services.\n\nFormer housing secretary Michael Gove previously said second home ownership was turning seaside towns and other parts of the country into \u201cpermanent\u201d Airbnb settings.\n\nThough it is up to councils whether or not they implement the council tax premium, it comes as local authorities are under severe financial strain. Some, including Britain\u2019s largest local authority Birmingham City Council, have been forced into effective bankruptcy, with local politicians warning finances are\u00a0being pushed to the brink.\n\nCritics have said grey areas in the new rules means councils are not required to refund \u201caccidental second homeowners\u201d who claim to have been hit with a tax charge after being unable to sell during a move.\n\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, maintained the council tax premium would help free up houses for locals to buy or rent.\n\nA spokesman said: \u201cThere is a desperate need for more affordable housing across the country and councils need all options possible to ensure a supply of homes for rent and sale that meets local needs.\n\n\u201cCharging a council tax premium, for long-term empty and second homes, is one way of encouraging owners to bring these properties back into permanent use.\n\n\u201cHowever, we remain clear that council tax itself has never been the solution to meeting the long-term pressures facing local services, and councils need the powers and resources to build more affordable homes.\u201d",

        "content": "Uncovering stocks with the potency to thrive and dominate by 2030 is a base for sustainable portfolio growth. Here, the focus is on three standout companies\u2019 strategic and financial edge that may lead the next decade. The first one leverages its pioneering role in haptic technology, fortified by strategic alliances with industry giants. These partnerships secure a stable top line and validate its technological leadership in an increasingly digital world.\n\nMoreover, the second company emerges as a formidable force with its robust growth in client acquisitions across commercial and government sectors. The company\u2019s strategic focus on operational efficiency and client loyalty through expanded deployments points to its resilience and market adaptability. Finally, the third one is a disruptor in the hospitality industry. It continues to innovate with initiatives. These efforts enhance guest satisfaction and drive significant revenue growth by tapping into diverse market segments globally.\n\nOverall, the core strategies and financial strengths driving these companies illuminate their potential and pivotal roles in shaping market dynamics and generating substantial returns by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) leads in haptic technology. Financially, Immersion solidified its liquidity with $179.1 million in Q1 2024, marking an $18.7 million increase from the end of 2023. This liquidity enhancement supports ongoing operations and provides flexibility for strategic investments in research and potential expansion. The company\u2019s fundamental ability to grow its cash while rapidly expanding the\u00a0top line\u00a0reflects its solid financial standing. The company has a fundamental capacity for sustained growth in the tech industry, where CapEx leads vital strategic shifts.\n\nStrategically, Immersion has fortified its market lead through\u00a0renewed licensing agreements. These include recent contracts with gaming and consumer electronics leaders such as Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) and SamsungElectronics. These agreements point to the value of Immersion\u2019s intellectual property in haptic technologies. Indeed, they secure recurring top-line and validate their technology lead. By leveraging its patents and partnerships, Immersion ensures revenue stability and positions itself for continued advancement and market penetration.\u00a0This\u00a0is a critical edge as haptic technology gains traction across various consumer and industrial applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Immersion\u2019s lead in haptics, strategic partnerships, and a strong patent portfolio solidifies its presence on the list of stocks to dominate by 2030.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) leads in data integration, analytics, and operational intelligence. The company\u2019s client acquisition strategy has been solid.\u00a0This\u00a0is particularly true in the US commercial segment. In Q1 2024, the company added 41 net new clients, representing a 69% annual increase in client count. This growth is supported by the massive adoption of AI platforms (AIP) across industries. These industries include vital sectors like utilities, energy, and airlines. In Q1 2024, the company\u2019s government revenue grew by 16% annually. This\u00a0is driven\u00a0by the continued adoption of its platforms in defense and public sector initiatives.\n\nNotably, Palantir was awarded a significant $178 million contract from the US Army under the TITAN program.\u00a0This points to its role as a critical technology provider in national defense and security efforts. There were adversities in\u00a0Europe in Q1, against which Palantir continues to pursue growth in international markets (like in Asia and the Middle East). The company\u2019s international government revenue boosted by 33% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 2024.\n\nTo sum up, Palantir\u2019s sharp growth in securing high-value government contracts and commercial client base solidifies its presence on the list of stocks to dominate by 2030.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates an online marketplace for lodging. In Q1 2024, active listings for accommodations grew by 17% YOY. This growth excludes listings removed for failing guest expectations. This growth indicates sharp management of listing quality while scaling supply to meet booming demand. The sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions highlights Airbnb\u2019s ability to attract and retain hosts. Indeed, the introduction of Guest Favorites has been successful, with over 100 million nights booked at these high-rated homes since launch. Airbnb is investing in less mature markets and introducing new categories like icons\u00a0with\u00a0extraordinary experiences. As a result, these expansions aim to unlock new top-line and attract diverse client segments.\n\nFurther, growth in gross nights booked in expansion markets outpaced growth in core markets. Airbnb\u2019s mobile app downloads increased by 60% YOY in the US, contributing to a 21% YOY increase in global nights booked via the app. The shift towards mobile bookings reflects Airbnb\u2019s sharp mobile strategy and user engagement efforts, accounting for\u00a054% of total bookings.\n\nTo conclude, Airbnb\u2019s expanding global footprint and diversification into unique experiences position it as a disruptor on the stocks to dominate by 2030 list.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in PLTR.

        "content": "Tourism to Maui has decreased significantly after the islands was hit by wildfires. Vrbo last month changed its cancellation policies. State Farm / Flickr\n\nVrbo last month reversed a longstanding policy on guest refunds and host cancellations, tipping the benefits toward guests and away from hosts when there are major travel disruptions.\n\nUnder the new rules, when Vrbo activates its Extenuating Circumstances Policy during a disruption, hosts must refund guests regardless of their own cancellation policies. Vrbo refunds the traveler service fee the guest paid when booking the stay.\n\n\u201cThe financial impact of this policy will be felt entirely by hosts,\u201d said Rena Pacheco-Theard, co-founder and CEO of luxury vacation rental platform Boutiq, which uses Vrbo as one of its sales channels.\n\nPacheco-Theard noted Vrbo doesn\u2019t take the financial risk, including paying for mortgages, landscaping and utilities. \u201cRather than travelers being responsible for purchasing trip insurance to protect against natural disasters and abnormal weather events or declared health emergencies, hosts now foot the bill with no compensation,\u201d she added.\n\nAn About-Face for Vrbo\n\nVrbo\u2019s new Extenuating Circumstances Policy looks a lot like the Major Disruptive Events Policy that Airbnb introduced in May. It is an about-face from Vrbo\u2019s prior cancellation policy: Even during the pandemic, it declined to mandate refunds to guests. At that time, Vrbo urged hosts to refund guests, but it left it up to hosts\u2019 discretion and their individual cancellation policies remained in effect.\n\nThat won it much support from hosts. Airbnb, on the other hand, earned hosts\u2019 ire when it required them to refund guests regardless of their own cancellation policies.\n\nHosts have the ability to establish their own cancellation policies, and they often vary as to which dates a guest would be eligible for a full or partial refund, and the cutoff date when no refund is possible.\n\nVrbo intends to activate the policy and mandate that hosts refund guests during natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, flooding, tornadoes and wildfires, and other abnormal weather events.\n\nThe policy would not apply to hurricanes in the Caribbean during hurricane season, for example, unless it would trigger a prolonged power outage impacting \u201ca vast majority of homes in a major region or city,\u201d Vrbo\u2019s policy states.\n\nThe policy will cover new government-declared pandemics, but not Covid-19 because it is considered a risk that people should already be aware of.\n\nWhen a government imposes mandatory travel restrictions \u201cthat make it impossible or illegal for a guest to travel\u201d or a host to proceed with the stay, the extenuating circumstances policy would be in force.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Did Vrbo Change Its Policy?\n\nA hint of Vrbo\u2019s change of thinking came during the Maui wildfires last summer when Vrbo mandated guest refunds. But Vrbo didn\u2019t implement an overall change in policy at that time.\n\nA Vrbo spokesperson told Skift Friday that its policy change last month was \u201cinformed by our response to the Maui wildfires,\u201d and \u201ca shift in industry norms to improve protection for travelers during major weather events.\u201d\n\nVrbo has been clamping down on hosts, including banning them from the platform, when they have a pattern of cancelling reservations for reasons that are out of bounds in Vrbo\u2019s view. However, the Vrbo spokesperson said that host cancellations under the new policy will not be subject to penalties or a denigration of their status, such as being a premier host.\n\n\u201cWe continually evaluate our policies and our primary objective with this policy is to prioritize the safety and well-being of all parties involved,\u201d the Vrbo spokesperson said. \u201cWe strongly encourage hosts to collaborate with guests to the fullest extent possible in these situations, demonstrating their commitment to guest satisfaction and safety.\u201d\n\nThe Varied Impact to Vrbo Versus Hosts\n\nPacheco-Theard of Boutiq contrasted the potential financial impact of the policy change to hosts versus Vrbo.\n\n\u201cTravelers who have already planned on a trip and time away from commitments will likely just switch to a new location and book with Vrbo again in a town that isn\u2019t impacted,\u201d Pacheco-Theard said. \u201cThus, the effect on Vrbo for allowing full cancellations is neutral and potentially even positive for its own revenue.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, hosts have to pay credit card processing fees, which can typically be 3.9%, and they don\u2019t recoup that money on a refunded stay, she said. These fees would amount to around $195 on a cancelled booking of $5,000.\n\n\u201cWhen a host is required to issue a full refund, like with this new policy, a host\u2019s earnings will not just go to $0 on a booking, they will actually lose money on a reservation,\u201d Pacheco-Theard said.\n\nOn the other hand, some would argue, guests should be able to recoup their money when it is illegal or impossible to reach the booked rental because of a landslide or tornado.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Returns On Capital Are Showing Encouraging Signs At Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)",
        "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Airbnb:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.16 = US$1.6b \u00f7 (US$25b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Airbnb has an ROCE of 16%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Hospitality industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Airbnb  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Airbnb's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Airbnb  for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Airbnb Tell Us?\n\nAirbnb has recently broken into profitability so their prior investments seem to be paying off. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 16% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 255% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.\n\nOn a side note, Airbnb's current liabilities are still rather high at 58% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.\n\nOur Take On Airbnb's ROCE\n\nLong story short, we're delighted to see that Airbnb's reinvestment activities have paid off and the company is now profitable. Considering the stock has delivered 6.2% to its stockholders over the last three years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike most companies, Airbnb does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nWhile Airbnb isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Summer travel is in full swing and the pent-up travel demand has\u00a0given a boost to\u00a0travel stocks. About 7.7 million people traveled by air on the Memorial Day weekend while a whopping 71 million people were expected to travel on the Fourth of July weekend. These two are the busiest weekends for travel companies before Christmas.\n\nAirlines and cruise lines are set to carry millions of people this summer. The travel sector is hot and if you want to make the most of the soaring travel spending, invest in these travel stocks ready to take home significant gains. These stocks are trading at a discount and have the potential to move higher when they report results. With the earnings season starting this week, it is time to rebalance your portfolio with high-growth stocks. Let\u2019s take a look at them here.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Image of an airplane branded with the Delta Airlines (DAL) logo. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: Lerner Vadim / Shutterstock.com\n\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is one of the top companies to benefit from the summer travel season. A record 3 million fliers passed through the TSA checkpoints on July 7, setting a new one-day record.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDelta\u2019s extensive domestic and international routes put it in a strong position to benefit from the same. It accounts for over 60% of the domestic market share. However, all airlines are not in that position. While some will be able to dodge the doldrums of high fuel prices and increasing operating costs, many won\u2019t.\n\nThe company has recently announced the second-quarter results with a revenue of $15.4 billion, a 5.4% YOY jump and the EPS at $2.36, a significant improvement from the EPS of 45 cents in the first quarter. It\u00a0is aiming\u00a0for an EPS of $6 to $7 and a free cash flow between $3 billion to $4 billion for the full year.\n\nFor Delta Air Lines, there is a rise in premium travelers and this can help boost the profit. The quarter saw a 10% improvement in premium travel revenue which is why the company is also investing in fancy airport lounges. Its premium revenue comprises 56% of the total revenue. The company has also announced a 50% dividend hike.\n\nTrading at $44, DAL stock is up nearly 10% year-to-date and is a strong buy below $50. Its third-quarter results will be equally impressive and a higher cash flow will lead to lower debt, putting the company in\u00a0a very strong\u00a0position in the coming quarters.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) meone holds the Airbnb logo in front of Dresden, Germany landscape. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a top-quality business available at a cheap price right now. Trading at $146, the stock is up almost 10% YTD and much lower than the 52-week high of $170. The company has seen several ups and downs recently which has led to a pullback in the stock. However, I believe the holiday season could benefit it significantly.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter, its EPS came in at 41 cents and the quarterly profit jumped 126% YOY. This was also its best first quarter ever with a revenue of $2.14 billion and gross bookings up 12% YOY.\n\nAirbnb has already seen a 400% jump in bookings in Paris for the Summer Olympic Games and will benefit from the summer travel and Christmas holidays in the coming quarters. Now is an ideal time to buy one of the top travel stocks at a discount.\n\nAirbnb is\u00a0a very strong\u00a0brand with a solid network that supports its growth. The company makes money by charging fees to the guests and hosts which ensures a steady and stable revenue stream. It has 5 million hosts and more hosts will attract more guests. Since hosting on Airbnb has become a way to make passive income, listing a property on Airbnb has become a no-brainer decision.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother airline stock to buy, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) has an extensive network of domestic and international routes. The company reported a net loss of $124 million in the first quarter and saw a 9.7% YOY jump in operating revenue to $12.5 billion. It saw a 10% rise in passenger revenue.\n\nExchanging hands for $45, the stock is up over 11% YTD and is trying to recover from the impact of the pandemic.\u00a0It is\u00a0slowly but steadily reducing losses, expanding revenue and seeing higher passenger traffic. The company has been around for long and has bounced back from several challenges.\n\nUnited Airlines has suffered recently due to the multiple setbacks faced due to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and the key metrics to watch in the coming quarters are revenue growth and operating expense management. Its future developments with Boeing will also\u00a0have an impact on\u00a0the business and the company\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nThe management has a clear strategy for growth with efficient cost management and an improvement in free cash flow. While the management\u2019s second-quarter guidance was below expectations, I believe it will be able to beat market expectations with the massive travel demand.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Airbnb Mortgages\n\nNatWest has launched an \u201cAirbnb mortgage\u201d\u00a0to help borrowers who are struggling to pay their loans.\n\nUnder new mortgage terms, new and existing customers at the bank will no longer need to apply and pay for a \u201cConsent to Let\u201d, as long as they only let a room in their home for up to 90 days of the year and do it through an \u201capproved platform\u201d like Airbnb.\n\nThe high street bank said by updating its policy, more families facing higher mortgage rates can \u201ctake up the benefits of home sharing\u201d.\n\nThe new terms will also make it easier for customers to let out their homes to holiday goers if, for example, their main residence becomes vacant during an extended family holiday, or if they have a gap between tenancies on a rental property,\u00a0the bank said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPreviously, homeowners could not let out their properties on a flexible basis without specific permission.\n\nNatWest joins other major lenders already offering similar terms,\u00a0including Halifax, Barclays and Metro Bank. Similar restrictions \u2013 90 days or four months\u2019 of letting \u2013 usually come with a loan-to-value cap of 75pc.\n\nMajor mortgage lenders have increasingly been offering loans with longer terms to help borrowers spread out and reduce monthly repayments.\n\nLast year, HSBC launched a new mortgage with a 40-year term. Newer entrants to the mortgage sector are also trying to pioneer longer fixes, bringing Dutch-style mortgages to the UK. Longer fixes would make British borrowers less vulnerable to interest rate shocks.\n\nDutch lender April currently offers borrowers fixed-rate mortgages of five to 15 years. Homeowners can then switch to a lower loan-to-value band and pay a reduced rate of interest as their loan decreases. Normally, homeowners can only do this when they remortgage.\n\nCompanies have also noted an uptick in homeowners taking lodgers. Property share site SpareRoom said that there has been a 89pc increase in households taking in a lodger between January 2021 and January 2024 \u2013 and credits the spike to biting mortgage costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere, Barclays announced a series of cuts to its mortgage rates today effective from Friday.\n\nThe biggest reduction will be 33 percentage points on the bank\u2019s five-year fix available to borrowers with at least a 25pc deposit, falling from 4.57pc to 4.24pc.\n\nThe latest fall in rates follows a string of repricing downwards by lenders in anticipation of a Bank Rate cut, and following a difficult time for business in the lead up to the general election.",

        "title": "How this Airbnb exec is applying business strategy lessons to his HR role",
        "content": "Good morning!\n\nAs CHROs rise to prominence and reinvent themselves, many companies have started thinking about making their HR function more aligned with the company\u2019s business goals. But Airbnb has taken it a step further and tasked the executive leading global business strategy with also overseeing its people function.\n\nIn 2015, Airbnb renamed its chief human resources officer title to \u201cchief employee experience officer.\u201d And in 2021, Dave Stephenson, then-chief financial officer, took on the additional employee experience role. Early this year, Stephenson ditched his CFO title and became Airbnb\u2019s first chief business officer, while still carrying on with his employee experience role.\n\nStephenson\u2019s dual responsibilities are emblematic of the company\u2019s efforts to become more \u201cfunctional,\u201d and break down different siloes between different divisions. Although they may seem different on paper, Stephenson says his two roles have more in common than meets the eye.\n\nStephenson recently sat down with Fortune to discuss his job, and how HR can be a better partner to the broader business.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nFortune: You were previously chief financial officer. Why take on the new gig of chief business officer, and remain head of employee experience?\n\nDave Stephenson: In the chief financial officer role, you have the fiduciary duties of the overall company, but you're also making sure the company is executing against key goals and key measures, financial and otherwise. This extension to take on a similar role or even a deeper way to drive the business, was a great fit. I've been in this head of employee experience role for nearly two years now, and there was a nice overlap there as well. The CFO role is thinking about: Where do you invest? Where do you invest people? Where do you invest dollars? And EX [employee experience] is similar: How do you invest in the capabilities you have in the company? Now, I'm pulling it even further into driving the business.\n\nDo you think your business background benefits how you approach employee experience?\n\nI think a business background helps. If you don't have it, spending time to be embedded more within the business will add a lot. That is really key. There are times that HR functions can get wrapped up around their particular functional area, versus the business being the primary focus. How do these elements support the business need, and support in getting the most out of our people? All of HR should be about getting the best out of our people, in whatever way that is, rather than supporting just an administrative task.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbnb has renamed the CHRO position \u201chead of employee experience.\u201d Why the new name, and why take this responsibility out of HR?\n\nThere's a reason we also don't call it HR, it's not human resources. Employee experience is the idea that we are ensuring that we're investing in people to deliver amazing results for our guests and our hosts. We think that our people are our strategic asset that enables us to deliver better results. That's what we're investing in. We don't make a physical thing. We're not making a car, we\u2019re not making a phone, we're not making a computer. We provide a service. It's people that we invest in to go deliver that service. Human resources can be at times, in some places, a support function instead of an enablement function. I am desirous to make sure that it is truly an enabler for driving the business, not just a catch-all for some administrative tasks. It\u2019s much more than that.\n\nOther companies seem to be interested in turning their traditional HR function more into a strategic business partner. Is there any advice you have for organizations that want to make the same leap that Airbnb did?\n\nThe best piece of advice I can give is that [for] the employee experience, or the HR function, be really intentional about what they can enable to drive the business forward. And be very pragmatic and focused on what that support looks like, rather than trying to be administrative.\n\nA recent example for us is on the administrative side, we started looking at all the different training that people do. We had 14 hours of various required training elements for various teams around the company. We did an audit of it and streamlined and worked on what is actually critical for them to do their job. We streamlined that down into just a few hours of what we think is critical training for somebody onboarding. So rather than a new hire coming on, [and saying] \u201cHere's your 14 hours of random trainings,\u201d now it's, \u201cHere are the two, three hours of very specific training activities that we know you need to do.\u201d And then give them tools for less specific training that not everyone needs, but they need for their particular job. It's a more pragmatic, more directed way to deliver results.\n\nAirbnb introduced a \u201clive and work anywhere\u201d policy two years ago. What have you learned since launching that?\n\nIf we're going to have a fairly lean team relative [to] the size of our business, we need world-class talent for every one of those roles. Not all of that talent is within 50 miles of downtown San Francisco. They are all around the world. We need to open up the aperture to bring in the best talent from wherever they are, and enable them to do their best work. If they want to sign on to Airbnb, they're going to need to be willing to do some traveling because there\u2019s going to be key moments that we do need to work together and collaborate together in person. What we've done is designed the calendar so that we have these moments. But then we also enable them to have the flexibility to live elsewhere. That's worked incredibly well. It has enabled us to recruit some of the best talent in the world, and it's helped us with our retention of existing employees. We've done things like our live and work anywhere allowance, we provide $2,000 a year to support people in any other needs that they might have in order to support that flexibility and work.\n\nPaige McGlauflin\r\npaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com\r\n@paidion\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

In fact, 71 million Americans are hitting the road, taking to the skies and traversing waterways, according to data from the American Automobile Association (AAA). Travel is now well above pre-pandemic levels. For Independence Day this year, 5.7 million more Americans are traveling more than they did in 2019 before Covid-19, said AAA.\n\nAlso, air travel was on track to set a new record over Independence Day, with 5.74 million people flying to their holiday destination. Many more Americans embarked on road trips, with 60 million people expected to travel by car over the holiday, up 5% from 2023. At the same time, cruise lines report record numbers of passengers and claim their ships are booked well into next year. All the activity makes now the perfect time to own stocks of travel companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s soar with three best travel stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nViking Holdings (VIK) MV Viking Star in North Sea Canal. Detail of funnel. VIK stock and VIK IPO\n\nSource: StudioPortoSabbia / Shutterstock.com\n\nSwiss cruise operator Viking Holdings (NYSE:VIK) went public in the U.S. in May of this year. Already, its stock is up 30%. The strong performance makes Viking Holdings one of the most successful initial public offerings (IPO) of the year. Analysts expect VIK stock\u2019s stellar performance to continue given the company\u2019s profitability, wealthy clientele and long-term growth potential.\n\nFounded in 1997 and headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Viking Holdings today generates $3 billion in annual revenues and employs more than 10,000 people. The company primarily runs cruise ships along European rivers and caters to older travelers. It does not allow people under 18 on its ships. More about the company will be known when it issues its next financial results in late August. But this new travel stock certainly looks promising.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) remains a top travel stock, especially with summer holidays in full-swing. The homestay and short-term rental company\u2019s share price has gained 14% so far this year as it recovers from the ravages of the pandemic and grows both its sales and profits.\n\nFor this year\u2019s first quarter, Airbnb posted EPS of 41 cents, which was well ahead of a consensus estimate of 24 cents. The quarterly profit was up 126% from a year ago and the company\u2019s best first quarter ever.\n\nRevenue in Q1 totaled $2.14 billion, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.06 billion. Sales were up 18% from a year earlier. Gross bookings in the quarter were up 12% year-over-year (YOY), while nights and experiences booked rose 10%. Airbnb\u2019s free cash flow at the end of the quarter totaled $1.90 billion, up 21% from the same period in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy all accounts, it was a blowout quarter and showed the company is benefitting from the resumption of travel, both in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a dip buying opportunity. Shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), the world\u2019s largest carrier, are down nearly 40% over the last 12 months and trading near a 52-week low. This presents an opportunity for investors, particularly ones with a long time horizon. AAL stock is down after the airline lowered its sales and profit guidance as it grapples with a slump in business travel.\n\nAlso, American Airlines recently announced that its Chief Commercial Officer (CEO) Vasu Raja was leaving the company at the end of June. News of the lowered guidance and executive departure has sent AAL stock spiraling lower. The problem is a decline of corporate customers and business travel, something American Airlines has struggled to reignite since the end of the pandemic.\n\nThe good news is that management has a plan. CEO Robert Isom has said that American Airlines plans to modify its ticket distribution strategy to drive bookings to its own platforms instead of third-party channels. That strategy could help the company and its stock recover. Investors who take a position in AAL stock now might be patting themselves on the back down the road.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

They don\u2019t have to show taxes on first view.\n\nHowever, Expedia.com is displaying the total cost upfront in bold, including fees and taxes, for hotels.\n\nSource: Expedia.com\n\nAirbnb, Booking.com and Vrbo do not show the total rate and fees upfront, including taxes.\n\nAsked why Expedia.com shows the total cost for hotels but not for Vrbo\u2019s short-term rentals, an Expedia Group spokesperson said: \u201cRegarding Vrbo, we are following an approach consistent across the industry, which allows travelers to make fair price comparisons when shopping across competing platforms.\u201d\n\nAirbnb\u2019s \u2018Total\u2019 Price\n\nAs shown in the accompanying image, Airbnb shows guests in California the nightly rate plus all fees, excluding taxes.\n\nCalifornians View a Variation of Total Price On All Listings Outside of California\n\nBoth Expedia and Airbnb are applying their policies for California-based travelers even if they aren\u2019t in California.\n\nThis highlights how the California junk fee law impacts how Californians can now view more transparent pricing for Expedia, Booking.com, and Airbnb listings throughout the world \u2014 and not just for properties within California\u2019s borders.\n\nNon-Californians who want to book an Airbnb in another state or other countries that don\u2019t mandate total price displays can use Airbnb\u2019s toggle feature to view the nightly rate plus all fees, excluding taxes, or merely the nightly rate.\n\nVrbo\u2019s Approach for Californians Is Similar to Airbnb\u2019s\n\nLike Airbnb, Vrbo shows California-based shoppers \u2014 whether they are trying to book inside California or outside \u2014 the nightly rate including fees, but excluding taxes. It\u2019s in bold and upfront when they view listings. The total rate, minus taxes, is in a lighter font. You can see it in the following screenshot.\n\nThe way Vrbo displays upfront listings outside of California, when viewed by people outside the state, is subtly different. In this case, as seen below, Vrbo bolds the nightly rate, but it doesn\u2019t include fees. And the nightly rate plus fees \u2014 but excluding taxes \u2014 is there in a smaller light font, as seen below for a Miami listing.\n\nThe Booking.com Irony\n\nIn California and for California-based shoppers elsewhere, for both hotels and short-term rentals, Booking.com displays upfront the nightly rate, including fees, but excluding taxes.\n\nStory continues\n\nVrbo provides a better explanation than Airbnb and Booking.com, letting travelers know in each listing that the rate in bold includes fees.\n\nFor hotels and short-term rentals outside of California when viewed by travelers based elsewhere, Booking.com displays up-front nightly rates in bold for both hotels and short-term rentals, and in a light font states \u201c+$20 taxes and fees,\u201d for example.\n\nOne can make the argument \u2014 ironically \u2014 that Booking.com is in one respect more transparent upfront about the total price for hotels and short-term rentals outside of California for people based outside of the state than it is for California-based shoppers.\n\nGranted, though, Booking.com delivers that transparency in a light font that some travelers might not notice.\n\nThat\u2019s because in California, Booking.com highlights in bold the nightly rate, including fees but excluding taxes. However, anywhere other than California, for people based out of state, while Booking.com merely bolds the nightly rate, excluding fees and taxes, it explains within the listing in a light font how much the additional taxes and fees will be.\n\nAirbnb and Vrbo both have pop-up messages explaining to Californians or people outside the state looking to stay in the Golden State, what their new pricing shows.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The travel season has begun in full swing. Nothing can stop Americans from boarding their next flight and sipping their Pina coladas by the beach. An estimated\u00a071 million Americans will be traveling this weekend to celebrate the Fourth of July.\n\nThis means investors\u00a0need to\u00a0start looking for stocks that could rake in sizzling summer profits. Many travel companies are looking hot right now with stocks ready to rally. Investing in them now could mean solid gains when results are reported. So, let\u2019s explore three travel industry gems worth buying for a hot and spicy summer.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Inside the airplane cabin of a Delta flight.\n\nSource: EQRoy / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe largest airline in the world, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)\u00a0sees impressive growth during the holiday period. Considering the Memorial Day weekend and the upcoming peak travel weekend, Delta Air Lines will report impressive quarterly revenue growth. Inflation could not stop Americans from traveling and many are heading to countries where the dollar fares well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe ongoing recovery of the travel sector will help the airlines due to its extensive domestic and international routes. Also, Delta Air Lines has seen a growth in premium traffic, which means a higher margin. Management is optimistic about the growth prospects and expects a 5% to 7% jump in international travel bookings.\n\nNotably, its fundamentals set the momentum for the remaining year with a 6% year-over-year (YOY) jump in operating revenue in the first quarter. The company quickly moved from a loss-making airline in 2023 to a profit-making airline in the first quarter of the year. Up 16% year-to-date (YTD), DAL stock is trading for $46.71 at the time of writing and remains one of the best stocks to buy below $50.\n\nAlso, the stock pays a dividend and has a yield of 1.28%. Based on the current trend, Delta Air Lines holds a solid position to benefit from summer travel.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) Woman standing in hotel room with luggage looking at the view. Hotel stocks.\n\nSource: Boyloso / Shutterstock\n\nLeading hotel chain MarriottInternational (NASDAQ:MAR)\u00a0has remained a solid industry player, despite rising competition. Many travelers still prefer a hotel over a rental unit and this is the reason that Marriott International benefits. A top choice in the industry, its financials are proof that the company has a lot more to come.\n\nThe comparable sales jumped 4.2% YOY, and the net income\u00a0came in at\u00a0$564 million in the first quarter. While the net income has declined YOY, the company\u2019s global expansion plans could help boost the numbers. It managed to report an 11% YOY growth in the worldwide market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, the company signed\u00a0a record number of\u00a0franchise agreements representing 164,000 rooms globally. Loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy is a strong driver of consumer growth and business. It has over 185 million members globally and ensures repeat business.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s rich history and global presence reinforces revenue growth. Up 7% YTD and 30% in the past 12 months, the stock is exchanging hands for $239.98. The company has aggressive\u00a0expansion plans across Europe and will add 100 properties and 12,000 rooms by the end of 2026. Europe is a global tourist destination and with the heavy crowds, the demand for hotel rooms\u00a0is going to\u00a0rise. Thus, Marriott International is planning to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt is hard to talk about holidays and not mention Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). One of the biggest beneficiaries of the summer travel season, Airbnb gives solid competition to hotel chains like Marriott International.\n\nUp 12% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $154 and looks undervalued. It was sitting at $212 in 2021 and has lost a lot of value since then. The company will see a solid jump in booking and revenue in the current quarter due to the ongoing holiday period. For the\u00a0first quarter, it reported an EPS of 41 cents while the profit jumped 126% YOY. This was the company\u2019s best first quarter ever with revenue at $2.14 billion.\n\nIn addition, the Summer Olympics Games has already led to a 400% jump in Airbnb bookings in Paris. A pent-up demand will continue to drive growth and as the economy improves, we could see Airbnb move higher. It usually has a slow first quarter followed by excellent quarters due to the holidays.\n\nThe supply of new housing in the U.S. market could\u00a0be a threat to\u00a0the business but I do not think it will have a long-term impact on Airbnb. To improve user experience, the company has removed several low-quality listings and is working on expanding services. Ignore the temporary tailwinds and buy ABNB stock for long-term gains.\n\nAirbnb is a high-quality business available at a discount right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A woman from China has been arrested at a Vermont lake bordering Quebec for trying to smuggle 29 eastern box turtles, a protected species, into Canada by kayak, according to Border Patrol agents.\n\nWan Yee Ng was arrested on the morning of June 28 at an Airbnb in Canaan as she was about to get into an inflatable kayak with a duffle bag on Lake Wallace, according to an agent's affidavit filed in federal court. Agents had been notified by Royal Canadian Mounted Police that two other people, including a man who was believed to be her husband, had started to paddle an inflatable watercraft from the Canadian side of the lake toward the United States, according to an agent's affidavit.\n\nThe agents searched her heavy duffle bag and found 29 live eastern box turtles individually wrapped in socks, the affidavit states. Eastern box turtles are known to be sold on the Chinese black market for $1,000 each, according to the affidavit.\n\nNg is charged with attempting to export the turtles from the U.S., in violation of the Endangered Species Act. A federal judge on Friday ordered that she remain detained. The federal public defender's office, which is representing her, declined to comment.\n\nBorder Patrol agents first spotted Ng at the Airbnb rental in May when they noticed a vehicle with Ontario plates traveling on a Vermont road in Canaan in an area used by smugglers, they said. Lake Wallace has been used for human and narcotic smuggling, the affidavit states. The vehicle had entered the U.S. in Alburgh, Vermont, agents said.\n\nNg was admitted to the United States in May on a visitor visa with an intended destination of Fort Lee, New Jersey, the affidavit states. Border Patrol agents learned on June 18 that she had again entered the U.S. in Buffalo in a vehicle with a Quebec plate and was expected to arrive at the same Airbnb on Lake Wallace in Vermont on June 25, the affidavit states. They then started to surveil the property.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit new all-time highs and many individual stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,\u00a0several\u00a0others are marching fiercely upwards. Identifying a real winner in the stock market isn\u2019t easy but some stocks have stood the test of time and stood strong amidst market volatility. Some of the best long-term S&P 500 stocks to buy are solid, dividend-paying companies that have a strong presence in the industry and have reported impressive financials.\n\nThese stocks are worth buying and holding now. As the economy improves, these seven stocks could soar higher. If you\u00a0are looking\u00a0to rebalance your investment portfolio for the second half of 2024, here are the long-term S&P 500 stocks to buy and hold.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustry darling and top tech stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the potential to drive the market higher or bring it down. The company is on a roll and its artificial intelligence (AI) prowess has taken the revenue to unimaginable highs. NVDA stock has become affordable for investors after the recent stock split and this is a chance to buy and hold the tech giant.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is exchanging hands for $123 and is up 8% in the past month. It will continue to rule the market with its exceptional AI chips and GPUs. The soaring demand for chips will drive revenue higher for the company.\u00a0When Nvidia rises, it takes the market along with it.\n\nIt saw a 262% year-over-year jump in the\u00a0first-quarter revenue and\u00a0it\u00a0will continue beating expectations in the upcoming results. The management aims to report a revenue $28 billion in the current quarter. Buy NVDA stock in every dip, it isn\u2019t done yet.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best fintech companies, Visa (NYSE:V) holds a strong market share with over 4 billion cards in circulation. The stock is exchanging hands for $266 right now and has lost most of\u00a0the gains it made\u00a0since the start of the year.\n\nAny dip in Visa stock is a chance to buy. It is a steady business with low operating costs and a global presence. Visa charges a fee on every transaction made using its card. As we move towards digital payments, this fee\u00a0is only going to increase. While the stock might seem expensive right now, its valuation is justified.\n\nThe company has reported strong revenue growth and as the economy improves, consumer spending will rise, benefitting Visa. There aren\u2019t many businesses as profitable as Visa and it enjoys a powerful network effect with its 130 million merchant locations. Despite competition, Visa has managed to grow. It also pays a dividend and has a yield of 0.78%\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown for offering consumer goods at low prices, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) operates a chain of hypermarkets and it is steadily expanding across the U.S. With a large number of locations, it has become easier for people\u00a0to quickly reach a Walmart and pick consumer goods.\n\nWMT stock is up 27% YTD and is exchanging hands for $67. The company sets itself apart with affordability. Walmart\u2019s financials were solid with a 6% jump in revenue for the recent quarter and a 21% jump in the e-commerce segment. The company did not accept defeat when people started online shopping, instead, it\u00a0started\u00a0to invest money in the e-commerce business which is now thriving. Walmart also makes revenue from ads which saw a 24% YOY jump.\n\nThe 3-for-1 stock split earlier this year has made Walmart affordable and buying it below $100 is\u00a0a very smart\u00a0move. Walmart is a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 1.22% and it recently hiked the dividend by 9%. This dividend is its 51st consecutive hike.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been talking about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for a while now. The growing demand for cloud and the rising popularity of AI have led to a massive growth in Oracle\u2019s business. It already has a rich history and a strong presence in the software database industry.\n\nAs companies migrate to the cloud, Oracle\u2019s business is steadily growing. Up 34% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $140 and is very close to the 52-week high. The company recently stated that a TikTok ban could impact its business but I think this impact will be short-lived.\n\nOracle has established itself as a strong industry player and has partnerships with some of the biggest tech giants. It is also expanding into the healthcare industry which can boost long-term growth. Oracle\u2019s total\u00a0outstanding performance obligations in the recent quarter stood at $98 billion, showing its strength in the competitive market.\n\nIt has a dividend yield of 1.14% and\u00a0has a lot of\u00a0room to run.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is set to benefit from the soaring oil prices. Crude oil is trading at over $80 per barrel today and this means this company is going to report impressive quarterly numbers. It had some of its best days in 2022 and I think it could see a similar time this year. CVX stock is exchanging hands for $156 and is up 4% YTD. It has been trading in the range of $141 to $169 in the last 12 months.\n\nBillionaires are betting big on this stock and even if you are someone who believes that renewables will take over the world, it will take time. Until then, we will need oil and\u00a0the demand for it\u00a0is only growing.\n\nChevron is Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite play and the\u00a0merger with Hess (NYSE:HES)\u00a0is going to\u00a0make it a giant energy powerhouse. It will give Chevron access to the Guyana assets which can help increase production. Its dividend yield of 4.17% makes it even more attractive.\n\nDelta Airlines (DAL) Delta airlines aircraft interior full of passengers. Why are so many flights overbooked?\n\nSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe upcoming summer travel season could be huge for Delta Air Lines. Americans are planning to travel a lot this year with an expected\u00a071 million people traveling for the Fourth of July. This is where Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)\u00a0is set to benefit. The company has an extensive domestic and international route and the management is highly optimistic about the summer travel season.\n\nDAL stock is already up 20% YTD and is exchanging hands for $48. While it is near the 52-week high, there is potential for further upside. The company is expecting earnings\u00a0in the range\u00a0of $6 and $7 per share which could drive the stock higher to $55.\n\nIt has managed to reduce debt while seeing an improvement in operating income. In the first quarter, it reported a 6% YOY jump in operating revenue and swung into profit from a loss in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nI believe\u00a0Delta Air Lines is set for a second-half surge and its quarterly results could be impressive.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) meone holds the Airbnb logo in front of Dresden, Germany landscape. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock\n\nTrading at $151, and up 12% YTD, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is receiving a boost from the summer travel season. Its first-quarter earnings came in hot and the management signalled for a slower growth in the second quarter, which led to a drop in the stock. However, if you look at the long-term picture, the business\u00a0looks\u00a0strong and it enjoys several competitive advantages.\n\nThe first quarter revenue soared 18% YOY to $2.14 billion and the EPS doubled to $0.41. The strong numbers were driven by the Easter holiday and an interest income. In the other three quarters, Airbnb is set to benefit from the Memorial Day weekend, summer travel, and Christmas.\n\nThis could be an excellent time to load up on the stock. The management is aiming for a revenue growth\u00a0in the range\u00a0of 8% to 10% for the second quarter and while it is lower than the growth reported in the first quarter, it could be a temporary slowdown. The third quarter could also see a revenue boost from the Euro Cup and Summer Olympics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alix Bateman hopes to maintain links with Porthcawl after selling her childhood holiday getaway - Jay Williams\n\nOne of Alix Bateman\u2019s earliest and most enduring memories is of mislaying her beloved pink hippo toy on the rocks at Porthcawl.\n\nShe was, perhaps, four years old.\n\nShe also remembers playing on the sand with her brother, rock pooling, visiting the funfair, and going on donkey rides \u2013 all the hallmarks of a classic old-school seaside summer holiday, staying with her grandmother Ella.\n\n\u201cWe used to go down and visit every summer, at least once a year,\u201d says Ms Bateman.\n\n\u201cIt was a very big part of my childhood, and our family history there goes back until the 1850s.\u201d\n\nFamily visits to the flat, which Ella had bought in 1985, continued long after her death.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2020, Ms Bateman and her brother inherited the property from their parents, and planned to continue visiting with their own children as well as renting it out on Airbnb to cover running costs.\n\nBut a growing realisation that neither of them had much time to spend in Wales, plus the practicalities of paying for and administering the property, has forced them into a painful decision. Ms Bateman hoped to continue visiting the flat with her children, as well as renting it out on Airbnb - Jay Williams\n\nThe flat went on the market in June with Chris Abraham Property at \u00a3150,000.\n\n\u201cI do feel sad about it,\u201d says Ms Bateman, 57, who lives in Clapham, south-west London, with her 18-year-old son and their two Bedlington terriers.\n\n\u201cAbout a year after we inherited it, my brother and I realised that we had only really visited it once or twice ourselves. Our kids are no longer at bucket and spade age, and there were a lot of bills and a lot of admin involved in renting it.\u201d\n\nSecond homeowners, even those with long-term links to a location, have had a tough time of late.\n\nIn the Budget, Jeremy Hunt sounded the death knell on the furnished holiday lettings tax regime.\n\nThis scheme currently allows some 127,000 owners of homes that are let out fully furnished to deduct mortgage income payments from their rental income, a privilege which other landlords lost in 2020.\n\nFrom April 2025, this tax loophole will be closed, along with lower capital gains tax on furnished rental homes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe idea is to encourage landlords to sell up which, in theory, will bring more stock onto the market for local people.\n\nLocal councils, meanwhile, are using powers introduced in 2023 to deter second-home buyers by doubling their council tax bills. Ms Bateman fondly remembers seaside holidays at her grandmother's flat in Porthcawl\n\nTelegraph analysis recently revealed that by next year, more than three quarters of second home owners will face council tax surcharges, while simultaneously paying more for household bills and maintenance.\n\nThe tax burden is high, and growing \u2013 in April, Bridgend County Borough Council, which includes Porthcawl, announced a 200pc surcharge for second home owners.\n\nThe surcharge will rise to 300pc after two years \u2013 one of the highest levels in Wales.\n\nThe problem with Ms Bateman\u2019s property is most certainly not lack of demand from holidaymakers. The flat rents out at about \u00a3120 per night.\n\nWinter trade was slow but it was solidly booked over the Easter, spring half-term, and summer holidays by a mixture of young families and surfers.\n\nIn September, during Porthcawl\u2019s annual Elvis festival, fans of The King flying in from around the world would snap it up.\n\n\u201cI also wanted less admin in my life, fewer emails to answer,\u201d says Ms Bateman who runs The Glebe House London, an events venue.\n\nWhen the flat does sell, she plans to use her share of the proceeds to help her university-bound son with fees and costs. She also realises that selling the property doesn\u2019t have to mean cutting ties with her past.\n\n\u201cI do want to keep links with Porthcawl when the flat is sold.\n\n\u201cI know I will be back, I just won\u2019t be in that particular property,\u201d she says.\n\nDifficulties making second homes stack up is not solely a UK problem\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the European Union has also put the squeeze on owners of overseas properties, like Aled Evans. Aled Evans decided to sell his Spanish flat to a French couple for \u20ac70,000 (\u00a359,000) in May last year - Mark Pinder\n\nIn 2018, he spent \u20ac66,000 (\u00a355,670) on a two-bedroom apartment in the Condado de Alhama golf resort in Murcia, Spain.\n\nThe plan was to use the flat as a family getaway for him and his two daughters, now aged 11 and 14, and to rent it out in between to cover its running costs.\n\nAt first everything worked well.\n\nThe family, who live in Bedlington, Northumberland, could jump on a flight from Newcastle Airport, and would visit three or four times a year to relax by the pool and enjoy a round of golf.\n\nRenting the flat out on Airbnb earned \u201cabout \u00a35,000 or \u00a36,000\u201d per year \u2013 enough to cover bills and maintenance \u2013 and it seemed like a win-win situation.\n\n\u201cI thought it might be a good investment too because they were building new flats at the resort,\u201d says Mr Evans, 49 who runs his own travel company, My Local Tour.\n\nThen the Brexit deal was completed and things changed overnight.\n\n\u201cMy Spanish taxes went up \u2013 as a non-EU resident I had to pay 24pc tax to the Spanish government,\u201d says Mr Evans.\n\n\u201cFor me to get the income I needed meant becoming completely uncompetitive compared to the other owners, who are mostly European and were not paying such high tax.\n\n\u201cIt was pointless to keep it on the site, because nobody was interested. It just became untenable.\u201d\n\nLast year, Mr Evans decided to sell the flat. It sold for \u20ac70,000 to a French couple in May.\n\n\u201cAfter I had paid all the fees I just about broke even,\u201d he says.\n\nThe girls have taken the sale of their holiday home with equanimity.\n\n\u201cThey were a bit sad about it but it means we will be able to try out lots of different places, instead of always going to Spain.\u201d",

        "title": "The great Spanish Airbnb crackdown",
        "content": "Barcelona is introducing a blanket ban on Airbnbs in a desperate bid to stop rents spiralling and lure more young people back into the city - Emilio Morenatti\n\nThe writing has long been on the wall for Airbnb investors in Spain. Now, they are feeling the backlash. In the space of a fortnight, the cities of Palma, Malaga, Valencia and Barcelona have clamped down on short-term rentals (STRs), announcing strict restrictions.\n\nThe Spanish government has even said it is looking into a countrywide ban on tourist apartment rentals in residential buildings.\n\nThese harsh measures come against a backdrop of rising rents, booming visitor numbers and fierce protests against mass tourism.\n\nThere are now more than 400,000 STR properties in Spain, according to the industry analyst AirDNA. But that is lower than its 2019 peak of 419,946, says Bram Gallagher of the firm.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUnlike France, where listings have continued to explode, the restrictions in Spanish cities \u2013 as also seen in Portugal \u2013 has had an impact: the regulations make it harder [for property buyers] to justify the investment.\u201d\n\nDespite that, the number of international buyers in Spain in the first quarter of 2024 remains close to record levels, according to the latest government figures. CaixaBank research found that the average price gap between housing in tourist towns and other areas has widened to more than 75pc, a record level, in late 2023.\n\nSuch investors face \u2013 and have also helped fuel \u2013 rising prices in Spanish cities. The cities with the highest concentrations of STRs \u2013 including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia \u2013 have all recorded rising property prices in the year to date, according to Idealista, a real estate firm; in Malaga, prices have shot up by 19.6pc in the last year.\n\nThere has been a spate of anti-tourism protests across Spain that have been targeting unsustainable levels of mass tourism in cities and Airbnb lets driving up local housing prices. This activism seems to have spurred city councils into making these announcements, although tourism levels are not solely to blame.\n\nRent controls backfiring\n\nBarcelona, the biggest recipient of international tourists in Spain, has been leading the Airbnb crackdown.\n\nStory continues\n\nA licensing system was introduced for Airbnbs in Barcelona back in 2011. By 2018, there were 18,000 listings, according to AirDNA, when stricter enforcement of illegally-listed STRs began, alongside a moratorium on new licences in central areas (Ciutat Vella, Eixample, Gracia, and Poble-Sec).\n\nIn 2021, it became the first European city to ban private room rentals of 31 days or less, and the number of listings nose-dived.\n\nLast week, Mayor Jaume Collboni announced that he will completely get rid of tourist apartments in the city by 2029. He said he would do this by not issuing new licences and not renewing existing ones.\n\nThe government hopes this will bring over 10,000 short-term lets back onto the residential market, easing rental prices in the Catalan capital, which have risen by 68pc over the last decade, according to council data.\n\nYet restricting supply has driven up occupancy levels to record highs \u2013 an average of 75pc in the past two years \u2013 according to AirDNA, which has further encouraged investors (and many illegal rentals too).\n\nMark Stucklin, of Barcelona-based analyst Spanish Property Insight, says: \u201cAccording to the town hall only 10,101 properties have rental licences. The practice of long-term rental tenants dividing up their apartments into tiny rooms for STR sub-lets is regularly reported in the local press. It is very lucrative, and landlords cannot evict them as they pay the rent.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish government has also recently brought in new rental controls designed to \u00a0protect vulnerable tenants. But these have backfired in cities across Spain, persuading many long-term let landlords to pivot to short or medium-term rentals, making the shortage of properties to rent even more acute.\n\n\u201cThe new rent controls make it practically impossible to evict a tenant for non-payment and removes the landlord\u2019s ability to negotiate rates, conditions and contracts,\u201d says Stucklin.\n\nProperties in Barcelona with a STR licence have been selling for a 10-15pc premium, according to agent Lucas Fox, but with the potential ban looming \u2013 if the legislation gets passed \u2013 this premium has surely been diminished.\n\nMohammad Butt, of Lucas Fox, says: \u201cSome property buyers, who want to use a property themselves at some point, are turning to medium-term rentals. The advantage over long-term rentals is that a tenant is not locked in for five or seven years; medium-term contracts are from two to 11 months. There is huge demand from digital nomads.\u201d\n\nHe says the potential net yield of 4.5pc is achievable \u2013 the prime areas for these are the same as the STRs, such as the Quadrat d\u2019Or of Eixample district, with two-bedroom properties more in-demand than one-beds for both types of rental.\n\n\u2018Stopping the avalanche\u2019 of holiday lets\n\nThe rise of medium-term lets (also called seasonal or temporary lets) is also being seen in Valencia city, where there are 9,490 STR listings, according to AirDNA.\n\nThese listed properties must have their own entrances, and whole buildings cannot be converted into STRs in the city\u2019s old town or fashionable beachside district of Cabanyal. But the lack of enforcement has allowed STRs to increase by 15pc since 2021.\n\nIn May, the Valencia Residents Federation requested a moratorium on new tourist apartments to \u201cstop the avalanche\u201d of holiday let properties. The city council had closed down 160 unlicensed holiday let apartments, and last week approved plans to crack down on tourist housing in the historic centre. Valencia has recently approved plans to crack down on tourist housing in the historic centre - Sergio Formoso/Moment RF\n\nGraham Hunt, of agent Valencia Property, says the city is full of guiri gaols (so-called \u201cforeigner prisons\u201d) \u2013 former shops and other ground-floor premises that have been converted into Airbnb lets with security bars on the windows. They retain their status as commercial enterprises avoiding rules for \u2018residential\u2019 properties.\n\n\u201cMost people are looking for a rental investment. They ring up and ask about Airbnb lets but they are 10 years too late. But everything rents out here, there is such a demand, whichever type of rental you do,\u201d he says.\n\nHe puts net yields at 5pc to 9pc for medium-term lets, which are popular with digital nomads, students and house hunters. For three-month rentals, a typical rate is \u20ac70 to \u20ac80 per night for a two-bedroom apartment costing \u20ac200,000 or \u20ac250,000 between the centre and the sea.\n\nThe lack of long-term rentals \u2013 for the same reasons as Barcelona \u2013 has pushed up rates, he adds, so rents are out of sync with average local wages.\n\n\u2018Investors must change their mindset\u2019\n\nA lack of long-term rentals is an acute problem in Malaga city, where there are 7,282 STR listings, up 18.5pc since 2012. It\u2019s still possible to buy apartments that come with STR licences, but the city council announced last week that new licences will only be issued to properties with their own front door \u2013 ruling out most apartments.\n\n\u201cInvestors must change their mindset,\u201d says Jose F\u00e9lix P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a Garrido, of Savills, who says that buyers have been purchasing flats and then flipping them after a year, sometimes making a \u20ac100,000 profit. It is no wonder that property prices are soaring.\n\n\u201cMedium-term lets are one possibility,\u201d he adds. \u201cLots of buyers think they want [to invest in a] long-term rental until they hear about the new regulations. Airbnb is being blamed for the inability for locals to find affordable flats to rent, but it\u2019s only part of the housing problem.\u201d\n\nIn Madrid \u2013 where STR apartments must have separate entrances \u2013 some buyers are also tapping into an embryonic luxury rentals sector, says Ana White of Knight Frank.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a demand from students at the city\u2019s business schools and their families. Some are trying before they buy.\u201d Such apartments cost from around \u20ac1m.\n\nWith moratoriums on STR licences in the Balearic Islands too, Airbnb investment buyers need to look to new areas where there is a shortage of tourist accommodation, says Bram Gallagher. He points to Vigo, Almeria and Pamplona, the top three fastest growth areas for Airbnb listings \u2013 all up over 57pc since 2021.\n\nIn Vigo, in the increasingly fashionable Galicia, the average price for a two-bedroom apartment is \u20ac268,000, according to Kyero.com.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached peak Airbnb in Spain \u2013 we are just seeing it spread to other areas. It is politically expedient to limit Airbnb, but banning it doesn\u2019t end up lowering house prices.\u201d It also increases hotel prices, as seen in New York City, he says. Strict regulations in the city caused STR listings to plunge by 82pc since August 2023. \u201cIt affects accommodation choices and affordability for tourists.\u201d",

        "title": "3 Top Stocks to Buy in July",
        "content": "Investing in the brands that people regularly use is a simple and effective way to grow your savings for retirement. To give you some ideas, three Motley Fool contributors believe now is a great time to buy shares of Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX), Airbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB), and Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS). Let's find out more about these opportunities.\n\nBuy the dip on Starbucks\n\nJohn Ballard (Starbucks): Buying shares of industry-leading companies when they are on sale can pay off in the long run, and the stock market is handing a great opportunity to invest in the world's dominant coffee chain at a discounted price. Starbucks shares are down 17% year to date, but the long-term growth in the coffee market will ultimately benefit this outstanding brand.\n\nThe stock has underperformed this year due to weak comparable-store sales. Starbucks reported a year-over-year decline in global comp sales in the March-ending fiscal second quarter. This decline was most pronounced in China where comp sales dipped 11%.\n\nIncreasing competition, as more coffee brands compete on price, is mostly to blame for the weak sales performance. However, instead of competing on price and hurting profits, Starbucks is focused on leaning into its premium brand positioning to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack. This will benefit the company in the long run.\n\nThe out-of-home coffee market is expected to grow 17% to reach a value of $437 billion by 2028, according to Statista. One important advantage for Starbucks is its customer-loyalty program, in which it had 32.8 million active 90-day members in the most recent quarter, representing an increase of 6% year over year.\n\nWall Street analysts expect the company to grow earnings per share by 11.8% over the next several years. With the stock trading at a reasonable price of 22 times this year's earnings estimate, investors can expect the share price to follow the company's earnings growth in the coming years.\n\nA new leader in travel\n\nJennifer Saibil (Airbnb): Airbnb has become a mainstream alternative to hotels, and in many ways, it has upended the entire travel industry. That makes it \"sticky,\" and unlike many hyped-up disruptors that have come and gone without leaving much of a trace, Airbnb is joining the ranks of the travel leaders.\n\nSales growth decelerated from the triple-digit percentages it saw in 2022 and part of 2023 as it rebounded from the worst of the pandemic, but Airbnb demonstrates continued relevance and resilience by maintaining double-digit revenue growth. Sales increased 18% year over year in the 2024 first quarter even though it faced a tough comparison from a strong Q1 in 2023. It's also consistently profitable, with increasing net income and free cash flow. Net income was $264 million with a 12% margin in Q1, and it generated $1.9 billion in free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbnb operates an asset-light model, and that means it benefits from growth at a low cost. Listings increased 15% year over year in Q1, and while it does have marketing expenses to entice new hosts to join its platform, many of its listings come from current hosts who have created a lucrative business out of hosting several rentals through Airbnb.\n\nIt's very hard for traditional hotel companies to match Airbnb's model. For example, it was uniquely positioned to benefit from the recent total solar eclipse that was best viewed in several U.S. cities where there aren't many hotels. It offers rentals in areas around the world that are otherwise hard to visit, and it makes it easier and cheaper for visitors who want to rent for several weeks at a time or even live in Airbnb's rentals.\n\nIt's always finding new areas to invest in. Recently, it moved its focus to its mobile app. It's launching experiences that \"drop\" in the app and just rolled out collaboration tools for groups to book together. There are many ways it can keep up its growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nAirbnb will release Q2 earnings soon, and the stock is already climbing on high expectations. Expect it to jump with a strong earnings report.\n\nA great brand at a solid value\n\nJeremy Bowman (Disney): It's hard to think of a stronger consumer brand than Disney. The name has been synonymous with family entertainment for a century, including animated films, TV, theme parks, live entertainment, and consumer products like toys.\n\nDisney benefits from an unmatched consumer-products flywheel, which allows it to monetize the same piece of intellectual property over and over again, and its ownership of ESPN gives it a leadership position in sports entertainment.\n\nRecently, that hasn't been enough to make the stock a winner, but that could soon change. Disney tumbled on its earnings report in May after it said that it expected streaming profits to be weaker in the current quarter, but that's exactly the kind of sandbagging that can lead to recoveries on the following quarter's results.\n\nWhile investors seem to be demanding a smoother profit-growth line in the streaming division, they're missing the bigger picture in Disney's evolution. The company reported its first-ever profit in the direct-to-consumer division in the fiscal Q2, and it forecasts overall full-year adjusted earnings per share will grow 25% this year. Earnings should continue to grow from there.\n\nDisney has also consistently beat Wall Street estimates, meaning that the stock is likely even cheaper than the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19 it trades at based on 2025 estimates.\n\nWith Disney's streaming segment finally reaching profitability, profit growth could accelerate from here as well, as its decline in its linear network division becomes less meaningful. That means investors could be looking at a few years, at least, of strong profit growth for the entertainment giant.\n\nDisney is likely to face some challenges in July as the Olympics saps viewers from ESPN and its other channels, but if you take a longer view, it looks like a good time to buy as the price is right and momentum is likely to build from here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Country with the Most Domestic Tourism in the World",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 15 Countries with the Most Domestic Tourism in the World, and in this article we will look at the top country.\n\nDomestic Tourism in a Post-Pandemic World\n\nDomestic tourism refers to trips that individuals take within their own countries and thus, involves no crossing of international borders. Both international and domestic tourism suffered drastically when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), 2020 saw a 73% decline in international tourist arrivals. However, the situation for domestic tourism was a bit different.\n\nIn 2020, Lin et al. conducted a study on 65 regions in four countries, namely Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland. Their analysis showed that domestic overnight stays had a 30% decrease in densely-populated areas, whereas a 15% increase in sparsely-populated areas. A 2020 report from WTO noted that as the tourism industry rebounded, the demand was more likely to shift towards domestic tourism and \u2018nature-based\u2019 outdoor tourism. The organization also anticipated that recovery for domestic tourism would be much stronger than international travel.\n\nThis is why boosting domestic tourism became a COVID-19 policy for many tourism-based economies. The IMF reported that the government of Thailand devised $700 million for advancing domestic tourism. The country also subsidized hotel accommodations by 40% for five million nights in total. Costa Rica moved all national holidays to Mondays, in an attempt to extend weekends and thus encourage domestic tourism. Malaysia spent $113 million in allocating discount vouchers for domestic travel.\n\nThese initiatives helped many countries deal with the blow of losing international travel. Domestic tourism was already a big industry in many nations, with the WTO noting that 75% of tourism expenditure in OECD countries is domestic. In 2022, Grand View Research valued the global domestic tourism market to be worth $1.6 trillion. The market was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $5.8 trillion by the end of the forecast period. According to the 2023 Economic Impact Report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, domestic visitor spending saw an increase of 18.1% in 2023, surpassing 2019 levels.\n\nAirbnb and its Impact on Domestic Tourism\n\nAs travelers flock to domestic locations, companies such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) play a huge role in helping them plan their trips. The company offers a diverse range of locations to stay, from cheap to lavish, which allows individuals to control the amount they want to spend on accommodation. During the 2020 pandemic, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) commissioned a survey of 2,200 US respondents, half of whom mentioned that once the lockdown lifted, they would prefer their first trip to be within a day\u2019s drive. The company also reported that by May 2020, the percentage of Airbnb bookings within 200 miles had grown to cover half of total bookings. This value was only one-third in February 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeeping these trends in view, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) launched its Go Near campaign, encouraging individuals to travel nearby. The company partnered with agencies such as the National Park Foundation and Visit North Carolina to make this possible. Furthermore, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) had been contributing to domestic tourism even before the pandemic. According to a 2021 report by the company, its platform saw a six-fold increase in domestic tourism from 2016 to 2019. The same report also elaborated that during COVID-19, Airbnb\u2019s rise in domestic tourism generated R8 billion for the South African economy, urging economic recovery.\n\nThis trend has continued well into 2024 as well. On February 22, 2024, Airbnb reported that Canada saw eight million domestic arrivals on its platform in 2023, an increase of 30% from 2019. This insight falls in line with a 2024 report by Abacus Data, which noted that within the group of Canadians who plan to travel in 2024, 71% are aiming for domestic locations. A similar situation was seen in the US as well. According to Airbnb, US-based residents traveled to more than 15,000 domestic cities and towns in 2023. You can also check out 20 Countries That Have The Potential To Be Major Tourist Destinations.\n\nAmong other things, one of the reasons why travelers prefer Airbnb is for the experience it offers. A February 2024 report by Airbnb showed that 64% of the company\u2019s guests felt like an Airbnb accommodation provided them a closer insight into local culture, as compared to a hotel. 22% mentioned that they chose Airbnb because it provides a local experience. Meanwhile, 48% mentioned that their Airbnb Hosts helped them find hidden gem locations, which they would not have found out about otherwise.\n\nThus, in order to improve its domestic experiences further, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) introduced a bunch of new features in its 2024 summer release, which occurred on May 1. One of the latest exciting features is the option to plan group trips, where individuals can create shared wishlists, send travel invitations, and access in-app messaging. The company also launched Icons, a specific category for one-of-a-kind stay experiences across movies, sports, food, and more. Examples of Icons include Barbie\u2019s Malibu Dreamhouse in California and the Inside Out 2 Headquarters in Las Vegas. According to Brian Chesky, the CEO, the Icons category managed to get 371 million social media impressions and 8,100 pieces of global media coverage within just one week of its launch.\n\nAs companies like Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) continue making strides in domestic tourism, certain countries are also taking the lead in local travel numbers.

United Kingdom\n\nTotal Number of Domestic Trips (2022): 2.9 Billion\n\nAccording to the 2023 Great Britain Tourism Survey, residents spent \u00a35.3 billion in domestic overnight trips from January to March. However, according to an April 2024 report by Visit Britain, in 2023, overnight trips declined by 7% in Great Britain. A major reason for this was the decline in holiday trips, which hold the second largest segment share in the UK\u2019s domestic trips. Despite this decrease, the United Kingdom still ranks number one on our list of countries with the highest number of domestic tourists.\n\nCurious to learn about other countries with high levels of domestic tourism?

        "content": "(From left) NBC's Lester Holt interview OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky at the Aspen Ideas Festival on June 26, 2024. YouTube/Skift\n\nAirbnb boss Brian Chesky has a ton of experience with regulations. The company faces a ban in Barcelona in a few years, was nearly erased from New York City, and has to deal with countless other regulatory battles around the world.\n\nOn a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival earlier this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman credited fellow panelist Chesky with some key advice: \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking enough about politics and policy, and what that\u2019s going to mean for how the world thinks about AI,\u201d Altman said, paraphrasing Chesky. The two have been friends since Chesky arrived in Silicon Valley in 2008.\n\nDuring the discussion, moderated by NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt, Altman said Chesky advised him how to hire a public policy team, how to map out a regulatory strategy, as well as offering do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.\n\n\u201cBrian was the person who would just sit down with me for three hours every other week, and give me a list and say, \u2018Here\u2019s the five things you got to do. Now, here\u2019s where you\u2019re behind. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re screwing up. Here\u2019s what you got to proactively do. Here\u2019s what you got to think about.\u2019 And it\u2019s basically almost always right. And I learned to just always shut up and follow the advice.\u201d\n\nOpenAI Built a Public Policy Team Earlier Than Other Tech Firms\n\nChesky said Altman\u2019s OpenAI has created a public policy and stakeholder management team much earlier than big tech companies did years ago.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think these platforms would have the impact on society that they now know they have,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cAnd so I think the mindset that Sam has, and even the questions you\u2019re asking him, probably weren\u2019t asked of tech leaders 15 years ago. I think the whole industry\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nAna Makanju has headed global public affairs at OpenAI for the past year. \u201cThis technology will profoundly transform how we live, and we can guide its trajectory, limit abuse, and secure broadly beneficial outcomes,\u201d she said, according to the OpenAI website.\n\nAirbnb had to staff up to deal with public policy, as many cities try to reduce its footprint in the name of affordable housing and quality of life. The public policy team numbered around 200 before the pandemic.\n\nAn Alternative to a Hodgepodge of Regulations?\n\nAirbnb has long argued for consistency so it doesn\u2019t have to deal with regulations that vary wildly depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nChesky and Altman, a former Expedia Group board member, said nations should collaborate on regulatory frameworks for AI.\n\nThey both called for a \u201ctransnational group or body\u201d to help sort out the many issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a race, it\u2019s not going to be done in secret,\u201d Chesky said referring to the development of AI. \u201cBut I think nations can collaborate together. And there could be a transnational group or body that could really align to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nChesky said that would be best for society and \u201cprobably best for entrepreneurs, so they don\u2019t have to comply with 200 different laws.\u201d\n\nHe commented on the challenge of dealing with rotating elected officials and stakeholders in cities around the world.\n\nAltman agreed that a global regulatory framework would be best for society and entrepreneurs. \u201cI think we\u2019re really going to need that.\u201d\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "An Insider At Airbnb Lowered Their Holding Recently",
        "content": "From what we can see, insiders were net sellers in Airbnb, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ABNB ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders sold the stock in greater numbers than they purchased it.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nAirbnb Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent sale by Brian Chesky was the biggest sale of Airbnb shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$152, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 3.2% of Brian Chesky's stake.\n\nYou can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsiders At Airbnb Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Airbnb. In total, Co-Founder Brian Chesky sold US$17m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Airbnb Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Airbnb insiders own about US$28b worth of shares (which is 29% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Airbnb Tell Us?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Airbnb stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Airbnb is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Airbnb has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "content": "Hotel prices in Edinburgh climbed 9pc in the 16 months following the rollout of stricter short-term let rules - Guy Brown/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe SNP has been forced to water-down its crackdown on holiday lets after being accused of driving away tourists.\n\nLandlords have been handed an annual six-week exemption from expensive licences that threatened to cripple Scotland\u2019s tourism industry.\n\nNicola Sturgeon\u2019s licensing scheme, which came into force in October, required owners of short-term lets, including self-catered accommodation and B&Bs, to apply for a licence of up to \u00a3520 to take in guests.\n\nBut under changes to legislation approved by members of the Scottish parliament on Wednesday, hosts will not be forced to buy a new licence when purchasing a holiday-let from another landlord.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPeople building new holiday lets will also be allowed to apply for a provisional licence before building work is complete and hosts will be able to apply for a maximum of three temporary exemptions a year.\n\nThe reversal followed warnings that the short-term let regime had placed Scotland\u2019s tourism industry at risk, with overseas visitor numbers already dwindling and jobs on the line due to reduced revenue.\n\nScotland\u2019s housing minister on Thursday supporting short-term lets is \u201cvital to Scotland\u2019s tourism sector and wider economy\u201d.\n\nFiona Campbell, chief executive of the Association of Scotland Self Caterers, the industry body for self catered accommodation hosts, said: \u201cClearly we are delighted that there has been some movement, but they have merely tinkered around the edges\u201d.\n\nBut she added that the new provisional licence, which is designed to help landlords obtain mortgages on newly constructed holiday lets, may not be good enough for lenders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to provide comfort that you will get your licence. But in reality it means you can\u2019t because you can\u2019t start trading until you actually do get your licence. It\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rule changes mark a climbdown from how the licences initially operated. After the licensing requirement was implemented last year, some councils such as Edinburgh introduced further regulations such as the need to apply for planning permission.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn analysis by listings website Airbnb last month found that half a year on from the new regime, hotel prices had increased, particularly in Edinburgh where there had been a 9pc rise in a year.\n\nThe firm blamed the increase on short-term lets coming off the market due to the new policies putting more pressure on accommodation.\n\nThe new rules have also coincided with a slowdown in Scotland\u2019s build-to-rent sector.\n\nAirbnb also found that during large events, such as Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts in Edinburgh, a shortage of accommodation meant prices surged by 84pc, far higher than in London and Cardiff, where the American singer has also performed.\n\nAndy Fenner, chief executive of the UK Short Term Accommodation Association, another industry body for short-term hosts, said: \u201cThese changes represent an important first step towards creating a better framework for the hundreds of small businesses operating holiday lets across Scotland, as well as local communities.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlthough significantly more work needs to be done, these changes are a step in the right direction. We now look forward to continuing the conversation with the Scottish government to ensure Scotland has a fair and proportionate short-term lets scheme that works for all Scottish businesses, communities, and visitors.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s short-term let licence costs around \u00a3260 for a double room and up to \u00a3520 for a short-term rental house with a maximum occupancy of 10, according official government figures.\n\nPaul McLennan, Scotland\u2019s housing minister, said: \u201cShort-term let accommodation is vital to Scotland\u2019s tourism sector and wider economy.\n\n\u201cThe short-term lets licensing scheme aims to protect the reputation of responsible operators and ensure the sector is regulated in line with other accommodation such as hotels and caravan parks, giving guests assurance of consistent safety standards. The technical updates to the scheme passed by Parliament were introduced in response to engagement with short-term let operators and the wider tourism industry.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure the scheme continues to deliver quality and safety assurance for guests, whilst protecting the needs of local communities.\u201d",

        "title": "You\u2019ve Been Warned! 7 Tech Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.",
        "content": "Technology stocks continue to outperform. Despite predictions that a great rotation into value and small-cap stocks is coming, the reality is that large-cap tech stocks continue to drive the market higher. As the first half of the year draws to a close, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index is up 20% compared to a 15% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index and a 4% increase in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMoving into the year\u2019s second half, there are a number of technology stocks that look set up for success. While many are already up on the year, they have momentum behind them and catalysts likely to drive their earnings and share prices higher in the coming months. For investors, adding technology growth stocks can be a great way to boost a portfolio and outperform the broader market.\n\nYou\u2019ve been warned! Here are seven tech stocks to buy now or regret forever.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) the amazon logo displayed on a sign outdoors\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced it will hold its latest \u201cPrime Day\u201d sales event on July 16 and 17. It will be the 10th Prime Day event held by Amazon and will see millions of products offered at discounted prices. The sales event, which takes place simultaneously in 23 countries, typically gives Amazon\u2019s financial results and its stock a lift during the slow summer months.\n\nInvestors may want to load up on AMZN stock ahead of the upcoming Prime Day and before the shares really takeoff. Amazon stock currently has a Strong Buy rating, with all 42 Wall Street analysts that cover the company rating the shares a Buy. Also, the median price target on Amazon stock is nearly 20% higher than where the shares are currently trading. The consensus view is that this is a tech stock that has room to run.\n\nSo far in 2024, Amazon stock has risen 23%.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock took off after the company announced strong financial results and announced a 10-for-1 stock split that\u2019s taking place on July 12. Now, there are media reports that Broadcom is teaming up with China\u2019s ByteDance, the privately held company behind the social media app TikTok, to develop an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) microchip.\n\nMedia reports say that ByteDance and Broadcom are working on a five-nanometre application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) that will comply with U.S. export restrictions. ByteDance and Broadcom have been business partners since 2022. The Chinese company previously purchased Broadcom\u2019s Tomahawk five-nanometer high-performance microchip.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ByteDance microchip partnership is just one more reason to consider AVGO stock. There looks to be a buy-the-dip opportunity with Broadcom right now as its share price pulled back 14% at the end of June as the broader semiconductor sector endures some turbulence. Broadcom stock remains up 45% on the year.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who want supercharged returns and exposure to cryptocurrencies should consider taking a position in Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). The cryptocurrency exchange reported financial results for this year\u2019s first quarter that showed a surge in profits as trading in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other digital assets accelerates. The company reported EPS of $4.40, 303% higher than the $1.09 expected by analysts.\n\nSales in Q1 totaled $1.64 billion versus the $1.34 billion expected on Wall Street. Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S., said the results were due to a steady rise in crypto trading as the price of Bitcoin reached record highs in March of this year. A year earlier, Coinbase reported a loss of $78.9 million, or 34 cents per share. COIN stock has risen 263% over the last 12 months, beating the gains in nearly all other stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nA fuse has been lit under the stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) after that company also reported better-than-expected financial results. HPE stock vaulted 15% higher after the information technology company posted EPS of 42 cents, which beat the consensus expectation among analysts of 39 cents. Revenue for what was the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter came in at $7.20 billion, topping forecasts of $6.80 billion.\n\nBest of all, management attributed the strong results to rising demand for its AI servers, which is what investors wanted to hear. Company executives said they are benefiting from a loosening in the supply of Nvidia\u2019s H100 microchips used in its servers. As a result, AI systems revenue at HP Enterprise more than doubled sequentially to $900 million in the most recent quarter, with more growth forecast.\n\nHPE stock is now up 25% on the year and looks likely to move even higher in the coming months.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother way to play the boom in microchips and semiconductors is with Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT). The company makes microchip components used by companies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company has been a going concern since 1967 and its early products are housed in the Smithsonian Museum.\n\nAMAT stock is up 46% this year and a top performer, thanks, in large part, to rising demand for its products fueling earnings growth. Applied Materials most recently reported EPS of $2.09, ahead of analysts\u2019 consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 per share. Revenue in the quarter totaled $6.65 billion, topping consensus forecasts of $6.54 billion.\n\nThrough five years, AMAT stock has gained 402%, making it a tech stock to buy.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) Merger Speeds Up the Comeback of T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTelecommunications giant T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) looks like a buy as it moves to acquire the majority of rival U.S. Cellular (NYSE:USM) for $4.40 billion. The purchase includes U.S. Cellular\u2019s mobile phone customers, its network of retail stores and some of its wireless spectrum. T-Mobile said it will use U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless spectrum to improve internet coverage in rural areas.\n\nT-Mobile is also allowing U.S. Cellular customers to keep their current wireless plans or switch to a new plan. The acquisition is working its way through regulatory approvals and a closing date for the transaction has not been announced. But once complete, the addition of U.S. Cellular should bolster T-Mobile\u2019s telecommunications offerings and earnings. TMUS stock has increased 33% over the last 12 months, including an 11% gain this year.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe summer travel season is in full swing, which bodes well for Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). The homestay and short-term rental company sees a noticeable boost in booking and revenue during the third quarter of the calendar year, which includes the summer months. Already this year, Airbnb has seen its financial results power higher as travel hits new all-time highs following the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor this year\u2019s first quarter, Airbnb posted EPS of 41 cents, which crushed consensus analyst estimates of 24 cents. The profit was up 126% from a year ago and the company\u2019s best first quarter ever. Revenue in the period totaled $2.14 billion, which was also ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.06 billion. Additionally, gross bookings came in at $22.90 billion, up 12% year over year, and the company\u2019s free cash flow at the end of the quarter stood at $1.90 billion.\n\nThe strong performance has driven ABNB stock up 12% on the year. More gains can be expected if the company\u2019s financial performance continues to impress.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and AMAT.

Nights and experiences booked totaled a strong 132.6 million, up nearly 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods Raises Outlook\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a significant omnichannel sporting goods retailer, offering athletic shoes, apparel, accessories, and a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, fishing, tennis, golf, water sports, etc.\n\nThe stock has been a big-time winner in 2024, gaining roughly 58% and widely outperforming relative to the general market.

        "title": "YieldMax Provides New Airbnb Options Strategy ETF",
        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nOn Tuesday, YieldMax added to its growing roster of options strategy funds with the launch of the YieldMax ABNB Option Income Strategy ETF (ABNY).\n\nABNY seeks to give investors access to current income and exposure to the common stock share price for Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB). The fund is actively managed and has a net expense ratio of 0.99%.\n\nTo provide access to Airbnb\u2019s stock price, ABNY uses a synthetic covered call strategy to gain indirect exposure. Additionally, the fund benefits from current income accumulated through the call strategy. However, the options contracts do lead to a limit on ABNY\u2019s participation in potential gains from ABNB\u2019s share price returns.\n\nThrough the fund\u2019s synthetic covered call strategy, ABNY buys and sells a variety of call and put option contracts. These include both standardized exchange traded and FLEX options, based on the value of ABNB price returns. Notably, YieldMax adds that the fund does not directly invest in ABNB, and fund shareholders are not entitled to any ABNB dividends.\n\nABNY aims to preserve synthetic long exposure to ABNB through the use of call options. This can allow the fund to participate in the value changes of ABNB\u2019s stock price.\n\nAdditionally, the fund can generate monthly distributions through the use of call writing. ABNY also employs short-term U.S. Treasuries as collateral, which also provide additional income.\n\nSeasonal Benefits\n\nThe fund is coming online amid a busy summer travel season, which may prove to be beneficial for investors seeking to capitalize on Airbnb call options strategies. However, as with many single-issuer options strategies, investing in a fund like ABNY carries a degree of volatility risk.\n\nYieldMax is rapidly emerging as an established fund provider for targeted option income strategy funds. The largest YieldMax ETF, the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY), has over $747 million in assets under management.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit VettaFi | ETF Trends.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\nSPY ETF Quote VOO ETF Quote QQQ ETF Quote VTI ETF Quote JNUG ETF Quote Top 34 Gold ETFs  Top 34 Oil ETFs  Top 57 Financials ETFs\n\nETF Impact of Russell Index Changes VIDEO: ETF of the Week: BondBloxx CCC-Rated USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (XCCC) Dividend Investing in a Growth Market Midyear ETF Opportunities Meet an Advisor: Chris Byrne\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is There Now An Opportunity In Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$168 and falling to the lows of US$141. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Airbnb's current trading price of US$150 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Airbnb\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nWhat Is Airbnb Worth?\n\nThe share price seems sensible at the moment according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Airbnb\u2019s ratio of 19.23x is trading slightly below its industry peers\u2019 ratio of 19.93x, which means if you buy Airbnb today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Airbnb should be trading in this range, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Airbnb\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Airbnb generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -19% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Airbnb. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Currently, ABNB appears to be trading around industry price multiples, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on ABNB, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on ABNB for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. This means there\u2019s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven\u2019t considered today, which can help crystallize your views on ABNB should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio.\n\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Airbnb mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

        "title": "2 Superior Growth Stocks to Buy in the 2024 Bull Market and Hold for the Long Run",
        "content": "The stock market has kept investors on their toes over the last few years. At the midpoint of 2024, it's definitely been a robust period for the market.\n\nThe S&P 500 is trading up about 16% from January at the time of this writing. Bear in mind that the average annual stock market return is in the ballpark of 10%, as measured over nearly 100 years.\n\nIf you're looking for stocks to buy and hold for the long run, you should have a minimum investment horizon of three to five years and a strong thesis for the underlying businesses. On that note, here are two solid contenders to consider that look like no-brainer buys in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is known for its various software platforms for big-data analytics used by private and public organizations around the world.\n\nFor corporate clients like Morgan Stanley and Merck and entities dealing with highly sensitive information, like the United States intelligence community and Department of Defense, Palantir has been a mainstay in digital infrastructure since its founding 20 years ago.\n\nIt doesn't store data. The company creates software platforms that enable clients to better process and review data in order to make decisions that drive more effective operations.\n\nOne example in a commercial context is the pharmaceutical company Merck, which has used software built by Palantir to assist with medical research and drug development as well as predictions for supply chains. Government clients use the software for highly secretive work and tracking their budgets.\n\nLast year, Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to help with decision-making across a wide range of purposes. The fast adoption of AIP is driving strong revenue growth and profitability, as is the company's continued diversification of its revenue mix.\n\nFor many years, it relied almost entirely on government clients, and while these are still a large piece of the pie, growth in commercial clients has exploded.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Palantir reported its sixth consecutive quarter of profitability according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), totaling $106 million. Revenue rose 21% year over year to $634 million. Of that total, commercial revenue came to $299 million, a 27% year-over-year increase, while government revenue rose 16% year over year to $335 million.\n\nPalantir's customer count increased 42% from the prior-year period. Management reports that businesses including a leading energy and infrastructure company in the U.S. and a multinational airline are relying on AIP for many uses. Lowe's Companies, which had not previously used AI, adopted the AIP platform to help over 1,000 customer service agents, subsequently reducing overdue tasks by 75%.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors seem to have a renewed interest in the stock, with shares trading up by more than 60% from a year ago at the time of this writing. The company's growing profitability and expanding customer base bode well, as does its continued expansion into the rapidly evolving world of AI. Long-term investors might want to get a slice of the action over the next five to 10 years.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) is up around 10% year to date, and the company's impressive financial performance has underlined its resilience in a shifting spending environment. People are continuing to spend money on travel, even as many consumers' wallets are showing clear signs of strain.\n\nThe diverse uses for Airbnb's platform are driving growth. For example, the platform helps travelers looking for a boutique hotel stay or a full apartment in their favorite city, and those looking for long-term accommodations. The ability of people to live and work in places different than their actual place of residence for long periods of time is likely driving this growth.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2024 totaled $2.1 billion, an 18% hike from the same quarter in 2023. It was also the most profitable first quarter to date, with net income of $264 million.\n\nThe company continues to be a cash flow machine, generating just shy of $2 billion in cash from operations and the same amount of free cash flow (FCF) in 2023. Its trailing-12-month FCF margin amounted to 41%.\n\nGrowth in short-term bookings and home supply is outpacing long-term stays, but bookings of 28 days or more still account for a notable portion of the overall total. As of the first quarter, long-term stays accounted for 17% of gross nights booked.\n\nChanges by Airbnb have made these stays more affordable, such as new payment options and discounts. Stays of three months or more were up 25% year over year in the first quarter. Active listings rose 17% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, a sign that interest by hosts and guests is driving rapid expansion.\n\nManagement wants to ensure that the platform offers what hosts and guests want. This includes adding new tools that make booking group trips easier plus more aggressive initiatives to remove low-quality listings.\n\nSome investors might be put off by Airbnb's somewhat lofty price-to-earnings multiple of 19, but if you're a long-term investor looking for a quality travel stock with plenty of room left to soar, that price might be worth paying.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Tesla Stock (NASDAQ:TSLA): 2 Catalysts That Indicate a Turnaround",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has performed poorly over the past 12 months due to several factors, ranging from strong competition in the EV space to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s distractions from the company, all exacerbated by valuation concerns. However, I believe two short-term catalysts could indicate that Tesla has hit bottom, so I am bullish on the company\u2019s turnaround prospects today.\n\nIn this article,\u00a0I will detail these catalysts and explain why they may justify the company\u2019s current premium valuation.\n\nThe Robotaxi Potential\n\nDuring Tesla\u2019s shareholder meeting, Elon Musk elaborated on its Robotaxi plans, providing significant insights for Tesla stock investors. Musk explained Tesla\u2019s business model for the Robotaxi service, comparing it to a blend of Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). This model consists of two main components:\n\nTesla will own and operate a fleet of cars. When a user reserves a ride in one of these vehicles, the payment goes directly to Tesla. Additionally, a significant number of robotaxis will\u00a0be owned\u00a0by private individuals. These privately-owned vehicles will also be available for reservation, and the payments for these rides will go to the vehicle owners. This setup allows for flexibility, as owners might offer rides for free to family members or friends.\n\nThis dual-ownership model aims to maximize the availability and utilization of Robotaxis, leveraging both Tesla\u2019s fleet and privately owned vehicles to meet demand.\n\nOne of\u00a0the primary challenges Tesla faces\u00a0is overcoming regulatory hurdles to get its self-driving cars on the roads globally. There are already a few states in the U.S. with autonomous vehicle laws\u00a0and driverless cars operating\u00a0in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas.\u00a0These existing autonomous cars are paving the way for broader regulatory approval in the U.S., which Tesla believes will facilitate its entry into these markets.\n\nElon Musk has noted that it is beneficial for Tesla that other autonomous car companies are cutting through the regulatory jungle. These companies\u2019 operations and data collection in challenging areas help Tesla by providing insights and easing the path for its vehicles. Interestingly, unlike in other\u00a0areas\u00a0where Tesla prefers to lead, Tesla is comfortable not being the first mover in this scenario. Tesla remains confident that its technology will be superior once fully operational.\n\nOn August 8, Tesla will unveil its Robotaxi service. According to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, a long-term Tesla bull, this day will mark a historical event as the company reveals its broader strategy. Ives believes that the market will witness the execution of this strategy alongside the launch of a sub-$30,000 vehicle. He suggests that the bottom for Tesla is in and argues that betting against Elon Musk is the wrong call, considering Tesla\u2019s extensive installed base and deep involvement in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom my perspective,\u00a0valuing Tesla solely as an electric vehicle\u00a0manufacturer\u00a0doesn\u2019t fully capture\u00a0its worth, especially given its valuation, which far surpasses that of traditional car companies.\u00a0The prospect of the Robotaxi service is unprecedented. This disruptive technology, though intangible,\u00a0stands out as a compelling reason for investors to find Tesla\u2019s premium valuation of 74x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio appealing.\n\nTesla\u2019s Leader Is Re-Engaged\n\nIn recent years, concerns have arisen about Elon Musk\u2019s ability to focus on Tesla, given his involvement in multiple ventures such as SpaceX, Neuralink, and others. Critics argue that Tesla requires a dedicated leader, and Musk\u2019s divided attention could potentially harm the company\u2019s success.\n\nHowever, Elon Musk is deeply intertwined with Tesla, embodying its vision and driving innovation. Despite his busy schedule, recent developments indicate a renewed focus on Tesla. This \u201cold school\u201d Musk appears revitalized, especially in light of recent votes of confidence from shareholders.\n\nDuring the recent Tesla shareholder meeting, shareholders re-approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion compensation plan, highlighting their strong support for Musk\u2019s leadership at the company. However, the vote still requires formal legal approval, and its certainty remains uncertain, potentially leading to months of litigation. Earlier this year, the compensation plan encountered challenges in Delaware, where it was described as \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the approval of this plan had a notable impact on Tesla\u2019s stock, reflecting concerns about the company\u2019s leadership. Now, with a clearer indication that Musk will continue to lead Tesla with increased focus and energy, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas believes, and I concur, that there is potential for the company to unify strategies across Elon Musk\u2019s ventures, including xAI and the social media platform X.\n\nIs TSLA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus on Wall Street regarding TSLA reveals analysts are sitting on the fence with a Hold rating. Out of 33 analysts, 10 are Bullish, nine are bearish, and 14 are neutral. The average Tesla stock price target is $176.96, indicating a potential downside of 3.3%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough bearish momentum still prevails over TSLA due to its potentially stretched valuation based on ambitious future projections, I believe that the unveiling of the Robotaxi execution plans could justify TSLA\u2019s valuation. Additionally, resolving concerns over Elon Musk\u2019s leadership may mark a transition from bearish to bullish momentum for the world\u2019s largest EV company.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Former Ace Hotel in downtown L.A. reopens as 'Airbnb on steroids'",
        "content": "The elaborate proscenium arch of the United Theater on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. Recently reopened under new management, the theater will continue to host live events while the attached hotel will offer few services akin to short-term rentals. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe former Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, which helped lead an economic revival on a historic stretch of Broadway a decade ago, has reopened as a minimal-service operation akin to Airbnb, following a strategy that has become increasingly common for struggling hotels in recent years.\n\nNow called Stile Downtown Los Angeles by Kasa, the 1920s-vintage hotel tower has resumed limited operations after shutting down nearly six months ago. Downtown hotels were particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, and some have changed owners or operators.\n\nAce Hotel Group had operated the 182-room hotel near Broadway and Olympic Boulevard since it opened in 2014, even as its ownership changed twice over the years. The chic brand made the Ace a destination for travelers as well as local residents who patronized its buzzy rooftop bar and restaurants.\n\nSouth Korea-based AJU Continuum, which bought the hotel in 2019, announced last week that it had brought in Kasa Living Inc. to operate the property.\n\nKasa, which is based in San Francisco and has a national presence, \"offers the consistency of a major hotel chain with the convenience and character of a modern short-term rental,\" AJU Continuum said in a statement.\n\nAce Hotel said upon its departure that the Broadway hotel would be operated in the future as \"a limited-service, rooms-only operation, managed via a tech platform.\"\n\nThe limited-service model under which guests typically receive codes to get into their rooms via their phones is \"basically an Airbnb on steroids,\" said Donald Wise, a hotel investment banker at Turnbull Capital Group. \"You're not going to someone's house or a condo, but to a box that has no more or less service than an Airbnb would have.\"\n\nThe independent United Theater on Broadway, which is connected to the hotel, will continue to operate as an open venue hosting concerts, performances and special events, AJU Continuum said. The hotel will have a rooftop wine bar but no restaurants.\n\nThe site has had multiple identities since it was built in 1927. Constructed with backing from film luminaries Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith, it originally was meant in part to provide a theater for the United Artists movie production company they founded.\n\nThe Spanish Gothic theater was designed by C. Howard Crane and the tower by Walker & Eisen, the team behind other local landmarks including the Fine Arts Building downtown and the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Beverly Hills. It held offices for rent and a theater where United Artists pictures premiered, starting with Pickford\u2019s film \u201cMy Best Girl.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOther prominent occupants of the property through the years include California Petroleum Corp., Texaco and flamboyant preacher Gene Scott, whose broadcasts were heard nationally. He died in 2005.\n\nThe opening of the Ace in 2014 was a pivotal point in the residential renaissance of downtown that helped spur growth nearby, said Nick Griffin, executive vice president of DTLA Alliance, formerly the Downtown Center Business Improvement District.\n\n\"It was evocative of that particular moment in downtown, arriving as a kind of a hipster paradise,\" he said. \"That area of Ninth and Broadway was a particularly hip area with fashion and hotels at the intersection of the Historic Core, the fashion district and the downtown center.\"\n\nTwo other boutique hotels created in historic buildings followed the Ace to the neighborhood: the Hoxton Downtown LA and Downtown L.A. Proper. Both are also on Broadway.\n\nShort-term rentals in former traditional hotels and apartment buildings have been popping up downtown as business owners work to find financial equilibrium, Griffin said.\n\n\"The new model of short-term rentals is sort of indicative of this moment in downtown as we continue to evolve and innovate coming out of the pandemic.\"\n\nGriffin's improvement district reported that average downtown hotel occupancy, which plunged during the pandemic, has reached nearly 69%, up a percentage point from a year ago. That's close to what is usually considered a healthy rate but down from late 2019 when occupancy was closer to 80% and average room rates were higher.\n\n\"The downtown Los Angeles market is still lagging, hasn't recovered fully to the numbers that were pre-COVID,\" said consultant Alan Reay of Atlas Hospitality Group. \"We are definitely starting to see more distress among owners.\"\n\nChallenges for hotel owners include a reduction in business travelers to downtown offices as more people work from home. They also face high interest rates on their loans and rising labor costs.\n\nLimited service hotels such as Stile may produce more profit for their owners while also lowering rates for guests who don't mind having fewer services, Reay said.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Best Budget-Friendly Corporate Gift for Employees",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 20 Budget-Friendly Corporate Gifts for Employees, and in this article we will look at the best budget-friendly corporate gift for employees.\n\nImportance of Corporate Gifts\n\nAccording to a report by GlobalNewsWire, 68% of individuals state that receiving a memorable gift from their employer has enhanced their relationship with them. This underscores the capacity of gifts to foster positive connections, whether in personal or professional contexts. Data from a survey by Mrs Prindables indicates that 57% of surveyed employees are more likely to remain loyal to a company that provides gifts. In comparison, 62% do not anticipate receiving gifts from their employer this holiday season. This suggests an opportunity for employers to surprise their workers with tokens of appreciation, potentially fostering increased employee loyalty.\n\nThe WorldMetrics Report 2024 indicates that the global corporate gifting market is expected to grow to $242.9 billion. This means that companies worldwide are spending more on gifts for clients, employees, and partners. It shows how important giving gifts is for building good relationships and promoting brands. To make your employees feel valued and respected, your choice of gift is very important.\n\nGifts express gratitude and are more effective than mere objects. Marcel Mauss, a noted anthropologist, explored gift-giving in his 1925 study, \u201cThe Gift.\u201d He revealed its complexity, highlighting its role in shaping relationships within workplaces and with clients. Mauss emphasized the multifaceted nature of gift-giving, involving legal, economic, spiritual, and moral obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate.\n\nGift-giving in the workplace often benefits the giver more than the receiver, yielding both tangible and intangible rewards. Many businesses, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), recognize the importance of fostering a positive company culture through corporate gifting. By offering enticing gifts, benefits and perks, companies create an environment that promotes employee satisfaction, productivity, and creativity. Research, such as a Gallup poll, shows that employees who are actively engaged in their work tend to perform much better than their less engaged colleagues. This heightened level of engagement can lead to a significant increase in earnings per share, sometimes as much as 147%.\n\nTop Corporate Gifting Ideas for 2024\n\nIn 2024, corporate gifting trends are driven by technological innovation, personalization, and a strong focus on sustainability and well-being. Businesses increasingly opt for eco-friendly gifts to show their commitment to environmental responsibility, choosing items like reusable drinkware, eco-friendly office supplies, and products made from recycled materials with minimal packaging. Tech gadgets remain popular, with wireless chargers, Bluetooth headphones, and smart home devices being highly appreciated for their practicality and ability to enhance daily life. Personalization is key, with companies using advanced techniques to create unique, custom gifts that leave a lasting impression.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperience-based gifts are gaining traction, moving beyond traditional tangible items to offer memorable experiences like spa days, cooking classes, or event tickets. These gifts significantly boost employee morale and client loyalty while aligning with the company\u2019s brand values and mission. Health and wellness gifts, such as fitness trackers, yoga mats, and customized health snack boxes, reflect a growing focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle. These options show the company\u2019s commitment to the well-being of its employees and clients, fitting into broader corporate wellness trends.\n\nAdditionally, there is a strong appreciation for cultural and artisan gifts that support local businesses and artisans. Handcrafted items that reflect cultural significance or artisanal dedication are highly valued, offering a story that recipients can cherish. These gifts not only support local communities but also allow companies to showcase their local pride or global outreach, making them perfect for businesses looking to make a meaningful impact through their gifting choices.\n\nWith the dominance of e-commerce giants like Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), finding affordable options has become easier than ever. Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has exhibited steady revenue growth over recent quarters, with current quarter (June 2024) revenue estimated at $136.8 billion, marking a 1.8% increase from the same quarter last year ($134.38 billion). This growth continues into the next quarter (September 2024), where revenue is projected to be $145.7 billion, reflecting a 3% rise from the previous year\u2019s $141.41 billion. Annually, Amazon\u2019s revenue for 2024 is expected to reach $588.05 billion, a 2.3% increase from 2023\u2019s $574.78 billion, with a potential jump to $653 billion in 2025, indicating an 11% growth. This growth is primarily driven by the company\u2019s expanding market share in e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), and various other services. However, the short-term growth rate shows a slight slowdown, likely due to market saturation and broader economic conditions.\n\nIn terms of earnings, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has consistently surpassed expectations, showcasing strong performance. For the quarter ending June 2023, the estimated EPS was $0.35, while the actual EPS was $0.65, an 85.7% surprise. This trend continued in September 2023, with an estimated EPS of $0.53 and an actual EPS of $0.86, a surprise of 62.3%. December 2023 also saw a positive earnings surprise, with actual EPS of $1.00 compared to the estimated $0.80, a 25% difference. For March 2024, the actual EPS was $0.90 against an estimated $0.77, a 16.9% surprise. Looking forward, the estimated EPS for the current quarter (June 2024) is $0.94, and for the next quarter (September 2024), it is $1.06. The full-year EPS for 2024 is projected at $4.18, with an expected rise to $5.31 in 2025.\n\nValuation measures for Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reflect its premium valuation status. The trailing P/E ratio has decreased from 310.38 in Q1 2023 to 49.96, indicating improved earnings. The forward P/E ratio stands at 38.31, showing continued expectations of earnings growth. We should note that these estimates don\u2019t tell much about whether Amazon is a cheap or expensive stock because Amazon has been shoveling its profits back into its business to subsidize either its growth or new initiatives. It isn\u2019t a company that\u2019s trying to maximize its short-term earnings. That\u2019s why we believe Amazon shares will continue to perform better than the market. And we aren\u2019t alone. AMZN is the #1 stock on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nWith this backdrop, let\u2019s explore our list of affordable corporate gifts for employees. The Best Budget-Friendly Corporate Gifts for Employees\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify affordable corporate gifts for employees, we implemented a consensus-based approach to collect information from various sources: including Social Imprints, Snappy, Meetings & Incentives, Babble for Business, Gemnote, and Hoppier. From these blogs we identified popular affordable gift items in 2024, and developed a systematic scoring system. Each gift item we found through our sources was listed, along with the number of times it appeared in sources. In order to refine our search, we checked and averaged out the prices of these gift items from Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), as these platforms are typically deemed affordable.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nWith this backdrop, let\u2019s proceed to #1 budget-friendly corporate gifts for employees.\n\n1. T-Shirts\n\nAverage Price: $6.48\n\nAffordable and practical, corporate t-shirts are a great investment. The saying \u201cless is more\u201d is perfect for T-shirts; all you need is a solid color, and little to no design. Gifting an \u2018Employee of the Month\u2019 t-shirt sounds like pure motivation. This gift option creates a sense of unity and belonging among employees, fostering team spirit and camaraderie.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Amazon but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about The Cheapest AI Stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: none.

        "title": "Overinflated and Overrated: 3 Stocks to Avoid at All Costs",
        "content": "Many stocks fail to deliver on investor promises every year, and this year is no different. Many analysts attribute the poor performance of certain stocks to the worsening economic situation, but reports of international disputes have also contributed to it. With market pressures and geopolitical conflicts at an all-time high, analysts have advised investors to steer clear of specific stocks.\n\nThis article highlights three of the worst-performing stocks that investors should avoid at all costs, or at least until the economic situation gets better. Here\u2019s why Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) are bad investments in the second half of the year.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood Markets is a financial services company based in the United States. It is popular for its products, which help users secure their financial future and manage their assets commission-free. Stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies are some of the assets available on the Robinhood app.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn paper, Robinhood Markets appears to be doing fine. According to its recent quarterly report, the company generated $157 million in earnings in the first quarter of the year and posted a record revenue of $618 million just last month.\n\nHowever, the opposite seems to be the case. Analysts are becoming increasingly convinced that Robinhood Markets is maintaining a false position in the market and is due for a correction anytime now. This is evident from its recent rating downgrade at Citi Research, a global investment bank and financial services provider.\n\nCiti Research analysts believe that despite Robinhood\u2019s strong start to the year, several factors, such as slower retail activity or a pullback in Bitcoin prices, could affect its profitability. Furthermore, there are rumors that the company could face a lawsuit from the SEC. This could prove detrimental, as much of Robinhood\u2019s growth and popularity is thanks to its crypto unit.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks is a popular American computer networking company that specializes in delivering cloud networking solutions for large-scale enterprises, such as data centers and server farms. As a major player in the tech industry, Arista Networks seems like a great stock investment at first glance.\n\nHowever, major analysts like Rosenblatt don\u2019t seem to share this sentiment. They argue that the company\u2019s opportunity in the AI space is not as huge as perceived and that its stock price is currently inflated. They feel that a price correction is due soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks is one of the tech stocks that has greatly benefitted from the recent boom in AI. According to its recent quarterly report, its earnings per share have grown by 44% in the last year.\n\nFurthermore, it has severely overperformed the vast majority of the market, as noted by its 403% increase. For context, the S&P 500 only grew by 85% simultaneously.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb is a global giant in the hospitality and accommodations industry. It is popular for its online marketplace, which facilitates short and long-term housing experiences. Airbnb is available in over 200 countries and regions worldwide.\n\nOn the financial front, Airbnb is not performing too poorly. According to its recent quarterly report, it generated a revenue of $2.14 billion, overperforming analyst\u2019s estimates by 3.98%. However, these numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s dominance in the hospitality space, several analysts \u2014 one of them is Needham & Company \u2014 are voicing concerns about its stock\u2019s potential in the market. They reason that Airbnb\u2019s ability to dominate the global online travel agency through artificial intelligence is grossly overrated. Due to this, the company has downgraded the stock.\n\nThe Needham & Company downgrade is the third downgrade Airbnb has received this year, following similar actions from DA Davidson and Phillip Securities. Lack of faith from analysts is always a red flag and could lead to poor stock performance in the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned +3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb belongs, has gained 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAirbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.66 points to a change of -35.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.37 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Airbnb is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ABNB _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.24 billion and $12.56 billion estimates indicate +13.4% and +11.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $0.41 for the same period compares with $0.18 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.66%. The EPS surprise was +78.26%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Airbnb's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Airbnb is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Brian Chesky with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Note that two of the top three shareholders are also Top Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively, once again pointing to significant ownership by company insiders.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Airbnb\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of Airbnb, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$94b, and insiders have US$27b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Airbnb. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Airbnb better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

        "title": "Dip Before the Rip: 3 Stocks Set to Rebound 25% or Higher in 2024",
        "content": "Investors are perpetually on the hunt for stocks to buy on the dip. This strategy involves buying companies that have experienced a recent decline in their share price but remain fundamentally sound.\n\nBuying the dip can be a lucrative move, especially in volatile markets where corrections provide enormous opportunities. In 2024, there are several candidates worth taking a closer look at. These companies can potentially provide investors with significant returns as they recover from temporary setbacks. Moreover, an improving economy, lower inflation and increased risk appetite are all positive backdrops for a rebound. With unique value propositions, strong earnings growth and robust business models, they all possess the potential to recover by at least 25% or more.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the top tech stocks to buy on the dip in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has revolutionized the travel industry with its innovative business model connecting travelers with hosts offering unique travel experiences. Despite facing setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has delivered incredible growth over the last few years.\n\nOne of the key factors driving Airbnb\u2019s potential for a substantial rebound is the resurgence of travel demand. The sector has remained extremely resilient, and pent-up demand will continue to drive growth for both leisure and business travel. Additionally, a stronger economy coupled with easing interest rates in the back half of 2024 is another positive sign for the company. After reporting record revenue, earnings and free cash flow in the 2023 fiscal year, growth has continued to accelerate. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 18% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.1 billion. Net earnings skyrocketed 126% YOY to $264 million while generating nearly $2 billion in free cash flow from operations. With strong travel demand as a buffer, ABNB stock remains one of the best stocks to buy on the dip in 2024.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another standout candidate for investors seeking lucrative tech stocks to buy on the dip. Known for its suite of creative software products, Adobe has been a leader in creative cloud, digital media and marketing solutions.\n\nAdobe stock has faced pressure in 2024 thus far, with the stock significantly underperforming other major technology companies. The stock is currently down 10% year-to-date (YTD), after posting weak earnings and guidance in the first quarter of 2024. It also faces an antitrust probe from the FTC. The company was sued for failing to disclose certain fees to subscribers and making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions. Despite the recent dip in its stock price due to company-specific challenges, Adobe\u2019s fundamentals remain strong. In Q2 FY24, Adobe delivered record revenue of $5.31 billion. Net earnings rose 21% YOY to $1.57 billion, driven by strong growth across Creative Cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, its generative AI copilot software, Adobe Sensei, aims to accelerate design and productivity for its customers. These factors enable the company to return value to shareholders and drive growth in the second half of 2024.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD), a global fast food giant, is another excellent stock to consider buying on the dip. Despite facing challenges in 2024, the company is embracing the digital age and working to expand its footprint globally.\n\nOne of the core strengths of McDonald\u2019s is its brand recognition and extensive global footprint. The company has a strong presence in 118 countries and territories, serving millions of customers daily. It has been up against a tough macroeconomic environment in 2024 but has remained extremely resilient.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been proactive in modernizing its operations, including the expansion of its loyalty rewards program. Its comparable sales have also marked its 13th consecutive quarter of growth in Q1 FY24. That is an extremely impressive feat, but the stock has not responded favorably. Moreover, its valuation looks extremely attractive, with the stock trading at just 20 times its forward earnings. Despite these positive developments, MCD stock continues its slide down 14% YTD. If you\u2019re looking for promising stocks to buy on the dip, McDonald\u2019s should certainly be one of the first places to look.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Tubi CEO Anjali Sudwants all eyes on the free streaming platform, a former Neuralink employee says she was fired for being pregnant, and TaskRabbit's CEO shares lessons from her 'adult gap year.' Have a great Tuesday!\n\n- Gap year. In 2018, Ania Smith and her husband quit their jobs at Airbnb and Glassdoor, respectively, to take an adult gap year. They pulled their three kids\u2014then 6, 8, and 10\u2014out of school in the Bay Area\u2019s Marin County and enrolled them in school in Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, Smith and her husband studied Spanish and took up horseback riding, drumming, and dance.\n\nSix years later, Smith is back in Silicon Valley as the CEO of TaskRabbit. She isn\u2019t sure if she would be in the role today without her gap year, but she\u2019s certain the experience shaped her perspective on work and life.\n\n\u201cWe had crazy jobs before we left,\u201d says Smith, who led host services for Airbnb. Rather than pursue the digital nomad lifestyle, \u201cwe wanted to choose time away from work to have time to breathe, reflect, and reevaluate\u2014to think about whether we wanted to come back to the tech industry, to Silicon Valley, or do something else altogether with our lives.\u201d TaskRabbit CEO Ania Smith\n\nThey saved for years to pursue their plan, which was intended to give the parents breathing room and help their kids build resilience in a new environment. (Smith moved to the U.S. at age 12 from Poland without speaking English.) During their gap year, the couple considered everything from relocating to the smaller tech hub of Park City, Utah, to switching industries and moving to Smith\u2019s home state of South Dakota. \u201cWe would spend hours debating these topics\u2014what we want out of life, what our goals are, what would make us happy,\u201d Smith recalls.\n\nA year later, they wound up back where they started\u2014with a few minor, but meaningful, adjustments. They moved from Marin to Oakland\u2014still in the Bay Area but a \u201cvery different environment,\u201d Smith says. Smith\u2019s husband pivoted from sales operations to finance. And Smith wound up as director of courier operations for Uber. \u201cI decided that I actually really loved working in tech,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s about having the confidence that this is the right choice, instead of always thinking, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe gap year also set her on the path to obtain a CEO job. \u201cIt gave me a better perspective on what I want\u2014and a much better plan for what I needed to do to get there because I had the space to think about it,\u201d she says.\n\nToday, she says the experience influences how she approaches leading TaskRabbit, the freelance labor marketplace owned by Ikea. \u201cWe\u2019re more empathetic, and it helped us be more open to new ideas and new experiences\u201d rather than taking the easier route of \u201cstay[ing] in the status quo,\u201d she says.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmma Hinchliffe\r\nemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com\n\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

        "content": "Columbus Circle in New York City Anthony Delanoix / Unsplash\n\nRoughly nine months since New York City cracked down on short-term rentals by requiring hosts to register, the Office of Special Enforcement has approved just 2,242 applications.\n\nThat figure shows how few short-term rentals there are in the five boroughs since the city imposed Local Law 18 last September. In addition to the registration requirement, hosts must be present during the stay, which must be fewer than 30 days, and a maximum of two guests are allowed. Bedroom doors can\u2019t have locks.\n\nIn January 2023, there were about 40,000 listings in the city, according to Bloomberg, most of them on Airbnb. There are undoubtably are more than 2,242 listing nows because registered hosts can have multiple listings. But the decline in short-term rentals in NYC is clear.\n\nAs of June 10, the latest figures available, the OSE has caught up on a backlog of pending applications. The OSE received 6,328 applications, and it made a determination on 99.5% of them: It either granted, rejected, or returned the application to the applicant.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\nGranted: 2,242 host applications. That\u2019s 35.4% of applications submitted.\n\nDenied: 1,595 applications. That\u2019s 25.2% of all applications submitted.\n\nReturned: 2,460 applications. That\u2019s 38.9% of all applications submitted. An application could be returned for various reasons, including incomplete information or to make corrections. Some 30 of those 2,460 have been returned to the OSE and were under review.\n\nChristian Klossner, executive director of the Office of Special Enforcement (OSE), detailed the benefits of the policy to Skift in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Short-Term Rental Registration program has been pivotal in protecting the city\u2019s housing stock from illicit activity and keeping New Yorkers safe,\u201d Klossner said. \u201cThe implementation of the registration law led to a massive reduction in illegal short-term rental listings.\u201d\n\nHe said Local Law 18 \u201chas effectively prevented the misuse of thousands of permanent housing units for illegal short-term rentals.\u201d\n\nWhile the city sees the implementation of the host registration law as a victory for New York City neighborhoods and the curbing of illegal short-term rental activity, Airbnb and some hosts don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nAt the Skift Short-Term Rental Summit in Manhattan earlier this month, Airbnb\u2019s Jay Carney, who heads up the company\u2019s policy unit, argued that hotel prices are soaring, and there\u2019s been no benefit in terms of rents or affordable housing.\n\nA former New York City host spoke at the summit about how homeowners in the outer boroughs are losing their homes because they can only legally have guests for stays of 30 days or longer.\n\nStory continues\n\nA chunk of the city\u2019s hotel inventory has been allotted to house migrants, which has contributed to the rising hotel prices.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Las Vegas Whacks Homeowner With Fine Of Almost $200,000 For Unlicensed Airbnb Rental",
        "content": "Las Vegas Whacks Homeowner With Fine Of Almost $200,000 For Unlicensed Airbnb Rental\n\nLas Vegas recently issued a $180,000 fine to a city homeowner for allegedly operating an unlicensed short-term rental in 2021. The hefty fine reflects late fees and interest on an initial fine of $2,132, originally issued to homeowner Xin Tao in August 2021. This situation highlights the extreme measures some cities take to curb short-term rentals.\n\nConsidering that hotel room revenue is significant to the city's economy, it's no surprise that Las Vegas has a strict licensing system and code of conduct for short-term rentals. Xin Tao finds himself caught in the middle. According to Tao, the fine originated when a former tenant posted his home on Airbnb without his knowledge in 2021. Naturally, he thinks the former tenant should pay the fine.\n\nUnfortunately for Tao, Las Vegas is fining him for allegedly \"permitting\" his house to be listed on Airbnb. Las Vegas authorities began looking into the address after receiving multiple complaints from residents who suspected a short-term rental was being operated there. This prompted the city to conduct more than 10 inspections of the premises before matching pictures of the house from both Realtor.com and Airbnb.com.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nThat was all the evidence the city needed, and they issued a notice detailing the prohibition on short-term rentals along with the fine. Tao says he tried to evict the tenant, but since Airbnb and Las Vegas City Code Enforcement failed to provide him with evidence such as listings or inspection results, he lost the case. Tao said the company managing the short-term rental used photos of his home without permission.\n\nHe then brought his protest to City Hall, where he petitioned to have the fine lifted. During a January city council meeting on this issue, Las Vegas City Code Enforcement manager Eric McCoy certified that there was no short-term license for Tao's property. As a result, the city council voted to uphold the original fine and place a lien against the property for the outstanding balance.\n\nThe original $2,132 fine has grown to $180,000 because Las Vegas's short-term rental code calls for unpaid fines to incur a penalty fee of $500 per day without limit. So, the fine that Tao originally didn't pay has grown at a geometric rate and now it's large enough for his house to be auctioned off at a lien sale (although the city has not yet initiated the auction process).\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\n\nTao has responded by suing the city. His attorney, Andrew Bao, believes that the city was negligent in allowing fines to accrue at the rate of $500 per day for two years without notifying his client of the debt. Bao also believes that the city's failure to notify his client about the fines violated Xin Tao's due process rights under the Nevada Constitution.\n\nBao's legal filing states, \"To have a $2,132 fine astronomically balloon to $180,000, without notice for more than two years, is a violation of due process and Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights. Further, the $180,000 is an excessive fine and punishment in violation of Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.\" Bao's suit demands $15,000 in damages plus attorney's fees, a reversal of the $180,000 fines, and an injunction preventing the city from foreclosing on Tao's home.\n\nUnfortunately, Bao and his client have already lost one significant battle. At a May 13 hearing, District Judge Nadia Krall denied Bao's petition to have the fine thrown out because the property owner didn't appeal the fine within 25 days of the city council ruling that upheld the $180,000 fine. Krall's ruling stated, \"Petitioner's failure to timely file his Petition leaves this Court without subject matter jurisdiction and the Petition must be dismissed.\"\n\nThat leaves Tao's fine intact, which means his house is still subject to a lien sale. Considering that Krall's ruling upheld the $180,000 fine, it's difficult to imagine the rest of Tao's lawsuit ending positively for him. It's an expensive lesson for Tao. Regardless of how Tao's lawsuit ends, Las Vegas has sent a clear signal that it won't handle unlicensed short-term rentals with kid gloves.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nPrivate credit offers up to 20% APY to potential accredited investors looking to capitalize on this growing asset class.

Despite multiple headwinds weighing down its business over the years, it has proven remarkably resilient. Its 3-year average revenue growth shows this, which stands at an enviable 44%. Moreover, the growing consumer trend toward travel and experiential spending points to an even brighter trajectory ahead for ABNB.\n\nWhile ABNB\u2019s first-quarter (Q1) performance may not have met the stock market\u2019s expectations, it still managed to deliver impressive results. Despite the guidance for the upcoming quarter falling short of expectations, the company\u2019s financial strength remains evident.\n\nRevenues surged 18% surge to $2.14 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $2.06 billion. The platform\u2019s strong top-line performance was mainly linked to significant gains in nights and booked experiences. More importantly, its net income soared 126% year-over-year (YOY) to a record $264 million. Also, Airbnb generated a robust $1.9 billion in net cash from operating activities and free cash flow for Q1.\n\nTherefore, with its tremendous financial health and leadership position in its niche, ABNB stock is an excellent buy-the-dip candidate.\n\nHilton Worldwide (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) is a titan in the hotel industry. With its mix of comfort and upscale locations, the hospitality giant has effectively met the demands of amenities-seeking travelers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHLT has been an excellent stock to hold, posting double-digit growth across multiple post-pandemic quarters. Last year was particularly impressive, with its stock jumping over 44%, a testament to its robust recovery and market confidence.\n\nIts recently released Q1 report saw it comfortably exceeding analyst earnings expectations, considerably increasing its full-year outlook. Revenue increased a healthy 12.2% to $2.57 billion during the period, led by gains in \u2018franchise and licensing fees\u2019 from increased hotels and higher occupancy rates. Additionally, its EPS of $1.53 shot up by 11 cents, its 9th consecutive quarterly earnings beat.\n\nMoreover, Hilton\u2019s management has done remarkably well in refining business operations for peak efficiency. Its adept adaptation to market trends makes it a standout player in the hospitality sphere.\n\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL) Royal Caribbean (RCL) ship Allure of the Seas, docked.\n\nSource: Laszlo Halasi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cruise industry has rebounded impressively post-pandemic. Despite the return to normal booking rates, many debt-laden cruise line operators are buckling under the pressures of higher interest rates. However, with the expected interest rate cut later this year, borrowing costs will likely decrease, boosting cruise lines like Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL).\n\nRCL, in particular, has been experiencing robust demand, with its stock up north of 55% in the past year. It reported a record Wave Season, led by incredible April bookings in terms of volume and pricing, leading to comfortable top-and-bottom-line beats. Additionally, net yields surged 19.3% in constant currency due to higher ticket prices and fleet improvements.\n\nIn its Q1 earnings call, CEO Jason Liberty highlighted the stellar performance of existing and new ships, particularly the Icon of the Seas, which blew past expectations. This monstrous success underpins the firm\u2019s confidence in achieving its 2024 financial goals and capturing a bigger slice of the $1.9 trillion global vacation market.\n\nAs we advance, RCL forecasts second-quarter (Q2) EPS between $2.65 and $2.75, outperforming the $2.37 consensus. It also projects its EPS to fall in the $10.70 to $10.90 range against a consensus of $10.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 17, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Airbnb ABNB, Uber Technologies UBER, Robinhood HOOD, Meta Platforms META and Reddit RDDT.\n\nHow to Trade IPOs: Private vs. Public Investing\n\nInvesting in private and public markets are entirely different endeavors, though they share some similarities: innovation, earnings growth and sound management are integral drivers that determine investment performance of both.\n\nUnderstanding Private Markets vs. Public Markets\n\nBelow are five main distinctions between private and public markets that investors must understand, including:\n\nRisk Appetite\n\nWhether you're investing in private or public companies, each endeavor is risky. However, assuming all else is equal, private firms are far riskier than public firms. Private firms are often earlier in their growth curve (or are just an idea) and do not have to meet the same stringent requirements of a public stock exchange. That said, if successful, the reward for investing in a private firm is far greater because investors on the ground floor can enjoy the company's full growth and potentially take advantage of an IPO.\n\nA private investor or VC (venture capitalist) should be considered a home run hitter. While private investors will \"strike out\" more, they can be successful by hitting home runs and gaining a piece of the next Airbnb or Uber Technologies before everyone else.\n\nLiquidity and Holding Period\n\nBecause public companies are traded each weekday on a major stock exchange like the S&P 500 Index, they offer far more liquidity. Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage depends on the eye of the investor. For example, a private investor may be forced to hold for years before they can even think about selling.\n\nIn other words, if the investment is good, they will be forced to hold and can potentially catch the next multi-bagger (however, this works in both directions). Conversely, a public investor can quickly and easily exit a position they do not feel comfortable in.\n\nAccess\n\nPublic markets have an overwhelming advantage in terms of access. A public investor only needs to fund an account at a discount broker such as Robinhood to take advantage of fresh IPOs. Conversely, private investors must become \"accredited\" to invest in less-regulated securities like private firms. Accredited investors must have a certain income. Furthermore, most private companies require a minimum investment, while public investors can invest any amount they wish.\n\nAvoid Common IPO Pitfalls\n\nLike most investments, the individual investor's personal situation and investing framework will play an important role in which direction to take. Success can be found in both public and private investing but since most investors only have access to public markets, we will break down some common IPO pitfalls to avoid.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Insider Selling and Lockup Expiry\n\nWait for Price Discovery\n\nBuying an IPO on day one is a bad decision for most investors for two reasons: First, it generally takes time for the market to find equilibrium or price discovery. Second, insiders and early investors can use the liquidity event to sell shares. The Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) IPO was a perfect example. Facebook went public in May 2012. However, shares did not eclipse the IPO high until late 2013.\n\nSolution: Wait for the lockup expiry (the period insiders must wait before selling shares) to pass, and let the price settle and form a base structure.\n\n2. Slower Growth\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Mark Cuban explained the problem with IPOs: \"Companies are waiting seven, nine, ten years or longer to go public and by then their hyper-growth is typically gone.\" In other words, instead of going public while the company is still growing rapidly, firms wait until growth is slow, and worse, use the IPO as a liquidity event to sell into.\n\nSolution: Look for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank or robust EPS estimates. Zacks Consensus Estimates aggregate earnings estimates from several prominent banks to derive a consensus estimate. Ideally, an IPO should have double-digit or triple-digit EPS growth.\n\n3. Lack of Fundamental Catalysts\n\nBullish catalysts are necessary for a stock to grow because competition is fierce on Wall Street.\n\nSolution: Find a company with a unique and new bullish catalyst. For example, social media firm Reddit, which just went public, benefits from the AI revolution because its platform is optimal for training large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPublic and private investing each have pros and cons. To be successful in public investing, investors should avoid three common pitfalls.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

In that report, analysts expect Airbnb, Inc. to post earnings of $0.91 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 7.14%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.74 billion, up 10.29% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $4.67 per share and a revenue of $11.24 billion, indicating changes of -35.5% and +13.37%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Airbnb, Inc.

        "title": "Portugal might have cracked down on golden visas after a housing crunch\u2014but repeat visitors who stay at Airbnbs are still very welcome",
        "content": "When an easy gateway for foreigners into Portugal became a nightmare for locals, the country had to move quickly.\n\nIt restricted its famous \u201cgolden visa\u201d program as it set off a massive housing crisis that priced out Portuguese people. The expedited path to residency welcomed digital nomads but also more than doubled home prices in eight years and prompted protests due to exorbitant rents.\n\nWhile Portugal is still recovering from the string of events that an influx of expats spurred, it isn\u2019t closed to the idea of repeat tourists or short-term rentals\u2014especially in the country\u2019s second-largest city, Porto.\n\nFamous for its historic sites and port wine, Porto has also experienced soaring interest among tourists and expats alike. Yet, the local government sees that as a boon to changing the city\u2019s course.\n\n\u201cThe repeating tourist is the best tourist we can have,\u201d Rui Moreira, Porto\u2019s mayor, told Bloomberg. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where we should focus our attention.\u201d\n\nHis hope? Tapping on short-term rentals, such as those offered by Airbnb, as a way to regenerate the city and save it from possible ruin.\n\nMoreira acknowledges that the city needs to be selective about where it allows or avoids such rentals, given Portugal\u2019s Airbnb restrictions announced last year. Still, the rising tide of tourists could help change the city for the better.\n\nPortugal is an easy sell for anyone looking to move there\u2014warm weather, great cuisine, low cost of living, and, until recently, a relatively low barrier for entry. But golden visas have been contentious, with Portuguese political parties disputing whether or not it was instrumental in worsening the housing crisis.\n\nPortugal isn\u2019t alone in walking back its attractive residency route for the wealthy\u2014Spain recently announced it would scrap its golden visa in a bid to make housing affordable again.\n\nThe rejigged program in Portugal now bans property as a route for investing in the country to gain residency rights. Will that help fix the broken housing market? It\u2019s hard to tell just yet. In Spain, for instance, the golden visa scheme had little impact on the lack of housing, property website Idealista found. PORTO, PORTUGAL: Riverside balconied homes and cafes in bright colours in Ribeira by the River Douro in Porto, Portugal. (Photo by Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\nFinding the balance\n\nPortugal attracted a record-breaking number of tourists last year\u2014up 19% from 2022 to over 18 million. Tourism is one of the economy\u2019s key pillars, accounting for nearly 15% of its GDP.\n\nDespite its significance to the country, the travel and tourism industry has been at the center of recent pains for locals struggling to find affordable housing.\n\n\u201cWhat we think is expensive, is cheap for them,\u201d Moreira said of Portugal\u2019s property crisis, referring to expats.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe mayor wants to diffuse the volume of tourists by encouraging them to visit the less sought-after areas and creating a stream of repeat visitors to the city. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s also meant more expats live in Porto now\u2014but Moreira thinks they have \u201ca very significant impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been seeking to attract golden visas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so much a city of retirees. We\u2019re much more a city of young nomads who come here to work at these companies.\u201d\n\nPorto\u2019s houses have become 32% more expensive in the last five years. It plans to invest \u20ac76 million in housing between 2022 and 2026, including building new homes and paying private homeowners to sublet their properties at lower rates.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a magic wand for the issue of housing,\u201d Moreira said. \u201cWe have to find fair measures and various medicines.\u201d\n\nAirbnb didn't immediately return Fortune's request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Best Travel Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "With the world increasingly embracing travel in the post-pandemic era, the industry is set for continued growth throughout the remainder of 2024. June is already upon us. Thus, investors might worry that the industry\u2019s upside has already been priced in. Yet, many of the best travel stocks to buy seem to remain attractively priced, powered by the enduring \u201crevenge travel\u201d trend that emerged after the pandemic and is still going strong.\n\nDespite volatile exchange rates and inconsistent levels of affordability, the desire to travel remains stronger than ever. According to fresh data from Mastercard (NYSE:MA), nine out of the last 10 record-setting spending days in the global cruise and airline industry have already occurred this year. Travelers are also extending their trips by an extra day compared to pre-pandemic times, indicating longer holiday periods.\n\nFurther, the payments network behemoth noted a record high of 15.9 million Americans traveling internationally in the first quarter of 2024, while Japan witnessed over 3 million passenger arrivals in March 2024 alone. This travel activity surge seems to be powered by a robust labor market and a rising desire to travel, providing a splendid tailwind for the best travel stocks to buy. Let\u2019s take a look at three of the best industry players to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is benefiting from the current travel boom like few others. As the leading player in peer-to-peer accommodation rentals and experience booking space, Airbnb continues to take the industry by storm despite some regulatory issues from time to time. Precisely because of its unique growth story and impressive financials, I bought ABNB stock a few years ago and have not sold a single share since.\n\nTo highlight Airbnb\u2019s sustained momentum post-pandemic, the company\u2019s revenues grew by 17.8% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, reaching $2.14 billion. This impressive figure came in on top of last year\u2019s (Q1 2023) top-line growth of 20.5%, which, in turn, was after the prior year\u2019s (Q1 2022) growth of 57.6%. Demand for unique accommodations and local experiences is skyrocketing among travelers, and Airbnb seems like the only guy in town to serve this trend despite efforts by competitors to penetrate the space.\n\nMoving forward, Airbnb\u2019s prospects appear robust. I am especially impressed by Airbnb\u2019s creative approach to innovation. Its introduction of \u201cIcons\u201d last month is a great example that will likely see the company hit some positive global headlines. Simultaneously, Airbnb is a free cash flow powerhouse with significant prospects to build balance sheet equity and return cash to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin hit 89% in Q1, a figure few to no companies can match.\n\nStory continues\n\nHilton (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHilton (NYSE:HLT) is another top travel stock to take advantage of the ongoing industry boom. While Airbnb attracts travelers with its unique accommodations, many still prefer the comfort and luxury of traditional hotels. As a leading hotel industry player, Hilton is exceptionally well-positioned to cater to this market segment. It offers a blend of comfort and upscale locations that appeal to amenities-seeking travelers.\n\nHilton\u2019s revenues increased by 12.2% in the first quarter, reaching $2.57 billion. During the quarter, the company made substantial progress in its \u201cfranchise and licensing fees\u201d segment, driven by an increase in the number of hotels operating under its brands and higher occupancy rates. Its double-digit growth after several quarters of post-pandemic recovery momentum reflects the travel industry\u2019s continued surge.\n\nThe key to Hilton\u2019s success lies in management\u2019s dedication to streamlining the business model for maximum efficiency. Most of its 7,626 properties, containing about 1.2 million rooms, are franchised. Accordingly, the double-digit revenue growth in Q1 translated into even stronger earnings growth. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose by 23.4% in Q1 to $1.53. The current state of the industry indicates that Hilton will see equally strong growth throughout the rest of the year.\n\nDespegar.com (DESP) two women carrying luggage in an airport\n\nSource: Shine Nucha / Shutterstock\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s not overlook Despegar.com (NYSE:DESP), which can be a top choice for leveraging the thriving travel sector. Despegar is smaller than its counterparts in the industry, and focuses predominantly in Latin America. There, it provides a wide range of services, including flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals and other services.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s exposure to the Latin American market, there are major risks to consider. One such risk is the possibility of unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds. However, this region offers significant growth prospects as well. With Latin America increasingly embracing travel, Despegar is set to capture the benefits of this growing market trend.\n\nDespegar posted record revenues of $706.0 million last year, up a significant 31% from the previous year\u2019s $538.0 million. This was notably higher than its pre-pandemic revenues of $525.0 million in 2019. Additionally, in line with the continued resurgence of the travel industry, Wall Street anticipates yet another record-breaking fiscal year in 2024, with consensus estimates projecting revenues to reach $822.0 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis held a long position in ABNB.

        "title": "Does Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?",
        "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nWhat Is Airbnb's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, Airbnb had US$1.99b of debt, at March 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$11.1b in cash, so it actually has US$9.10b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Strong Is Airbnb's Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Airbnb had liabilities of US$14.1b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$2.50b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$11.1b in cash and US$175.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$5.37b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.\n\nSince publicly traded Airbnb shares are worth a very impressive total of US$93.8b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Airbnb boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nBut the bad news is that Airbnb has seen its EBIT plunge 14% in the last twelve months. We think hat kind of performance, if repeated frequently, could well lead to difficulties for the stock. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Airbnb can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Airbnb has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Airbnb actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWe could understand if investors are concerned about Airbnb's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$9.10b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$4.2b, being 249% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Airbnb's use of debt. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Airbnb, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\n\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Merger Mania: 3 Stocks to Buy as Industries Consolidate",
        "content": "A recent article from Barron\u2019s discussing Focus Financial Partners\u2019 consolidation efforts in the registered investment advisor industry. Now owned by private equity firmsClayton, Dubilier & Rice and Stone Point Capital, it got me thinking about stocks to buy that are consolidating their industries.\n\nWith interest rates higher, you would think that mergers and acquisitions would slow, but there will always be acquisitive types pursuing roll-up strategies on a regional and national basis.\n\nOne only needs to look at the alcoholic beverages industry over the years to understand how consolidation has influenced the industry. Diageo (NYSE:DEO) was formed in 1997 through the merger of Grand Metropolitan and Guinness. In 2008, InBev merged with Anheuser-Busch to form Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are extreme examples in terms of deal size. Roll-ups often involve smaller transactions over several years until economies of scale are reached.\n\nSo, who are public companies consolidating industries in 2024? Here are my three stocks to buy.\n\nQXO (QXO) APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOn June 6, QXO Inc. (NASDAQ:QXO), formerly known as SilverSunTechnologies, announced that it had closed its $1 billion equity investment previously announced in April.\n\nJacobs Private Equity put up $900 billion while co-investors including Sequoia Heritage \u2013 an affiliate of Sequoia Capital, a leader in the venture capital industry, who\u2019ve invested in startups such as Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) \u2013 chipped in the other $100 million.\n\nQXO is the brandchild of Brad Jacobs, who has built several billion-dollar companies over the years, including United Waste, now partofWaste Management (NYSE:WM), United Rentals (NYSE:URI) and XPO (NYSE:XPO).\n\nJacobs used a combination of acquisitions and organic growth to build these industry-leading businesses. He\u2019s now set his sights on the building products distribution industry.\n\n\u201cQXO plans to become a tech-forward leader in the $800 billion building products distribution industry. The Company is targeting tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue in the next decade through accretive acquisitions and organic growth,\u201d stated QXO\u2019s June 6 press release.\n\nIn Bloomberg\u2019s Odd Lots podcast in January, Jacobs laid out his rationale for going after a big piece of this market. He pointed out that there are 7,000 distributors in North America, and 13,000 in Europe, most of which are privately owned.\n\nCreate a public company to execute the roll-up strategy and then integrate technology into every aspect of its business, and in the process, totally modernize the building prid distribution industry, making billions for shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s not to like?\n\nConstellation Software (CNSWF) 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConstellation Software (OTCMKTS:CNSWF) is a Toronto-based company that has been consolidating vertical market software businesses since its founding by venture capitalist Mark Leonard in 1995.\n\nToday, it has six operating platforms catering to virtually every industry imaginable, consisting of more than 800 companies participating in over 100 vertical markets.\n\nOne of the positives of the consolidation strategy if you\u2019re buying right is the human capital you gain from these acquisitions. Yes, you\u2019re buying software assets and intellectual property, but you\u2019re also acquiring the talented people that built those assets.\n\nThe Economist wrote about Constellation last November, calling it the tech version of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). I would agree with that characterization.\n\n\u201cLike Berkshire but in contrast to private equity or VC funds, Constellation has no exit clock ticking. It can thus be patient with investment decisions. Mr Leonard\u2019s annual letters to investors echo Mr Buffett\u2019s in describing the company as a \u2018good perpetual owner.\u201d\n\nAn investment in Constellation five years ago has appreciated by 211%, 2.5x the S&P 500. As a result, it has the 11th-highest market capitalization on the S&P/TSX Composite Index.\n\nAs long as Leonard is involved, Constellation remains one of Canada\u2019s best investments.\n\nPool Corp. (POOL) Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming pool\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019ve followed Pool Corp. (NASDAQ:POOL), the world\u2019s largest wholesale distributor of supplies and equipment, since before it changed its name from SCP Pool in 2006.\n\n\u201cIn the five years between 2014 and 2019, Pool increased its sales by 42% to $3.2 billion and its adjusted EBITDA by 79%, to $382 million. It now generates 6% of its revenue outside North America, and that number is growing by the day,\u201d I wrote in September 2020.\n\nIn April, Pool and Spa News looked back on the industry consolidation that\u2019s taken place, and is still taking place. At the end of 2020, Pool had 398 locations worldwide. That\u2019s grown to 442 as of March 31.\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest competitor, Heritage Pool Supply Group, has 115 locations across 32 states.\n\nSRS Distribution, which owns many construction-related distribution and wholesaling businesses, also owns Heritage. It, in turn, is owned by Los Angeles private equity firm Leonard Green and Partners, who acquired SRS for over $3 billion in 2018.\n\nSRS launched Heritage in August 2021. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) just acquired SRS for $18.25 billion, including the assumption of debt.\n\nDespite Pool having Home Depot as a competitor, it continues to add approximately 10 locations annually, using a disciplined approach to acquisitions. Its 2014 operating margin was 8.4%. In 2023, it was 13.5%. It expects to continue pushing this higher in the years ahead.\n\nPool is the ultimate consolidation play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

        "content": "It\u2019s no surprise that trading alongside other investors facilitates confidence. After all, there\u2019s safety in numbers. And this sense of security can be heightened when top Wall Street analysts endorse such collective ideas. However, for higher-than-average returns, you may want to consider contrarian stocks.\n\nBy that, I\u2019m referring to market ideas that aren\u2019t exactly darlings on the Street. In this case, all of the publicly traded companies listed below feature analyst consensus ratings of hold. Stated differently, we\u2019re talking about opportunities which the experts are pensive on. Given the present market environment, a hold might as well be a sell.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s always possible for even the experts to get things wrong. Yes, they may have years of experience along with targeted education in the field. However, they\u2019re also humans and humans make mistakes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBesides, the biggest returns usually don\u2019t come from following everyone else. If you prefer marching to your own rhythm, these are the contrarian stocks to consider.\n\nLyft (LYFT) lyft stock\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) technically falls under the application software arena. However, it\u2019s best known as an on-demand ride-sharing specialist. Now, part of the problem was that Lyft has historically been overshadowed by its mainline rival Uber (NYSE:UBER). Whereas Uber has branched out to other businesses and other countries, Lyft has stayed in the tried-and-true ride-sharing business in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWith the expansionary trajectory of the tech ecosystem, choosing to be small carries risks. As such, I haven\u2019t exactly been the most supportive of LYFT stock. Neither have the analysts, who rate shares a consensus hold. Still, the average price target stands at $19.25, which implies not-insignificant room for growth.\n\nRecently, Lyft shared in its investor conference that gross bookings may increase at an annualized rate of 15%. If so, that may prove that the domestic ride-sharing industry is big enough for two major players.\n\nAnalysts are looking for revenue of $5.51 billion in fiscal 2024, implying 25.2% expansion. Given the recent vote of confidence, LYFT might be one of the contrarian stocks to consider.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) falls under the exploration and production (upstream) space of the hydrocarbon industry. Politically and ideologically, the shift toward renewable energy appears to make Occidental seem irrelevant. Therefore, it might be a risky idea among contrarian stocks. In other words, OXY has been fading because of a lack of demand, not because it\u2019s a hidden opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the ebb and flow of the hydrocarbon sector shouldn\u2019t detract us from geopolitical challenges. It remains true that many Western nations are dependent on fossil fuels, fuels which stem from jurisdictionally \u201cquestionable\u201d regions. Further, while tensions in the Middle East may have relatively quieted down, they can always ratchet up. If so, global supply chains could come under threat, cynically boosting upstream players\u2019 profitability.\n\nDespite the potential for robust upside, analysts rate OXY stock a consensus hold. However, it\u2019s interesting that the high-side target for earnings per share in fiscal 2024 is $5.39, up 46% from last year. Also, the blue-sky revenue target stands at $31.9 billion, up 10.3%. In my opinion, it\u2019s one of the contrarian stocks to consider.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB)\n\nAnother enterprise that I haven\u2019t been very supportive of is Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Falling under the travel services industry, Airbnb along with its subsidiaries operates a sharing-economy solution aimed at the lodging sector. By hosting a marketplace that connects hosts and guests, travelers can bypass the traditional hotel experience. At the same time, hosts can enjoy some extra scratch.\n\nTo be sure, Airbnb has encountered both headwinds tied to the Covid-19 disruption along with issues related to guest experiences. Without getting into the gory details, there\u2019s always a chance for problems to arise when you bring two strangers together. It can get especially problematic when dealing with peoples\u2019 homes. That\u2019s part of the reason why I myself was hesitant on ABNB.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not terribly surprising that analysts rate ABNB stock as a consensus hold. However, market research indicates that consumers are prioritizing travel and experiential expenditures. Given this reality, it\u2019s quite possible that Airbnb could rise higher.\n\nInterestingly, the consensus sales target calls for revenue of $11.17 billion in fiscal 2024. That\u2019s up 21.4% from the prior year, making ABNB one of the contrarian stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Undervalued stocks are those trading below their intrinsic value. That is when you should buy them. It\u2019s how you implement the buy low, sell high investment strategy.\n\nYet investors have trouble picking up shares of beaten-down stocks. If the market is running away from them it is difficult to run towards them. They think, maybe the crowd knows something I don\u2019t.\n\nPerhaps, but the trick is choosing good companies that are temporarily out of favor. As Warren Buffett said, \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the stock market regularly setting new all-time highs, you might think it\u2019s hard to find a bargain. Yet there are plenty of undervalued S&P 500 stocks that you can buy at a discount. For every Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) growing by leaps and bounds there are excellent businesses available to pick up cheap. The three stocks below are sitting 20% or more below their 52-week high. Because they off discounted valuations but are still expected to grow earnings, this is a great time to pick up shares.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signage. DLTR stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan Weiss\n\nDeep discount dollar store chain Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) should be thriving. The high-inflation economy that isn\u2019t growing jobs and sports meager wage increases ought to make its stores prime destinations for consumers, yet the retailer struggles.\n\nShares are down 20% in 2024 and slumped 26% from their 52-week high. It is caught between a rock and a hard place. If it remained a pure-play dollar store, it wouldn\u2019t be able to make ends meet itself. It operates on such thin margins that offering goods at $1 or $1.25 would leave it no room for profits.\n\nBoosting its price point to the $3 to $5 range has helped broaden the quality and selection of goods it offers but increases the discount retail competition it faces. It also just took it on the chin after announcing it was looking to sell its Family Dollar chain. It\u2019s possible it could spin the business off again too. It was a bad acquisition almost a decade ago and it hasn\u2019t improved since.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue increased 4% to $7.6 billion on a 1% increase in comparable sales with Dollar Tree comps up 1.7%. It reiterated its full-year outlook of $31 billion to $32 billion represents mid-single-digit revenue growth. Adjusted earnings of $6.50 to $7.00 per share are a 15% increase year-over-year at the midpoint.\n\nWith Dollar Tree stock trading at 14 times those expected earnings and at a fraction of sales, the deep discount retailer is one of the undervalued S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nSLB (SLB) slb stock\n\nSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Schlumberger, SLB (NYSE:SLB) is the world\u2019s largest oilfield services provider with over $33 billion in annual revenue. Shares are down 17% year-to-date but off 30% from recent highs. Concern about falling global demand for oil weighs on the stock, especially the recent announcement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies to gradually lift production cuts. The concerns are overblown.\n\nThe long-term forecast for oil remains strong, despite numerous countries wanting to go green and switch to wind and solar. There is simply not enough capacity available to meet demand for that to happen any time soon.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration expects demand to keep growing this year along with greater production. That will benefit SLB as it invests in new technology and digital solutions. Its investments in lower-carbon technologies and carbon capture and sequestration initiatives helped first-quarter revenue grow 13% to $8.7 billion.\n\nEarnings are expected to grow 21% for the next five years but SLB stock trades at a fraction to that rate. It also goes for a discounted 13 times the free cash flow it produces. At these levels, and with its forward-looking investments creating new value-added revenue streams SLB is an undervalued S&P 500 stock to buy.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) Expedia app logo on a smartphone screen. EXPE stock\n\nSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline travel agent Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) offers investors a good opportunity to get in on the beaten-down business just as it prepares to take flight. EXPE stock is down 23% this year and trades 28% lower than it did a year ago. But a turnaround is in the works.\n\nExpedia transitioned to a unified platform over the past few years, allowing its different brands to share and supply between them. It is also growing its presence internationally, and though Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) represents a formidable competitor to go up against, it should be able to single network advantage over time.\n\nLike many companies, Expedia seeks to exploit the vast spending data it collects to build out a new media network. With ad spending crossing $50 billion last year it should provide the online travel agency with supplemental revenue streams. That will add to its growth in emerging markets like China where it has a partnership with Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM) as well as in the vacation rental market. Its Vrbo unit\u00a0is the third-largest player behind Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Booking.\n\nDespite Expedia stock jumping 26% of its lows, it still trades at 8 times next year\u2019s earnings. EXPE is also trading at less than twice its sales. With EXPE stock also going for a rock-bottom 9 times FCF, this is a deeply discounted stock ready to run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "An Airbnb host in Durham, North Carolina, filed a complaint in court against renters-turned-squatters after they refused to vacate the property until they received an order of eviction, according to court documents.\n\nThe documents, obtained by Fox News Digital, show the current guests agreed to pay the host, Farzana Rahman, $1,900 per month from Oct. 25, 2023, to May 25, 2024, to stay in a condominium on Chimney Ridge in Durham.\n\nBut after May 25, the guests refused to leave the condominium.\n\nRahman told a local ABC station that her cleaning person went to the property and noticed the renters were still inside.\n\nAIRBNB PROFIT JUMPS, BOOKINGS SLOW AS COMPANY NUDGES HOSTS TO LOWER PRICES An Airbnb host who rented her property to the same guests for several months, filed a complaint to have them evicted after they refused to vacate the property at the end of their agreement.\n\n\"They answered the door, and they said, 'No, we haven't moved out.' She (the cleaner) said, 'Should I come tomorrow?' And they said, 'No, don't come back,'\" Rahman said.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIn court documents, Rahman said she contacted the Durham Police Department on May 28, which resulted in two officers being dispatched to the rental property.\n\nThe officers reportedly spoke with a man at the property \u2013 who was not the primary renter or named in the complaint \u2013 who said he would not leave.\n\nAIRBNB AND VRBO HOSTS UNDER NEW RESTRICTIONS AS SHORT-TERM RENTAL RULES KICK OFF IN NYC\n\nAirbnb, Rahman said, would not provide information about the guests to the owner, and the company instructed her to file a complaint with the local authorities to force the guests to vacate.\n\nRahman also noted that she had not been able to enter her property to assess the damages, though standing in the entryway, she reported a strong odor of tobacco and marijuana from inside.\n\nThe situation has affected Rahman\u2019s ability to host future guests, she said in the filing.\n\n\"I demand to be put in possession of the premises and to recover the total amount listed above and daily rental until entry of judgment plus interest and reimbursement for court costs,\" she wrote.\n\nAIRBNB BANS USE OF ALL INDOOR SECURITY CAMERAS An Airbnb host in Durham, North Carolina, filed a complaint to have guests evicted from a property after they refused to leave when the agreement expired last month.\n\nThe station reported that Rahman is a single parent.\n\nShe told the station the occupants are refusing to leave until they receive an eviction order.\n\n\"I think they\u2019re just trying to gain time to stay there for free because they haven\u2019t paid,\" Rahman said.\n\nAirbnb did not immediately respond to requests from FOX Business for comment on the matter.\n\nAIRBNB REPLICATES HOUSE FROM DISNEY'S \u2018UP\u2019 THAT ACTUALLY FLOATS\n\nThe company\u2019s site warns those looking to rent their properties through them that guests who stay in a home or apartment for a month or longer could establish rights as a tenant.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn some jurisdictions, those rights mean that local tenancy laws could protect them from being removed unless a required eviction process goes through the court system.\n\nWhen guests refuse to leave, Airbnb said, \"These situations are incredibly rare, but if they happen, we\u2019ll work with you to try and help resolve the problem with your guest.\"\n\nThe company also suggests owners consider utilizing a rental agreement signed by the guests, which sets the requirements and rules of the house in a formal document signed when the rental is booked. The agreements, though, could be governed differently depending on where the property owner is located, so they are encouraged to check local laws first.\n\n\"Statutes exist in nearly all jurisdictions that permit landlords to use summary proceedings to evict tenants. A summary proceeding is a judicial proceeding that lets a landlord regain possession of leased property in an expedited fashion,\" the site reads. \"You should contact a landlord-tenant attorney or your local county courts to learn more about eviction laws where you live, as they may affect your ability to evict a guest who overstays a monthly stay.\"\n\nOriginal article source:Airbnb renters-turned-squatters refuse to vacate property unless evicted: court docs\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Return Trends At Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) Look Promising",
        "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Airbnb's (NASDAQ:ABNB) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Airbnb is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.16 = US$1.6b \u00f7 (US$25b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Airbnb has an ROCE of 16%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Hospitality industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Airbnb  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Airbnb's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Airbnb  for free.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWe're delighted to see that Airbnb is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. About five years ago the company was generating losses but things have turned around because it's now earning 16% on its capital. And unsurprisingly, like most companies trying to break into the black, Airbnb is utilizing 255% more capital than it was five years ago. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nAnother thing to note, Airbnb has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 58%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nOverall, Airbnb gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. And given the stock has remained rather flat over the last three years, there might be an opportunity here if other metrics are strong. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for ABNB  that compares the share price and estimated value.\n\nWhile Airbnb may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "content": "In this article, we are going to discuss the best place to visit in USA before you die. If you also want to check out other must-see destinations in America, here is our full list of the 40 Best Places to Visit in USA Before You Die.\n\nTourism Industry in the United States:\n\nAccording to a recent report by Euromonitor International, the U.S. travel industry was worth $1.2 trillion in 2023. The country welcomed 67 million international visitors last year \u2013 3rd most in the world, right after Spain and France \u2013 but this was only 84% of the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.\n\nThe report ranks the United States 17th out of 18 major international destinations, a worrying sign for the country\u2019s travel industry. Some of the problems faced by the American tourism sector include a lack of attention from the government leadership, safety concerns, strict visa policies, lengthy waiting times for visa interviews, and outdated technology at points of entry etc.\n\nAlmost 15 million Americans work in tourism and hospitality, making it the fifth-largest industry in the country.\n\nThe Need for Sustainable Tourism:\n\nAlthough the tourism industry comes as a boon for many and supports millions of businesses and jobs worldwide, it often doesn\u2019t come without a price. An example of this is the listing and rental of local homes on the online platform of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), which in many cities around the world has created a shortage of available residences for the locals, leading to insufficient housing and a massive increase in rents.\n\nThe city of New York is a popular market for Airbnb\u2019s short-term rentals, which contributed $85 million to the local economy in 2022 alone. However, the city administration argues that the proliferation of short-term rentals through Airbnb and other platforms has pushed up rents and helped NYC\u2019s housing shortage. As a result, the city adopted the Short-Term Rental Registration Law, strictly restricting short-term and vacation rentals like those listed on platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. The law, which came into force in September 2023, requires all short-term rental hosts to register with the mayor's office. Moreover, it only allows a maximum of two guests at a time and requires the hosts to be physically present during the guests' stay.\n\nThis bold move by one of the Most Visited Cities in the World is now being closely monitored by other tourism hotspots. If America\u2019s biggest city can fix the problem of short-term rentals, others may follow. Meanwhile, Airbnb responded strongly to the new rules by calling them a \u2018de facto ban\u2019 on the platform and also sued NYC, but to no avail. At the same time, other critics believe that the city is bending to the lobbying of the hotel industry and locking out cheaper options for visitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite the setback, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) had a strong start to 2024, with the company reporting a revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 18% from the same quarter last year. Q1 net income also grew to $264 million, making it their most profitable quarter ever. Shares of ABNB were held by 56 hedge funds at the end of Q1 2024 in the IM database, with a collective stake value of around $2.5 billion. The stock has also witnessed an increase of 8.75% in price so far this year.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is included among the 12 Best Gig Economy Stocks to Buy.\n\nLargest Travel Company in the World:\n\nWith a market cap of over $127 billion as of the writing of this piece, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) holds the title of being the Largest Travel Company in the World. Operating in 228 countries and 40 different languages, there are more than 28 million global listings available between hotels, homes, and apartments under the Booking travel sites.\n\nThe Connecticut-based travel technology company also strongly felt the shocks of the pandemic when its revenue fell by almost 55%, from $15.06 billion in 2019, to $6.8 billion in 2020. However, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) bounced back strongly and boasted a revenue of over $21.36 billion in 2023 after the revival of international tourism, even higher than its pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe world leader in online travel seems to be having an even better 2024, with a Q1 revenue of $4.4 billion, an increase of 17% from the prior year quarter. Net income also increased massively by 192% to reach $776 million. The stock of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was held by 97 hedge funds at the end of Q1 2024 in the Insider Monkey database, with Fisher Asset Management holding the largest stake of 391,421 shares, valued at $1.42 billion.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we have referred to a number of sources such as Lonely Planet, Travel + Leisure, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, Reddit etc, looking for the Most Beautiful Places to Visit in America.

        "title": "Airbnb (ABNB) Down 0% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB). Shares have lost about 0% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Airbnb due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nAirbnb Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Increase Y/Y\n\nAirbnb reported adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share for first-quarter 2024, which jumped from 18 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 78.3%.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $2.14 billion increased 18% on a reported basis, as well as on an FX-neutral basis, year over year. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%.\r\n\r\nThe year-over-year increase was driven by continued strength in travel demand and the timing of the Easter holiday. Continuous improvement in Nights and Experiences Booked acted as a tailwind.\r\n\r\nGrowing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum across non-urban areas and increased demand for urban and cross-border travel, remained positive. A modest increase in Average Daily Rate was a plus.\r\n\r\nThese factors aided growth in the company\u2019s Gross Booking Value (GBV) in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, a solid momentum in Airbnb app downloads contributed well.\n\nQuarterly Details\n\nNights and Experiences Booked were 132.6 million, up 9.5% on a year-over-year basis. The metric was driven by strong performances in all regions, especially the Asia Pacific and Latin America.\r\n\r\nGBV amounted to $22.9 billion, which rose 12% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nGBV per Nights and Experiences Booked (or Average Daily Rates) were $172.88, which grew 3% on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of trip length, the category of long-term stays of 28 days or more accounted for 17% of overall gross nights booked.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, gross nights booked in non-urban areas grew 10% on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nCross-border nights booked was up 10% year over year and accounted for 46% of total gross nights booked.\n\nOperating Results\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $424 million, up 62% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nOperations and support costs, product development expenses, and sales and marketing expenses were $285 million, $475 million and $514 billion, increasing 1.1%, 13.1% and 14.2%, respectively, year over year. General and administrative expenses were $287 million, up 18.1% year over year.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter, Airbnb reported an operating income of $101 million against the operating loss of $5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to $11.1 billion compared with $10.1 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nLong-term debt, as of Mar 31, 2024, was $1.992 billion compared with $1.991 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion for the first quarter of 2024, significantly up from $63 million in the previous quarter.\r\n\r\nAirbnb generated a free cash flow of $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, the company expects revenues between $2.68 billion and $2.74 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 8-10% on a reported basis.\r\n\r\nAirbnb expects revenues to benefit from robust travel demand. However, the company expects revenue growth to face a significant sequential headwind due to the timing of the Easter holiday and the impact of forex rate changes.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decrease year over year.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, the company expects an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 35%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Airbnb has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Airbnb has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Airbnb\u2019s CEO Brian Chesky pairs people up to combat workplace loneliness: \u2018Sometimes it\u2019s just hard for one person to be a unicorn\u2019",
        "content": "Staffers at Airbnb might have found themselves in an unofficial work pairing courtesy of a practice adopted by the company's CEO, Brian Chesky.\n\nChesky, who co-founded the short-term accommodation site in 2008, recently said he has an \"informal\" habit of pairing people on his team to provide them with another layer of support.\n\nSpeaking on the 'ReThinking with Adam Grant' podcast recently Chesky, who is worth $11.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index, said he will often mold duos out of his new hires.\n\n\"Four years ago we hired two creative directors, they worked together as a duo. One's more of a creative director and one's more of a writer,\" he explained.\n\n\"They wanted to join together: I remember him saying: 'Well, if he joins, I'll probably join.' And they came together and they came as a set.\"\n\nWhile this working arrangement is common in creative advertising, the concept of a working duo made a mark on Chesky.\n\n\"It worked so well that I started thinking about this notion of duos in other areas ... sometimes it's just hard for one person to be a unicorn, to be able to do everything, but if you could create duos they could cover each other's strengths.\"\n\nChesky, who is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, was asked the question in relation to combatting workplace loneliness.\n\nWhile Chesky's practice arose organically, he agreed the tactic could go a long way to helping solve the problem.\n\nAccording to a November study of more than 2,000 employees from analytics company Perceptyx, more than four in ten employees reported feeling lonely at work.\n\nMen were twice as likely as women to say they felt very lonely, with senior leaders also reporting to feel more chronically isolated than managers lower down the hierarchy.\n\nPerceptyx found that the impact ranged from disengagement to a fall in productivity\u2014lonely workers were 4.5 times more likely to struggle with their output and rely on unhealthy coping mechanisms to get through.\n\nLoneliness isn't just hurting individuals, it's also damaging economies.\n\nCigna healthcare's Loneliness Index estimates that employers lose $154 billion a year due to absenteeism, a figure that could be improved upon if everyone from trainees to the C-suite felt they had someone to lean on.\n\nChesky added he had \"never really thought about\" how this organic habit could help combat the problem of isolation in the workplace, but added: \"I think there's something to that.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"And also I think people are on the same journey as you because you're a new employee and you're [trying] to integrate [into] the team, but you're new and you're the odd person out. And so giving people a shared journey to be on together I think is really important.\"\n\nWork duo, not siblings\n\nWhile Chesky, who has grown the platform to host more than 1.5 billion guests in its history, previously referred to his employees as \"family\" he has since walked back that sentiment.\n\nChesky laid off a quarter of Airbnb's headcount\u2014around 1,900 people\u2014in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nWhile announcing the layoffs, Chesky wrote he had a \"deep feeling of love\" for all of his staff, which may have rung as something of an oxymoron for those losing their roles.\n\nThe CEO of the Fortune500 company has shifted his narrative within the company from familial relationships to close professional bonds.\n\nHe explained: \"I wrote that letter fairly quickly. I didn't have a lot of time, and so I wrote what I felt and that's what I felt, and I was pretty emotional when I was writing it. And it is true that a company's not a family ... you don't fire members of your family.\n\n\"I write what I feel and I felt this sense of protecting people, even people that were leaving, that they weren't totally leaving Airbnb in every sense of the word. I mean, they were leaving with equity, they were leaving with everything on their resume\u2014we created an alumni network.\n\n\"We have a very robust alumni network, which is very unusual for a company. There's a bond that's extremely deep.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -7.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Content industry, which Airbnb falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Airbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, indicating a change of -7.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.67 points to a change of -35.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +7.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.38 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Airbnb.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ABNB _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate of $2.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.3%. The $11.24 billion and $12.56 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.4% and +11.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $0.41 for the same period compares with $0.18 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.66%. The EPS surprise was +78.26%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Travel Stocks to Buy to Book Some Serious Gains",
        "content": "The travel industry is booming, and Memorial Day weekend\u00a0was proof\u00a0that Americans are ready to pack their bags and fly away! Travel stocks are ready to rally, and companies have rebounded after the slow pandemic period. Now is the time to consider buying travel stocks. Travel agency AAA forecasted 43.8 million people traveling at least 50 miles for the Memorial Day weekend, up from 38 million in 2019.\n\nThis\u00a0highlights the rebound in travel this year, and I believe it will continue throughout 2024.\u00a0Earlier, a\u00a0survey showed that 82% of\u00a0Americans planned to travel this year, and among\u00a0them, 42% planned to take multiple trips.\u00a0With travel spending set to increase this year, now is\u00a0a great\u00a0time for investors to buy travel stocks for serious gains.\u00a0\u00a0Several\u00a0other companies will benefit from the travel boom, from the airlines to hotels. With that in mind, let\u2019s\u00a0take a\u00a0look at the three travel stocks to buy.\n\nTravel Stocks To Buy: Airbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nTrading at $146 and up 8% year-to-date, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a steal at the current price. While it is up 8% since Jan, it has lost most of its value in the past month. With the unleashing of pent-up travel demand, Airbnb is the first to benefit. Giving stiff competition to hotels, Airbnb runs an asset-light model that finds success as the travel industry picks up.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt beat expectations in the first quarter and reported a revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and the EPS came in at 41 cents.\u00a0The profit soared 126% YOY, which was the\u00a0company\u2019s best first quarter ever.\u00a0The company saw a 12% YOY jump in gross bookings, which\u00a0stood\u00a0at $22.90 billion. Despite the\u00a0strong numbers, investors weren\u2019t happy with the guidance, leading to a stock drop.\n\nAirbnb reported an impressive first quarter\u00a0despite not being a traditional holiday period, which means the ongoing and upcoming quarters could be even better due to the Memorial Day weekend and the forthcoming summer holidays. Its numbers are a testament to the company\u2019s growth and its soaring popularity amongst travelers.\u00a0This\u00a0is one of the best travel stocks to own before the holiday\u00a0period\u00a0begins.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the stock\u2019s future,\u00a0and\u00a0many have recently raised the price target.\u00a0Strong\u00a0revenue and earnings growth will drive ABNB stock higher.\n\nDelta Airlines (DAL) Delta (DAL) Airplanes sit in a row at Kansas City International Airport\n\nSource: David Peterlin / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited States-based Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has already benefitted from the pent-up travel demand, and its numbers show that it is one of the best airlines today. It has an extensive domestic route and\u00a0also\u00a0offers international services to East Asia, Western Europe, and Latin America.\n\nThe company beat expectations in the\u00a0first-quarter results. Its operating revenue came in at $12.6 billion, up 6% YOY, and the earnings per share stood at $0.45.\u00a0For the second quarter, it is aiming for growth in the range of\u00a05% to 7%\u00a0compared to the prior year, with\u00a0an EPS of $2.20 to $2.50.\u00a0It saw a strong demand for leisure and business travel\u00a0bookings.\n\nDelta swung from a loss in the first quarter of 2023 to a profit this year and has set a strong momentum for the second half\u00a0of the year. With summer approaching, Delta\u00a0is set\u00a0to have better days ahead. Despite inflation, people are willing to spend on travel, and the Memorial Day weekend numbers\u00a0are proof\u00a0that summer will be busy for travel companies.\n\nTrading at $50,\u00a0Delta stock looks undervalued to me\u00a0at the current level.\u00a0While it is up 25% YTD, there is still a long way to go. It is close to the 52-week high of $53 but can keep soaring higher over the coming months. Delta also enjoys a modest dividend yield of 0.79%, making it attractive for passive income investors.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) The front of a Marriott (MAR) building featuring the company name and logo.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nA global giant and one of the most well-established hospitality companies, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR)\u00a0is set to capitalize on the upcoming peak travel demand. The numbers have shown solid growth, with\u00a0a 4.3% rise in global revenue per room and a 4% jump in the average daily rate. While it slightly missed EPS expectations, it\u00a0\u00a0beat revenue expectations with $5.98 billion in revenue for the first quarter.\n\nMarriott\u2019s strength lies in its successful global operations. It is steadily expanding and has added 46,000 rooms to end the quarter with 1.6 million rooms. It has also committed to grow its European presence and wants to add 100 properties and 12,000 rooms by 2026. Management also rewards shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nThe company is financially strong enough to achieve the expansion goals without compromising\u00a0on the\u00a0dividends. It raised the quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.63 per share.\u00a0Trading at $228, the stock is up 2% YTD and 28% in the past 12 months. MAR stock is a slow and steady mover with a dividend yield of 1.10%.\n\nDriven by strong results, the management raised the outlook and aims for an adjusted EPS between $9.31 and $9.65 for the\u00a0full\u00a0year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 2",
        "content": "Investing.com - The quarterly earnings season has largely ended, and Goldman Sachs has taken this opportunity to revisit its top 10 investing themes for 2024, and the stocks in focus in conjunction with these themes. The first five topics can be seen here, and these are the final five themes:\n\nCloud computing return to normal\n\nInvestors have been gaining greater confidence in the ability of certain headwinds to cloud revenue growth over the past 12-18 months normalizing, and thus attention for 2024/2025 is shifting to trying to gain a better understanding of how building momentum in artificial intelligence workloads & AI related services could contribute to growth and margins going forward.\n\n\u201cWe still see the long-term adoption of cloud computing services by enterprise customers as a secular theme due to broad-based increases of digital spending and shifts in IT budgets toward cloud adoption,\u201d said analysts at Goldman, in a note dated May 17.\n\nWith meaningful revenue backlog, we see the broader public cloud landscape evolving from simply being a conversation around cost savings/efficiency to being an essential piece of driving growth for customers through utilization of AI-related offerings, operationally/industry specific solutions & partner integrations, all of which have a goal of improving the extraction & utilization of data to drive business outcomes while keeping that data secure.\n\nIn addition, companies have expressed optimism that AI workloads could build in momentum as a tailwind for 2024 & beyond.\n\nGoldman sees the tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the most exposed to this potential upside.\n\nNormalization of online travel demand\n\nThe multi-year period of abnormal travel growth, caused by COVID and then the associated pent-up demand, is coming to an end, and Goldman sees structural growth for the online travel industry returning to pre-COVID levels in the high-single-digit/low-double-digit percentage range.\n\nAs growth normalizes, online travel agencies are increasingly focused on a number of initiatives to drive brand loyalty, less reliance on performance advertising, including investing in loyalty programs and merchandising/discounts direct to consumers.\n\n\u201cWe believe generative AI has the potential to reshape the online travel funnel and how companies approach customer acquisition & conversion,\u201d said analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cwe are witnessing a greater focus on capital returns with online travel companies increasingly buying back stock (or announcing shareholder return authorizations that have surprised to the upside).\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stocks most exposed to these themes include Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).\n\nEvolution of interactive entertainment\n\nThe bank sees the potential rise of a hybrid distribution model of mobile/cloud as well as the potential emergence of VR/AR [virtual reality/augmented reality] physical equipment as the next generation of distribution and interfaces, albeit while acknowledging the inherent technological challenges limiting pace of adoption.\n\nThe other distribution mode that we will continue to monitor is whether any industry participant is able to successfully build enough scale of content to capitalize on the subscription-ification of the consumer Internet.\n\nWith consumers increasingly shifting consumption habits to short-form video and gaming, we have seen companies focus on a few themes in an effort to capitalize on evolving consumer behavior: The addition of new verticals by large scaled platforms (e.g., Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) expanding into gaming, and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) expanding into audiobooks & podcasts); expanding distribution channels and touchpoints (e.g., Take-Two's (NASDAQ:TTWO) partnership with Netflix on Grand Theft Auto mobile games); the emergence of cloud gaming; and the extension of key intellectual property (e.g., Netflix TV series around Take-Two/Ubisoft franchises).\n\n\u201cLooking longer-term, we expect large-scaled platforms to be the best positioned to capitalize on the aforementioned trends given the scale of consumers which provides greater leverage on fixed content costs, the breadth and depth of content library providing abundance of consumer choice, and rising pricing power as more value is delivered to consumers,\u201d said Goldman Sachs.\n\nShifting industry momentum\n\nLooking to the remainder of the year, the bank sees Internet companies focused on the following themes: executing against a more normalized revenue backdrop; mixed margin outlooks; and a renewed commitment to shareholder returns, with several companies announcing new buyback authorizations and/or dividends.\n\nA key debate for investors will be how online penetration rates continue to evolve from these higher levels and how this translates back into the remaining secular growth runway of companies within these verticals.\n\nThe maturation of end markets is contributing to a step-up in competitive intensity, with companies increasingly focused on a mixture of demand/supply incentives and the launch of new products/adjacencies to help sustain revenue growth, broaden platform offerings, and deepen customer relationships.\n\nAdditionally, companies are earmarking an increasing amount of capital towards shareholder returns, with the sector returning $111 billion in 2023 (99% through buybacks) and with nearly $200 billion in remaining buyback authorization still waiting to be deployed.\n\n\u201cWe expect companies to continue to use shareholder returns in the years ahead, with this likely to support a continued broadening of their investor base,\u201d Goldman added.\n\nRegulatory matters and business practices\n\nThe rise of government and regulators\u2019 focus on the business practices of the industry\u2019s scaled players has been a persistent theme in recent years, said analysts at the investment bank, seeing three potential areas of risk.\n\nThe bank cited \u201cheadline noise\u201d if investigations, fines and new rules proliferate; rising costs to comply with an array of global initiatives; and headwinds to any in-market consolidation or strategic M&A by large players, causing the industry to lean back on internal product R&D.\n\nOver the short/medium term, the regulatory focus on antitrust issues continues to be the biggest area of uncertainty, citing the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against Google; the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Amazon; and the U.S. DOJ lawsuit against Google as well as the European Commission statement of objections against Google.\n\nSuch scrutiny of the largest companies is likely to persist, \u201cand we expect that investors will remain acutely focused on \u2018headline risk\u2019 and watch for new developments.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the increased number of antitrust-related regulatory developments in recent months/years has created an increased degree of uncertainty and volatility around potential long-term business structure and market share dynamics, particularly if it results in \u201cstructural\u201d remedies being enforced.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 2\n\nHotel executives set sights on empty office buildings as supply lags demand\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule is launched from Florida on first crewed space flight\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Airbnb fair value estimate is US$257 Airbnb is estimated to be 43% undervalued based on current share price of US$146 The US$153 analyst price target for ABNB is 40% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$4.39b US$4.71b US$5.87b US$6.87b US$8.02b US$8.87b US$9.59b US$10.2b US$10.7b US$11.2b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x10 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 10.62% Est @ 8.15% Est @ 6.42% Est @ 5.21% Est @ 4.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4%  US$4.1k US$4.1k US$4.7k US$5.2k US$5.6k US$5.8k US$5.8k US$5.8k US$5.6k US$5.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$11b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.4%) = US$227b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$227b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$111b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$163b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$146, the company appears quite good value at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Airbnb as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.098. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Airbnb\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for ABNB.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "title": "Airbnb CEO reflects on fumbled messaging during layoffs: \u2018You don\u2019t fire members of your family\u2019",
        "content": "Saying I love you at the wrong time can be damaging, or at the very least awkward\u2014conjuring up memories of calling your teacher Mom. And there\u2019s no worse time to blurt feelings for someone than when you\u2019re telling them they\u2019re out of a job, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky learned.\n\n\u201cI have a deep feeling of love for all of you,\u201d he wrote in 2020 to laid-off workers. Responding to travel restrictions, the vacation rental company let go of 1,900 employees, almost a quarter of its workforce.\n\nSpeaking this past May on Adam Grant\u2019s podcast ReThinking, Chesky found that hindsight was 20/20 in terms of how he spoke to ex-employees. While layoffs are never considered a good thing, some praised Chesky for striving to be empathetic in his language and providing a generous severance package that included a year\u2019s worth of health insurance. But looking back, Chesky admits he fumbled a bit while trying to get his message across.\n\n\u201cThe reason I used the word love is 'cause that's what I felt at the time,\u201d he says. Though he adds that he was under some pressure, \u201cI wrote that letter fairly quickly. I didn't have a lot of time, and so I wrote what I felt and that's what I felt, and I was pretty emotional when I was writing it.\u201d He claims to have reviewed, at the time, the name of each employee being let go, and adds that while he didn\u2019t know everyone leaving, he wanted them to be aware that it was a long-term and thorough choice.\n\nEven so, Chesky\u2019s attempt to harness feelings of familial compassion didn\u2019t really ring true during the trying period at Airbnb. Company culture was foundational to the messaging, as AirBnb\u2019s emphasized a sense of collaboration a la many millennial startups. But 2020 challenged that undertaking, and in part exposed what Airbnb really is, a business\u2014not a family.\n\n\u201cHow does a company whose mission is centered around belonging have to tell thousands of people they can\u2019t be at the company anymore?\u201d he said in a podcast that year. \u201cIt was a very, very difficult thing to face.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, Chesky had to admit he wasn\u2019t running a family, or if it was a family it would be a dysfunctional one. \u201cIt is true that a company is not a family. In fact, we had to make that pivot,\u201d he explained this May. \u201cWe used to refer to ourselves as a family, and then we did have to fire people or they'd have to leave the company and yeah, you don't fire members of your family,\u201d he continued.\n\nIndeed, the movement to call your company a family has recently come under fire. It\u2019s become a cliche for toxic workplaces or more of a red flag, as an Harvard Business Review blog post from leadership expert Joshua A. Luna, points out. He explains that executives who use such mottos are at risk of ignoring the hierarchies at play, blurring work-life balance, and overemphasizing values like loyalty.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Chesky has since backed away from his family-based culture, he stands by the sentiment to some degree\u2014making business relationships less frosty. He wanted to communicate a sense of protection to those who left, providing them with vested equity as well as what he claims to be a strong network.\n\nTrust is integral to good teams, says Chesky, and while the company might not be brothers and sisters, \u201cthere can be a bond that can be deeper than a typical work contract.\u201d Part of what led to his layoffs love letter was a feeling that other companies were being disrespectful as they sent out very formal notices.\n\n\u201cIt's pretty inhumane. It seems like a human being didn't write it. It feels like an AI prompt or something,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cAI is more compassionate than most of these layoff letters, and I think what ends up happening is that the CEOs get very risk averse.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As the travel industry rebounds from the pandemic lows, now is a great time to consider the best travel stocks to buy. The sector\u2019s resilience and pent-up demand for leisure and business travel positions it for strong growth in the coming years.\n\nFactors such as increased consumer spending on experiences and the reassurance of international tourism drive momentum. Additionally, integrating immersive experiences continues to entice the Millennial and Gen Z segments. While the travel industry\u2019s landscape is vast, it can be highly cyclical and be more appealing to traders. However, there exists a unique class of travel stocks that could double their stock values by 2028.\n\nHere are the three best travel stocks to snap up for 2X gains by 2028!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), the trailblazing online marketplace for lodging and travel experiences, has disrupted the hospitality industry. While it had been a pandemic darling, the company has continued its momentum after reporting GAAP profitability in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAirbnb is a unique business that has disrupted the hospitality and traditional hotel industry. It has empowered its users and hosts to make the most of what the world offers. The company\u2019s asset-light business model, which relies on hosts rather than owning properties, offers scalability and significant cost advantages. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 18% YOY to $9.92 billion. Net income skyrocketed 153% YOY to $4.79 billion, with active listings exceeding 7.7 million. Its unique offerings and more personalized experiences drive the platform\u2019s growth, and the company embraces AI to further streamline the customer experience. Moreover, ABNB stock had the most profitable Q1 earnings in its history. This makes Airbnb one of the best travel stocks for a shot at doubling your money through 2028.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) The front of a Marriott (MAR) building featuring the company name and logo.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) presents a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the travel boom. The company boasts a vast portfolio of renowned brands, including Ritz-Carlton, Marriott, Sheraton, and Westin.\n\nMarriott has several positive tailwinds going for the business in 2024. While the travel industry faced a slump during the pandemic, Marriott\u2019s business came roaring back. The company has reported record revenue and earnings despite inflation and higher interest rates. This growth might not slow down soon, as the UN tourism forecasts international tourism to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, many experts expect business travel to exceed 2019 levels as fears of higher inflation and recession continue to subside. Ultimately, this is fantastic news for Marriott as it bets on the rebound in international tourism. With the company raising its FY24 earnings guidance, travel stock enthusiasts might consider its long-term potential beyond 2024.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the leading travel juggernaut, operating a suite of popular travel booking platforms, including Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, and Kayak. This diversified platform provides a diversified platform for all travel-related needs.\n\nThe company\u2019s comprehensive platform allows travelers to book flights, hotels, rental cars, and other travel services. Over the last decade, its extensive global reach and strong brand recognition have bolstered its appeal. Moreover, its user-friendly interfaces and focus on mobile bookings have propelled its dominance in the online travel booking market.\n\nIn FY23, revenue increased 25% YOY to a record $21.37 billion. Gross travel bookings increased 24% from the year prior, and the company\u2019s platform booked a record of more than 1 billion rooms. Most notably, profitability is accelerating at a fast rate. This is further exemplified in the first quarter of 2024, with earnings per share (EPS) up 220% to $22.37 per share. With its dominance, diverse offerings, and skyrocketing gross booking volume, BKNG stock remains a staple in the travel and leisure industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the hilliest town in the US. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 20 Hilliest Cities and Towns in the US.\n\nThe United States is one of the world\u2019s largest countries with a land area of nearly 9,826,630 km sq, making up 6.1% of the world\u2019s land mass. Calculating the exact amount of area occupied by hilly areas in the US is challenging, but a considerable portion of the US is classified as hilly or mountainous. This includes mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, Appalachian Mountains, Cascade Range, and the Coastal Range. There are 18 hilly states in the US out of which Colorado has the highest elevation.\n\nAround 2 million Americans shifted from urban areas to suburbs between 2020 and 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced this trend, prompting many people to leave large urban cities for suburban and hilly areas. This increased demand for housing in hilly regions contributed to rising property prices. The Colorado Association of Realtors reported the greatest 12-month period price increase, up by 21.3%, in Denver homes in October 2020. However, the rising property prices led to a decrease in overall sales in the years following the pandemic. Colorado, for example, saw a 20-30% decrease in sales in 2023.\n\nKey Industries in the Hilly Regions of the US\n\nTourism, Agriculture, and Information and Technology are some of the key industries in the hilly regions of the US. The technology sector, in particular, has been booming in the hilly areas. For example, the tech industry significantly impacts Colorado\u2019s economy, contributing $76 billion to the Gross State Product in 2021, making up 18% of the state\u2019s total economic output.\n\nTourism is another major industry that impacts businesses in hilly areas. In the year 2022, the GDP contribution of the travel and tourism sector in the US amounted to $2.02 trillion. Like other countries, the US also relies heavily on its hilly cities and towns to boost its tourism. Some of the leading tourism companies operating in the industry include Vail Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:MTN), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH).\n\nVail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) is one of the largest and most renowned publicly traded tourism companies, primarily known for its premier ski resorts and mountain destinations. In Q2 2024, Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) reported an 8% YoY increase in EBITDA. Meanwhile, EBITDA margin improved by 3.3 points in Q2 compared to the same period last year, due to effective cost management.\n\nStory continues\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) operates as a hotel and resort chain. The company generates most of its revenue by selling vacation ownership interests to individuals, providing them with the right to use a resort property for a specific period each year. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) offers an annual dividend yield of 2.14% as of May 31.\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), founded in 2007 is another significant player in the travel and tourism industry. The company\u2019s annual revenue generation for 2023 was $9.917 billion, an 18.07% increase from 2022.\n\nHere's what Polen Capital said about Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we initiated new positions in Sage Group and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and added to our existing position in Globant. Airbnb is a great business model, according to our research, due to its two-sided global network effects. For several reasons, Airbnb has a better mousetrap with its supply growth engine, with its hosts having a far lower cost of capital and more flexibility than hotels. We think private rentals should continue to grow their share of overall accommodation stays, potentially up to 30% of lodging or higher over the long term, letting the private rental gross booking value grow at a low double-digit rate. We also think Airbnb should continue to gain share within the private rental market as its global network effects strengthen, allowing for mid-teens revenue growth. With flat to rising margins over time, significant free cash flow generation, and a management team that has demonstrated its owner orientation, this should result in high-teens EPS growth over time. While the path there will not be linear, and it is a more discretionary spending-tied business, we think the long-term secular growth opportunity is very compelling.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe compiled a list of the 20 hilliest cities and towns in the US by gathering elevation data from various sources like DBPedia, KDVR, and City Data. We have used the most recent data available up to October 2023. Furthermore, we have excluded villages, ensuring that our list only features only towns and cities. The list of the 20 hilliest towns and cities in the US has been arranged in ascending order of their elevation level.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Hilliest Town in the US\n\n1. Alma, Colorado\n\nElevation: 10,353 ft\n\nAlma is in the first position on our list of hilliest cities and towns in the US. Alma is situated at an elevation of 10,353 ft, making it the highest-elevation town in North America. Despite its size, Alma offers many adventures for visitors. Nearby attractions include Breckenridge Ski Resort, Pike National Forest, Boreas Pass, and Mosquito Pass. The pleasant summer temperatures make it a perfect escape from the populated urban cities.\n\nTo check out more such towns and places, visit 20 Hilliest Cities and Towns in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the hilliest cities and towns in the US to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the most loved country in Asia. We have created a list of the most revered countries in the continent, for the full free list, visit 20 Most Loved Countries in Asia.\n\nEach country offers a unique experience. However, there are some countries that you just love, whether it is because of their architecture, landscape, culture, and cuisine, or due to the experiences you have with locals in those countries. Quite often, an important determinant is also the economic opportunities you get offered there. All of these factors combine to have a long-lasting impact on your perception of those countries.\n\nAsia is the fastest growing continent in the world, and by 2040, it is projected to represent more than\u00a050% of the world\u2019s GDP. The region offers immense potential, which has resulted in a mass inflow of job seekers, remote workers, and investors to the continent with an eye on tapping in on the lucrative opportunities offered by Asia. Besides that, the region\u2019s tourism reputation has also enhanced over the last couple of decades, due to its warmer climates, unique landscapes, and diverse cultures.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is one example of that. The Dubai Mall, a shopping mall in Dubai, was recently declared as the most visited place on Earth, as it welcomed over 105 million visitors in 2023. Millions of tourists travel to the country every year to get a feel of the UAE\u2019s vibrant life marked by its glitzy hotels and stunning architecture. There has also been an increase in the number of people from developed countries of Europe and North America moving to the UAE for improved lifestyles, lower taxes, and higher income.\n\nSeveral large international corporations maintain presence in the UAE and contribute toward the country\u2019s success. This includes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) which is hopeful of adding a whopping $39 billion to the Emirati economy between 2022 and 2026 through its cloud portfolio, which is likely to create 100,000 jobs as well. The American technology giant is also negotiating with officials in the UAE over the potential use of its cloud-based services in government sectors. Besides that, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans on investing another $3.4 billion in the coming years to support data centers and local businesses across the country.\n\nAs more and more people shift to the UAE, the real estate business is also booming in the country. A recent\u00a0study held in the UK declared Dubai as the most profitable city in the world for landlords that place their properties on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). The study noted that house owners were charging over $1,000 per night in some properties that were located closer to the Burj Khalifa. The research highlighted that owners who place their properties on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in Dubai were expected to breakeven and recover their money after 121 nights of their property being rented out. Another Asian city that made to the list of the profitable cities for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) business was Vietnam\u2019s capital, Hanoi.\n\nStory continues\n\nTurkiye is another top destination for tourists, where the number of travelers in 2023 jumped 10.4% compared to the previous year, to total 50 million. The figure is likely to further grow as Ankara this year relaxed travel requirements for tourists from the US, Canada, and Mexico by eliminating the need for them to obtain an e-visa if their visit was shorter than 90 days. Turkiye\u2019s growing appeal as a tourist destination has led to a boom in its hospitality industry, with renowned hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) further expanding their presence in the country.\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) recently added the Ramada by Wyndham Karapinar and Days Hotel by Wyndham Istanbul Esenyurt to its list of hotels in Turkiye. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH), which is the largest hotel company operating in the country, has over 100 active hotels, and another 20 under development in Turkiye.\n\nOn the other hand, in September 2023, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)\u00a0announced that it had signed 13 new contracts to expand its presence in Turkiye, with the new projects anticipated to add another 2,000 rooms to its already large portfolio of over 8,000 rooms nationwide. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) currently runs 48 properties in Turkiye under 21 brands. The Most Loved Country in Asia\n\n06photo/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo prepare the list of the\u00a0most loved countries in Asia, we consulted five articles published by Insider Monkey over the past year on the 15 Most Respected Countries in Asia, 15 Friendliest Countries in Asia, 20 most visited countries in Asia, 20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia, and 20 Most Democratic Countries in Asia, and assigned each of these five metrics weights. 75% weight was assigned to the first three articles i.e., on respected, friendliest, and most visited countries in Asia, while 25% was allotted to countries\u2019 diversity and democratic credentials.\n\nIt was observed where a country ranked on each metric, and then it was assigned scores accordingly depending on each metric\u2019s weight. The\u00a020 most loved countries in Asia are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe most loved country in Asia is Malaysia!\n\n1. Malaysia\n\nRespect Rank: 8\n\nVisited Rank: 5\n\nFriendliness Rank: 2\n\nDiversity Rank: 14\n\nDemocracy Rank: 6\n\nOverall Score: 0.701\n\nMalaysia is the most loved country in Asia as it ranks high on all metrics considered in our research. It is the sixth most democratic country on the continent. Moreover, it is the fifth most visited country in Asia, welcoming over 10 million travelers in 2022. People head to the Southeast Asian country to not just get an experience of its stunning beaches and posh city life, but also explore the local culture and tradition, which is enriched by hospitable and friendly locals. Besides, Malaysia is also a very diverse country, with an ethnic fractionalization of 57%.\n\nTo learn about other deeply revered countries in Asia, you can check out our detailed report 20 Most Loved Countries in Asia.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from loved countries to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "A person performs a Google search on their mobile phone. Arkan Perdana / Unsplash\n\nEarly in 2020, Airbnb diverted about $800 million in spend on performance marketing \u2014 mostly Google keyword advertising \u2014 and tilted more toward marketing its brand in avenues like video, social media and public relations.\n\nAirbnb had been criticized pre-pandemic for spending too much of its marketing on Google. In addition to leaning away from Google starting in 2019 and 2020, Airbnb tested participating in Google Vacation Rentals, the price comparison service, but ultimately decided not to get involved.\n\nBut at the Bernstein conference Thursday, Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Ellie Mertz said during an interview on stage that the company over the last year has spent \u201cmodestly more\u201d on marketing through Google. Airbnb has used Google advertising products including \u201ckeywords\u201d and Audiences, she added.\n\nAirbnb Is Spending on Google Where It Makes Sense\n\nMertz said Airbnb \u201cdials up and down\u201d marketing on Google where Airbnb sees the opportunity for efficient marketing spend.\n\nBased on several Airbnb initiatives over the last year, the company has been able to spend \u201cmodestly more\u201d on Google \u201cand maintain greater efficiencies,\u201d she said.\n\nMertz emphasized that \u201cperformance marketing continues to be a minority of our overall marketing spend\u2026 This is not a big portion of our marketing budget or a percent of revenue,\u201d she added.\n\nAsked why Airbnb wouldn\u2019t spend 10 times more on performance marketing to drive 5% of incremental revenue growth, Mertz said: \u201cFirst and foremost, we don\u2019t depend on them very substantially. So as I said earlier, 90% of our traffic is coming from direct sources, which is a great thing in the overall context of the P&L.\u201d\n\nAirbnb is an outlier among online travel companies. Booking Holdings and Expedia Group spend billions of dollars on Google performance marketing, and that is a much higher percentage of their revenue annually than Airbnb\u2019s spend on the search engine.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Purple Rain House is part of the Airbnb Icon marketing blitz. Eric Ogden\n\nAirbnb hasn\u2019t been vocal about its strategy for experiences since it paused adding new ones last year or even a couple of weeks ago when it confirmed it has been removing some experiences providers from its platform.\n\nBut Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Ellie Mertz said Thursday at a Bernstein conference that the company is reinvesting in adjacent products \u2014 she had been talking about experiences and hotels. And Mertz discussed some of the company\u2019s learnings about why its experiences product hadn\u2019t taken off as planned.\n\nAsked by moderator Richard Clarke of Bernstein why Airbnb experiences \u201chasn\u2019t quite worked so far,\u201d Mertz said \u201ceveryone\u201d in travel wants to get their customers to book the whole suite of end-to-end travel products, presumably flights, lodging, cars and experiences.\n\n\u201cAnd what makes that challenging is that outside of packaged tour travel, consumers don\u2019t go to one site and book everything all at the same time,\u201d Mertz said.\n\nActually, she said, travelers have \u201ca delayed stage purchasing pattern, meaning you get your transportation and then your accommodations, and then closer to the trip, you get activities and services etc\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo part of making a build out \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say connected trip because someone else uses that \u2014 but part of increasing the offering is, How do you merchandise to the consumer at the right time to make it useful for them?\u201d\n\nSo like Booking.com boss Glenn Fogel, who has touted a connected trip strategy in recent years, Airbnb wants to become more effective in getting its customers to book both accommodations and experiences on the platform.\n\nBut Airbnb knows many guests likely won\u2019t book experiences at the same time they make a reservation for a stay.\n\nThe Secret Sauce for Experiences\n\nThe secret sauce is figuring out how and when to do it, according to Mertz\u2019s logic.\n\nln addition to the proper timing, Mertz said Airbnb needs to ensure that experiences are \u201cappropriately priced.\u201d\n\nA third element to a successful experiences product would be personalization, she said.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cknowing something about the consumers such that you are not just barraging them with everything that\u2019s available in a particular market but merchandising to them the things that they would enjoy and are relevant to them, but also the travel use case that they are about to go on,\u201d she said.\n\nMetz said Airbnb will apply these learnings as \u201cwe restart those expansion opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe company may have restarted its experiences a tad with its recent launch of Airbnb Icons, which is a series of high-profile celebrity- and show-business oriented stays and experiences available to a limited number of Airbnb customers.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nAirbnb's Improving Profits\n\nOver the last three years, Airbnb has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. In impressive fashion, Airbnb's EPS grew from US$3.19 to US$7.78, over the previous 12 months. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 144%.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While Airbnb did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Airbnb's future profits.\n\nAre Airbnb Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Airbnb, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$27b. Coming in at 29% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.\n\nIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Airbnb, the median CEO pay is around US$14m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Airbnb CEO received total compensation of just US$295k in the year to December 2023. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.\n\nShould You Add Airbnb To Your Watchlist?\n\nAirbnb's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The strong EPS improvement suggests the businesses is humming along. Airbnb certainly ticks a few boxes, so we think it's probably well worth further consideration. Of course, just because Airbnb is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google, Amazon and Airbnb won the backing of Europe's top court on Thursday in their fight against an Italian rule requiring them to provide information on themselves.\n\nThe dispute between the companies and Italian authorities centered on provisions adopted in 2020 and 2021 mandating online service providers operating in Italy to sign up to a register and submit various types of information, as well as paying a financial contribution or risking a fine.\n\nThe companies had challenged the requirement, saying it was contrary to EU legislation which says online service providers are only subject to the rules of the country where they are established, while countries where they provide a service must refrain from applying their laws.\n\n\"A member state may not impose additional obligations on an online service provider established in another member state,\" judges in the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) said.\n\n\"Italy cannot impose on providers of those services established in other member states additional obligations which, although required for the provision of those services in that country, are not imposed in their member state of establishment,\" they said.\n\nBoth Google and Airbnb have their European headquarters in Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg. U.S. online travel services provider Expedia, based in Spain, also objected to the requirement.\n\nThe ruling is final and cannot be appealed.\n\nThe cases are C-662/22 | Airbnb Ireland, C-667/22 Amazon Services Europe, C-663/22 Expedia, C-664/22 Google Ireland, C-666/22 Eg Vacation Rentals Ireland and C-665/22 Amazon Services Europe.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun CheeEditing by Bernadette Baum and Ana Nicolaci da Costa)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Airbnb's (ABNB) upside potential following a conservative second-quarter guidance makes the stock an attractive buying opportunity amid recent underperformance, Wedbush Securities said in a note on Tuesday. \r\n\r\nThe brokerage upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and increased its price target to $165 from $160. Shares of Airbnb were up 2% in Tuesday trade.\r\n\r\nThe stock has declined 8.5% since the vacation rental company's first-quarter earnings report earlier this month, compared with gains reported by the Nasdaq and Booking Holdings (BKNG), according to Wedbush.\n\n\"We think investors should take advantage of this period of relative weakness and see potential upside to near-term estimates following disappointing (second-quarter) guidance that we view as conservative given positive travel data points\" so far in the quarter, a group of analysts including Scott Devitt said. \r\n\r\nTravel demand appears resilient through the near term, according to Devitt. Recent industry commentary has indicated healthy demand for the summer travel season buoyed by the Paris Olympics and Euro Cup, he said.\r\n\r\nAirbnb engagement data quarter-to-date points to web traffic growth of about 6.5% on a year-over-year basis, marking an acceleration from 3.5% in the first quarter, Wedbush said, citing data from Similarweb.\r\n\r\nThe brokerage lifted its second-quarter revenue forecast to $2.74 billion from a prior view of $2.73 billion and its earnings per share target to $0.88 from $0.84. Analysts on average are modeling for second-quarter revenue of $2.72 billion and GAAP EPS of $0.90 for the ongoing period. Airbnb earlier this month guided for second-quarter revenue between $2.68 billion and $2.74 billion, indicating 8% to 10% year-over-year growth. \r\n\r\nThe Wedbush estimates for the second-half and full-year were also sweetened. It now sees revenue of $11.27 billion in the ongoing year, up from a prior view of $11.15 billion. Its EPS estimate climbed to $4.34 from $4.19. The consensus is for revenue of $11.17 billion and GAAP EPS of $4.52 in 2024.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Last week, China-based electric vehicle makers XPeng Inc. XPEV and Li Auto LI released their first-quarter 2024 results. The commercial EV developer Workhorse Group WKHS and EV charging solutions provider Beam Global BEEM also unveiled their quarterly results. Meanwhile, EV charging company ChargePoint Inc. CHPT also made it to the top stories with its partnership with Airbnb to simplify EV charger installation for U.S. Airbnb hosts, enhancing guest convenience.\n\nLast Week\u2019s Top Stories\n\nLi Auto reported 17 cents per U.S. ADR in the first quarter of 2024, down 10.5% year over year.\u00a0Revenues rose 36.4% to $3.6 billion in the quarter under review. Deliveries jumped 53% to 80,400 units. Vehicle sales (accounting for 94.6% of total revenues) were up 32.3% to $3.4 billion. However, Li Auto\u2019s vehicle margin decreased to 19.3% in the first quarter of 2024, down from 19.8% in the first quarter of 2023 and 22.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023, owing to a reduction in the average selling price of vehicles. R&D and SG&A costs increased 64.6% and 81%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nLi Auto guided second-quarter deliveries to be between 105,000 and 110,000 units, up 21.3-27.1% year over year. Revenues for the current quarter are projected in the range of RMB 29.9-31.4 billion, calling for an increase of 4.2-9.4% year over year.\n\nLi Auto currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nXPeng incurred a loss of 20 cents per U.S. ADR in the first quarter of 2024.

The loss, however, narrowed from 15 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $1.34 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 55.37% and also declined from $1.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2023 amid lower W4 CC vehicle sales.\u00a0R&D and SG&A costs decreased 51.3% and 4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The company is finalizing the Aero business divestiture with a third party in the current quarter, expecting monthly cost savings of about $375,000,\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, Workhorse\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.7 million, down from $25 million as of Dec 31, 2023.

Revenues of $14.6 million rose 12% year over year, thanks to the Amiga buyout and an increase in federal orders. The top line, however, missed the consensus mark of $18 million. Beam Global saw a 310% rise in first-quarter EV charging orders from the business/commercial sector and secured several notable orders and agreements in the United States and Europe.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased to $4.5 million (31% of revenues) in the quarter under review, compared to $3.8 million (30% of revenues) in the year-ago period. On Mar 31, 2024, BEEM had cash of $5 million, compared with $10.4 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\u00a0The company has a $20 million backlog and a pipeline exceeding $160 million.

        "content": "Airbnb upgraded, Southwest downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nWedbush upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $165, up from $160. The stock is down 8.5% since the company reported Q1 earnings on May 8 and investors should take advantage of this period of relative weakness, the firm tells investors in a research note. Truist upgraded Deckers Outdoor(DECK) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $1,200, up from $1,011. While noting that Hoka's DTC trends did decelerate in Q4 as the firm had previewed, Truist also notes that a very significant acceleration of wholesale sell-in activities was a key driver and argues that the brand's current trends, momentum and the outlook for the brand across channels and regions \"appear very bullish.\" Truist upgraded On Holding(ONON) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $46, up from $34. The company's trends have remained robust despite some broader discretionary pressure, and On's momentum continues to build and it is positioned well to gain share as Nike (NKE) is \"pulling back on fan-favorites\" as part of its franchise lifecycle management strategy. JMP Securities upgraded Duolingo (DUOL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $260 price target. The firm sees \"multiple catalysts\" that can sustain the company's growth and notes the shares are now trading for 19.9-times JMP's 2026 \"Blue Sky\" free cash flow. Citi upgraded DuPont (DD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $95, up from $85, following its plan to separate into three distinct, publicly traded companies. Feedback from investors on the news has been positive, as the flexibility of operating as standalone businesses should create value through focused growth and portfolio clarity, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nArgus downgraded Southwest (LUV) to Hold from Buy. The firm cites the company's high employee costs and delayed aircraft deliveries that make the road to recovery for Southwest \"longer than anticipated.\" Rosenblatt downgraded Zscaler (ZS) to Neutral from Buy with a $190 price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on May 30. The firm says sales attrition is weighing on the company's Q4 and fiscal 2025 prospects. Wells Fargo also downgraded Zscaler to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $182, down from $275. RBC Capital downgraded Sarepta (SRPT) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $142, down from $157, ahead of the June 2 Elevidys FDA action date. The firm still expects significant share upside on the broadest label with $2.6B peak annual U.S. sales potential, but with the shares having appreciated 50% in the last six months, many investors appear to already expect label expansion and regulatory flexibility. Raymond James downgraded Frontier Group(ULCC) to Market Perform from Outperform with no price target. While the firm sees valuation support, it is increasingly concerned about potential near-term earnings downside risk and mixed results so far in the company's ability to improve operational performance. TD Cowen downgraded Triumph Group(TGI) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $14, down from $19.50, citing moderated cash flow due to pared Boeing (BA) 737 and 787 ramp plans and expected lower military results.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nCiti resumed coverage of Kenvue (KVUE) with a Neutral rating and $21 price target following the completion of a secondary offering on May 14. The firm sees an \"unclear\" near-term outlook for the company, driven by difficult Q2 comparisons, a slow start to the allergy season, Neutrogena struggling to recover share, and uncertainty on its China recovery. Deutsche Bank resumed coverage of Aon plc(AON) with a Hold rating and $311 price target. The firm believes 2024 will be a transition year for the company, as it integrates NFP, a business characterized by higher growth but lower margins, and accelerates its restructuring efforts. Mizuho initiated coverage of Medpace (MEDP) with a Buy rating and $435 price target. The firm believes Medpace is an attractive investment opportunity given its industry-leading organic growth profile, expertise in serving small- to mid-size biotechnology companies, and solid balance sheet and cash flow which provide financial flexibility. Stifel initiated coverage of Viking Holdings(VIK) with a Buy rating and $37 price target. Viking \"is the ultimate growth story\" within the luxury travel cruise segment as it will grow EBITDA, on average, around 17% for the next three years, the firm tells investors in a research note. UBS, BofA and Wells Fargo also initiated the name with Buy-equivalent ratings, while Morgan Stanley and Redburn Atlantic started coverage of Viking with Neutral-equivalent ratings. Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Ares Management(ARES) with a Buy rating and $176 price target. The firm views Ares as well-positioned to capitalize on long-term secular trends that are driving growth in the alternative asset management sector and believes Ares can grow fee-related earnings, or FRE, at a 22.4% compound annual growth rate from 2023-2026.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Despite the stock market being at an all-time high, plenty of bargains remain to be found for investors. The bull rally that began in autumn 2022 is only now starting to broaden out to include utilities, retailers, industrial stocks and other sectors of the economy. It\u2019s no longer just big tech stocks that are marching higher. So, many stocks are starting to rise.\n\nSo, this presents an opportunity for investors to buy stocks as they bottom and begin to climb higher. Many well-known companies have stocks that still look cheap in terms of valuation and share price. Catalysts such as strong earnings are starting to move share prices higher. For other stocks, a post-earnings dip is presenting a buying opportunity. However you look at it, bargains abound in the current market.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three cheap stocks that could be worth a fortune by summer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter being in the doldrums for the last five years, things are starting to look up for Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS). The share price jumped 25% higher after the maker of winter parkas beat analyst expectations for its latest financial results. Investors needn\u2019t worry that they\u2019ve missed the move in GOOS stock. Even with the big post-earnings bounce, Canada Goose\u2019s share price is still down 72% over the last five years.\n\nFurthermore, GOOS stock still has plenty of room to run, and the move higher may have just begun. After struggling with declining sales coming out of the pandemic, the company finally reported a turnaround. EPS came in at 19 cents compared to 7 cents that was forecast among analysts. Revenue in what was the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 totaled $358 million, beating expectations of $315.5 million.\n\nKey to the turnaround were sales in Asia-Pacific, including China, which rose 29.6% during the quarter. In North America, sales rose 24.5% year-over-year (YOY) after a 14% decline in the previous quarter. The latest financial results come after Canada Goose announced in March plans to cut 17% of its global workforce as it seeks to realign its business.\n\nChubb Ltd. (CB) Person holding cellphone with logo of Swiss insurance company Chubb Limited on screen in front of business webpage. CB stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nNews that Chubb Ltd. (NYSE:CB) was the mystery stock that Warren Buffett had been concealing has lit a fuse under the Swiss insurer\u2019s share price. Buffett has built an astounding $6.7 billion stake in Chubb Ltd., which has sent its stock up nearly 10% in only a few days, hitting a 52-week high in the process. Buffett\u2019s purchase of nearly 26 million shares of the Zurich-based property and casualty insurer is seen as the ultimate vote of confidence in the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, CB stock has been a strong performer, having gained 37% over the last 12 months, including a 20% gain this year. However, the valuation still looks attractive, with the shares trading at only 12 times future earnings estimates. And, its quarterly dividend payment of 86 cents per share gives the stock a strong yield of 1.25%. Given the share price appreciation, low price-earnings ratio and decent dividend, it\u2019s easy to understand Buffett\u2019s fondness for CB stock.\n\nNow that Buffett has built a stake in Chubb, the share price is likely to continue rising, making it a cheap stock to buy.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) meone holds the Airbnb logo in front of Dresden, Germany landscape. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock\n\nAnyone looking to buy a post-earnings dip should consider Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Shares of the short-term rental company dropped nearly 10% on forward guidance that was below Wall Street estimates, presenting a buy-the-dip opportunity. The guidance obscured what was a solid print from Airbnb.\n\nFor the first quarter, the company posted EPS of 41 cents, which was well ahead of a consensus estimate of 24 cents. The quarterly profit was up 126% from a year ago and the company\u2019s best first quarter ever.\n\nRevenue totaled $2.14 billion, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.06 billion. Sales were up 18% from a year earlier. Gross bookings came in at $22.90 billion, up 12% YOY, while nights and experiences booked rose 9.5% to $132.6 million. Despite the strong quarter, Airbnb\u2019s guidance fell short of expectations, sending the stock lower.\n\nInvestors should pick-up the stock on the cheap. Year-to-date (YTD), ABNB stock is up only 8%. However, the share price is 15% below its 52-week high and trading at only 19 times future earnings estimates. In time, the stock should rise, especially with the busy summer travel season upon us.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) Potentially Undervalued?",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$168 and falling to the lows of US$141. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Airbnb's current trading price of US$144 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Airbnb\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nView our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nIs Airbnb Still Cheap?\n\nThe share price seems sensible at the moment according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 18.57x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers\u2019 ratio of 18.46x, which means if you buy Airbnb today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe Airbnb should be trading in this range, then there isn\u2019t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Airbnb\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Airbnb generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Airbnb, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -18%, which doesn\u2019t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Currently, ABNB appears to be trading around industry price multiples, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on ABNB, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on ABNB for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. This means there\u2019s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven\u2019t considered today, which can help gel your views on ABNB should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio.\n\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Airbnb from their most recent forecasts. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Airbnb, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Travel is back in business. Since the latter years of the Covid-19 pandemic, travel stocks to buy have sharply rebounded, boosting earnings and share price of many companies within the sector. The Amplify Travel Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:AWAY) buys shares of travel agencies and travel technology businesses. The ETF has risen around 20.65% over the past twelve months, as travel public companies continue to benefit from travel demand.\n\nWhile travel stocks to buy enjoy some love from the market, below are three stocks to buy now.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a leading global online travel agency. The holdings company operates household names, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com and Agoda.com. The Covid-19 pandemic hit the company\u2019s revenue and earnings hard in 2020. In fact, revenue contracted nearly 55% on a year-over-year basis, while net income came in at a meager $59 million. Since then, Booking\u2019s financial figures have surged well beyond where they were during the pre-pandemic era. In 2023, revenue grew 25% to $21.4 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe firm\u2019s first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024 surpassed both revenue and earnings estimates. Quarterly revenue increased 17% YOY to $4.4 billion, while net income increased 192% YOY to $776 million.\n\nBKNG shares have risen over 9% since the start of the year. The company\u2019s recent earnings beat, coupled with the fact its stock trades at 21.4x forward earnings, make it a compelling investment.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) makes the second entry on this list. The company is a household name for travelers and vacationers across the globe. Airbnb\u2019s online marketplace allows both hosts and guests to connect via their personal computers or mobile devices to offer and book living spaces. The online platform has grown up in terms of its financial statements. Before and during much of the pandemic years, Airbnb was a loss-making company that had been burning significant amounts of cash. However, since 2022, Airbnb has become profitable on a GAAP basis and has continued to improve EPS from year to year.\n\nIts recent first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024 is a testament to the firm\u2019s ability to grow revenue robustly while keeping margins up. Revenue for the first quarter, as well as earnings, surpassed what Wall Street analysts had been predicting. In particular, revenue increased 18% to $2.1 billion while net income came in around $264 million, making this quarter the company\u2019s most profitable since inception.\n\nStory continues\n\nABNB trades at a clear premium to a platform like Booking, but robust revenue and earnings growth still makes it a travel stock to buy.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Inside the airplane cabin of a Delta flight.\n\nSource: EQRoy / Shutterstock.com\n\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is a well-known full-service airline for those living in the United States. The airline has built a robust domestic service that can get anyone to any major city in the country; Delta\u2019s international service includes global hubs across Latin America, Western Europe and East Asia. The airline benefitted immensely from pent-up travel demand after Covid-19 restrictions were done away with. Delta\u2019s revenue growth figures in 2021 and 2022 both encroached upon triple-digit territory.\n\nFourth quarter results for fiscal year 2023 saw quarterly earnings double on a year-over-year basis, as a result of not just strong domestic travel but, particularly, the rebound of international travel routes. First-quarter earnings results for fiscal year 2024 also surpassed estimates as \u201cconsumers continue[d] to prioritize travel as a discretionary investment in themselves.\u201d\n\nThat is to say, despite inflationary pressures, consumers are still willing to spend on travel, which can only help Delta Air Lines and its shares in the near and medium term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "It\u2019s time to jump back into EV charging stocks to buy. At the moment, electric vehicle sales are outpacing the growth of EV charging stations. In 2023, U.S. consumers bought about 1.2 million EVs, which accounted for about seven percent of total new car sales,\u00a0says The Washington Post.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s just not enough spots to plug in and charge. The publication added:\n\n\u201cBetween 2016 and 2023, EV registrations in the United States grew almost three times faster than the United States\u2019 public charging infrastructure. In 2016, there were seven electric cars for each public charging point; today, there\u2019s more than 20 electric cars per charger.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition,\u00a0according to McKinsey,\u00a0the U.S. will need about 28 million ports by 2030. They added that private ports could increase from about 2.5 million to 27 million.\n\nWith more EVs likely to roll out, far more public charging stations are needed. That being said, investors may want to start accumulating EV charging stocks while they\u2019re cheap. With more EV sales expected, and demand for charging set to increase, most of the top EV charging stocks to buy should benefit.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) An image of two Evgo, Inc. (EVGO) charging stations\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince bottoming out at $1.65,\u00a0EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) now trades at over $2 and could easily accelerate higher. For one, earnings are improving.\n\nIn its first quarter, the company posted an EBITDA loss of $7.2 million on sales of $55.2 million. Meanwhile, analysts were looking for a loss of $13.3 million on sales of $45.2 million. The company also ended the quarter with 3,200 charging stalls \u2014 up about 38% year over year.\n\nCEO Badar Khan spoke in a news release:\n\n\u201cEVgo\u2019s business continues to grow and achieve record results, demonstrating the strength of our business model of owning and operating a fast-charging network as more Americans drive electric vehicles. The tailwind of\u00a0long-term EV adoption gives us confidence that we will achieve adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2025.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, according to analysts at\u00a0RBC Capital, EVGO is well positioned to benefit as the auto industry moves towards electrification.\n\nEventually, I\u2019d like to see EVGO retest $3.20 initially.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nSince late April,\u00a0Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) ran from about $2.30 to a recent high of $3.40. From here, if it can break through overhead resistance at $3.60, it could potentially test $4.40.\n\nHelping, the company just became one of the official\u00a0EV charging providers for New York. That will allow Blink Charging to now electrify state and municipal fleets, in addition to providing electrification for employees, residents and visitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings haven\u2019t been too shabby either. In its recent quarter, BLNK posted an earnings per share loss of 13 cents, which beat by seven cents. Revenue of $37.57 million, up 73.1% year over year, beat by $2.96 million. It also reiterated its target of achieving positive adjusted EBITDA by December of this year, too.\n\nIn addition, analysts at\u00a0D.A. Davidson recently reiterated a hold on the BLNK stock with a $5 price target. While that won\u2019t happen overnight, give it time. With EV demand gaining momentum, and a growing need for EV charging, BLNK will benefit.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is showing big signs of life again, too.\n\nAfter finding support at $1.20, CHPT is now back to $1.79. From here, if it can break above resistance at $1.90, I\u2019d like to see it retest $2.30 initially.\n\nMost recently, CHPT and\u00a0Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) partnered to install EV chargers at listings and expand access to chargers across the country.\n\nEven more impressive, as noted in a CHPT release:\n\n\u201cAccording to Airbnb data, listings that offer an EV charger are booked for more nights and generate more income on average, when compared to listings without an EV charger. Airbnb searches for listings with EV chargers grew more than 80 percent from 2022 to 2023. Similarly, ChargePoint data shows that its North American drivers spent more than 79 million hours charging in residential settings in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe stock was also\u00a0defended by Needham, which has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and a price target of $3 on CHPT. The firm noted that it\u2019s enthusiastic about second-half gross margin accretion and OPEX (operating expense) leverage, and is now less concerned about the company\u2019s future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

Airbnb said recently that its global average daily rate in March for a one-bedroom was $114 while CoStar reported that the equivalent rate for a hotel room was $140.16.\n\nOn that basis, Airbnbs were clearly cheaper.\n\nThat is important to Airbnb: After all its original tagline, according to co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, was \u201ca cheap, affordable alternative to a hotel.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s unpack some of the ways those numbers may be skewed.\n\nFirst, they don\u2019t capture the total cost to guests. For example, they don\u2019t include Airbnb cleaning fees \u2014 still a source of outrage among guests \u2014 or hotel resort fees, nor do they include other fees and taxes.\n\nIn addition, CoStar includes hotel data from China, and Airbnb withdrew from domestic China in 2022. Guests who book Airbnbs and hotels often travel in groups, and affordability probably skews in Airbnb\u2019s favor there because you can generally accommodate more people in one listing. These numbers are averages of all rooms, from luxury to economy. If you\u2019re not interested in spending a lot, it\u2019s more useful to compare within categories.\n\n\u201cIf somebody is just looking to book something based on price, they might go for an economy (hotel) room,\u201d said Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar Group. \u201cThat\u2019s 70 bucks versus what Airbnb is talking about, which is $114 for a one bedroom.\u201d\n\nTo be precise, CoStar found that that average global nightly rate for an economy class room in March, the latest statistics available, was $64.70 and it was $73.70 for a midscale class hotel room. So bargain hunters in those cases might find a hotel room as more affordable.\n\nFreitag said you can look at the \u201cplain average\u201d Airbnbs versus hotels globally, but it\u2019s more interesting to look at the use cases, whether it\u2019s a couple looking to splurge on a weekend getaway or a consultant seeking to be as frugal as possible.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the market, it depends on the time of year, it depends on the month,\u201d said Freitag. \u201cThey (Airbnb) obviously have high demand around the world in certain markets, versus the soft season for a lot of other markets. So it\u2019s hard to make a blanket statement about what\u2019s more affordable. It depends on who it is and what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nWhy Is Affordability an Issue Now?\n\nA couple of years ago, many Airbnb guests complained that cleaning fees had become excessive and that stay prices were rising. Airbnb introduced several measures to convince hosts to lower prices.\n\nChesky brought up the topic of Airbnb\u2019s affordability versus hotels in the company\u2019s earnings call in early May. \u201cNow one-and-a-half years ago, we noticed that there was a lot of concern about Airbnb prices increasing,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cAnd so we created a whole team to identify a series of initiatives to modulate our prices, and they are working.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that hosts set the prices of a stay \u2013 not Airbnb.\n\nIn late 2022, Airbnb began displaying the total price before taxes in regions where it wasn\u2019t already showing them, and 300,000 hosts have trimmed or eliminated cleaning fees, according to the company. At the end of 2023, 60% of Airbnb hosts charged a cleaning fee and 40% didn\u2019t.\n\nIn another prod to lower prices, Airbnb introduced a tool for hosts to show which rates in their neighborhoods are attracting bookings, and which aren\u2019t. Hosts might use the tool to see if their rates are too high to generate bookings.\n\nChesky also pointed out that two-thirds of hosts offer weekly or monthly discounts. So the longer you stay in an Airbnb, the more affordable it can become.\n\nSo while the average rate for a one-bedroom Airbnb fell 2% year-over-year to $114 in March, hotel prices increased 1.6% to $140.16.\n\n\u201cThe net of all of it is that hotel prices are up year-over-year and Airbnb listings on a like-for-like basis are down,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cSo today, the value of Airbnb versus hotel is better than it was a year ago, and I think that trend line is going to continue given all of our efforts.\u201d\n\nReliability Is the Next Hill to Climb for Airbnb\n\nIf affordability, based on nightly rates, is trending in the right direction for Airbnb, reliability is a looming challenge.\n\nAirbnb has long grappled with an inconsistent guest experience because its properties tend to be unique, and so are hosts. You basically know what you are going to get in a Marriott or Accor, but not necessarily in an Airbnb, even as carefully as you read a listing\u2019s reviews. In 2023, Airbnb removed 59,000 fake reviews and 157,000 bogus listings, the company said.\n\nAirbnb introduced superhosts years ago as a way to spotlight reliable hosts, and it also debuted Guest Favorites last year to entice travelers to book stays at properties that other guests thought were swell.\n\nIn an interview with Skift this month, Chesky argued that Airbnbs can be more reliable than mid-range hotels. \u201cGuests Favorites are more reliable than the Sheraton. You can quote that \u2013 \u2018Guest Favorites are more reliable than the Sheraton,'\u201d Chesky said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the services. And that will come down the road. Guest Favorites are more reliable than any midscale hotel. We have more data. We have data from half a billion reviews.\u201d\n\nChesky, during the earnings all, said that Airbnbs are more affordable than hotels, provide a more local experience, and are advantageous for groups.\n\n\u201cAnd so we think quality and reliability is a multiyear road map,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to be hearing every year major updates from us on quality and reliability.\u201d\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Everything looks expensive right now.\n\nFrom groceries to travel and fuel, we\u2019ve seen massive price hikes across all industries. And unless inflation cools, we must deal with it. However, investors can make the most of the impact of inflation on the stocks. Several stocks have seen a drop in value despite reporting impressive quarterly results.\n\nSo, could this be your chance to pounce? A few inexpensive high-potential stocks\u00a0can deliver jaw-dropping returns, and\u00a0they\u00a0have already reported strong fundamentals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach stock trades below $200 and present as a long-term buy and hold. As some of the best companies in their respective industries, these stocks have the strength to survive the market turmoil and rise higher. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeaten-down Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock is trading at $143 today and has lost 8% value in the past month. The company has been under pressure after the first-quarter results since investors weren\u2019t happy with the guidance.\n\nAirbnb had the best Q1 ever\u00a0with\u00a0133 million nights and experiences booked. It reported an 18% year-over-year (YOY) jump in revenue to hit $2.1 billion. The net income came in at $264 million,\u00a0which is\u00a0also its most profitable first quarter.\n\nHowever, the market only paid attention to the guideline for the second quarter\u00a0which\u00a0shadowed the impressive numbers. The management\u00a0is aiming\u00a0for a 9% revenue growth in Q2 to hit $2.7 billion, lower than the growth achieved in the first quarter and below estimates. Since Airbnb operates an asset-light model, it has the potential to gain financial strength with each profitable quarter.\n\nI believe Airbnb is a solid long-term play and am impressed at the company\u2019s bounce-back post pandemic. The summer travel could lead to better-than-expected results for the company.\n\nABNB gives\u00a0strong\u00a0competition to hotels and is using technology to enhance user experience. I think the market reaction is overdone, and the recent dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a poor start to 2024, and its price has only started to recover slowly.\u00a0The company reported a drop in iPhone sales\u00a0due to the economic downturn and\u00a0also\u00a0announced a massive buyback. Investors aren\u2019t very convinced about the future of Apple. But I believe this is one company that can bounce back at any time.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp 3% year-to-date (YTD), AAPL exchanges hands for $192 and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $199. If you can keep the drop in iPhone sales aside, Apple looks like a highly lucrative business with a\u00a0powerful\u00a0brand name. Its service segment is thriving and has outperformed other segments. In the recent quarter, it reported a 14% YOY revenue jump.\n\nMoreover, Apple enjoys high brand loyalty\u00a0and\u00a0this\u00a0has helped it expand\u00a0across the world.\u00a0Someone using an Apple product today might not easily switch to another brand. Yes, one cannot ignore the China problem, but I think Apple has the potential to handle this situation well.\n\nAlso, it has enough resources to keep innovating and offering the most technologically advanced products\u00a0to consumers.\u00a0Apple has announced the\u00a0largest\u00a0share repurchase in history\u00a0and\u00a0this move\u00a0has worked in its favor.\u00a0Additionally, it declared a 25-cent dividend for shareholders.\u00a0Looking at the company\u2019s growth story, the stock looks inexpensive at the current level and is a buy-and-hold.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

With two of its fastest-growing segments, Amazon has become so much more than an e-commerce company.\n\nIt saw a 13% jump in sales to $143.3 billion. The cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS)\u00a0showed a 17% YOY revenue growth while the advertising segment was up 24% YOY. Notably, the net income reached $10.4 billion\u00a0as\u00a0compared to the net income of $3.2 billion in the same period the prior year.\n\nFurther, Amazon has a highly diversified business with multiple revenue sources\u00a0which will continue driving growth.\u00a0It started investing in artificial intelligence (AI) well in time to gain a higher market share with AWS. Thus, its investments have\u00a0started\u00a0to pay off.

        "content": "As the world continues to embrace the joys of travel, post-pandemic, the industry is poised for sustained momentum throughout the rest of 2024. The post-pandemic \u201crevenge travel\u201d trend, which began in 2022, remains a significant driving force.\n\nData from The European Travel Commission shows a 7.2% increase in foreign arrivals and a 6.5% rise in overnight stays in Europe during the first quarter of 2024. Similarly, Collinson reports strong tourism volumes in Asia, with significant contributions from India and signs of recovery in China after years of depressed travel volumes. The travel industry is clearly booming. As a Greek citizen living on a Greek island, I witness this trend daily.\n\nThe following three names appear to be some of the best travel stocks to buy for exposure in the ongoing travel industry boom. These companies feature robust growth potential and scalable, high-margin business models, ensuring outstanding profitability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the leading global online travel and reservation service providers, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) naturally thrives during the industry\u2019s ongoing surge. With a top-tier portfolio of leading online platforms such as Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, and OpenTable, the company experienced a strong surge in revenues and profits in recent quarters.\n\nIn 2023, Booking\u2019s revenues increased by 25%, reaching a record $21.4 billion. This momentum appears to have seamlessly carried over into 2024, with Booking posting revenue growth of 17% in the first quarter to $4.4 billion. Notably, this marked a record first quarter in terms of revenues as well.\n\nIn the meantime, the company\u2019s business model, characterized by collecting high-margin booking fees, makes Booking profitability incredibly scalable. Evidently, its adjusted net income surged 39% in 2023 to $5.6 billion and 61% in this year\u2019s first quarter to $707 million. These growth rates should comfortably sustain elevated buyback activity and significant increases in the company\u2019s recently initiated dividend.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) A hand holds up the Airbnb (ABNB) logo outside a home in Estonia.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust like Booking, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is reaping the fruits of a flourishing travel industry. As the dominant peer-to-peer accommodation rental and experiences booking platform, Airbnb continues to thrive in the current industry landscape despite its periodic regulatory hurdles. I am personally quite fond of Airbnb\u2019s widespread prospects, which is why I became a shareholder in the company a couple of years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo illustrate Airbnb\u2019s ongoing momentum, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 18% in the first quarter to $2.14 billion. This result mirrors Booking\u2019s performance during the same period. In the case of Airbnb, this result was powered by the solid growth in the \u201cnights and experiences booked\u201d category (up 9.5% year-over-year), a further boost in average day rate (ADR), and this year\u2019s Easter timing.\n\nLooking ahead, Airbnb\u2019s bullish case seems solid. I\u2019m impressed by its dedication to innovation, including the recent launch of \u201cIcons.\u201d Further, I am excited about Airbnb\u2019s evolution into a free cash flow machine. Its free cash flow margin reached 89% in the first quarter, a further gain from last year\u2019s already impressive 87%. After years of analyzing stocks, I\u2019ve never come across another that consistently posts such high levels of free cash flow.\n\nHilton Worldwide (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) emerges as another standout choice in the current vibrant travel industry landscape. Reflecting on Booking\u2019s and Airbnb\u2019s robust revenue growth, it\u2019s evident that the demand for accommodation continues to soar. As a leading player in the hospitality business, Hilton is positioned to capitalize on this trend.\n\nHilton\u2019s revenues grew by 12.2% in the first quarter to $2.57 billion. The company experienced significant momentum in its \u201cfranchise and licensing fees\u201d division. This was, in turn, due to growth in the underlying number of hotels operating under one of its brands and higher occupancy rates due to the ongoing boom in the travel industry.\n\nIn the meantime, Hilton operates a rather lean business model. With the majority of its 7,626 properties, which include about 1.2 million rooms, being franchised, the double-digit revenue growth resulted in even stronger earnings growth. Earnings per share grew by 23.4% in Q1 on an adjusted basis to $1.53, compared to last year. This momentum is poised to last moving forward, fueling Hilton\u2019s bullish case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis held a long position in ABNB.

        "content": "With the summer travel season upon us, some investors may wonder if now\u2019s a good time to check in with the many travel and leisure plays, some of which may be overdue to heat up. Indeed, the summer travel season could provide a much-needed boost, but any increase in travel demand will not magically cause various consumer-facing headwinds to disappear. Inflation, while slowing, is still a tad too high. And the impact of last year\u2019s inflation could hurt for a long time.\n\nIn any case, look for the following three travel stocks to do their best to make the most of a period of seasonal strength. As they invest wisely in technologies while cutting back on various expenses, I see a higher path for the firms, some of which look far too cheap as we officially pass the midpoint of the second quarter 2024.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my opinion, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock has been under pressure after management delivered some pretty lackluster guidance following what would have been a rally-worthy quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough summer travel could fuel hot travel demand that helps set the stage for a bigger beat than expected, Airbnb has reportedly heard feedback from customers getting fed up with added costs. Undoubtedly, it can be a frustrating experience to book lodging and have the hefty number of fees add up. Specifically, customers are tired of the extra cleaning fees.\n\nWith all such fees, booking an Airbnb stay over a hotel or motel room may not be markedly cheaper. In any case, I still think the novelty and uniqueness of some of the Airbnb stays continue to work in its favor.\n\nFurther, it can use technology to help it deliver cost savings to customers without affecting its operating margin. Using AI to help deal with guest-host disputes represents just one corner where tech can help Airbnb deliver higher satisfaction at a lower price. AI-powered concierges represent another pathway toward growth and improved profitability.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock has surged, with shares now up over 43% in the past year. The travel agency is fresh off an impressive first-quarter sales and earnings beat. More travelers are part of the reason shares are starting to heat up well ahead of the summer travel season. As summer hits, my guess is recent momentum could extend.\n\nThough consumers are feeling the pinch, it certainly seems like many are more than willing to continue spending on leisurely expenses. Indeed, the emphasis on the experiential factor (especially among younger consumers) could be why Booking has been incredibly resilient. Either way, Booking\u2019s strategic bets (think AI personalization) also add to the long-term bull-case narrative.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven at close to all-time highs, I still like the stock while it\u2019s going for 28.6 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHiltonWorldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT) stock is a leading hotel chain that also stands to benefit from a hotter travel season. The stock has risen steadily, around 44% over the past year. Like Booking, Hilton delivered quite an impressive first quarter that beat analyst expectations on earnings. Additionally, the firm raised its full-year guidance, helping spark a sharp rally in shares.\n\nWith an impressive loyalty program in Hilton Honors that\u2019s helping fuel impressive booking numbers, HLT stock seems to be one of the premier stay plays for investors seeking to play a summer travel boom.\n\nAt writing, HLT shares go for 44.5 times trailing P/E. It\u2019s not a cheap stock. However, given its strong loyalty program and luxurious hotel pipeline, I see numerous catalysts that justify the premier price tag.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Cardboard cut-out of house to suggest fake house\n\nAirbnbs\u00a0are being advertised by fraudsters as long-term lets in order to steal deposits from unsuspecting would-be tenants.\n\nThe flats are advertised at reduced rents to attract potential tenants,\u00a0and\u00a0official-looking documents are handed out at viewings to encourage them to pay large deposits.\n\nBut once the deposit is paid, the fraudsters disappear, leaving the victims without their money \u2013\u00a0and\u00a0with no home to move into.\n\nOne two-bedroom flat, on a leafy street minutes away from Harrods in Knightsbridge, had been advertised on property website On The Market as available for long-term sharers. It was advertised at the price of \u00a32,350 a month, or \u00a3519 a week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe flat hunter told The Telegraph that she had arranged a viewing on May 2, with an agent supposedly working with a company called Real Estate Extravaganza Limited, which was incorporated in March this year, according to Companies House.\n\nShe was told to message the firm\u2019s Whatsapp account where she was introduced to a man called \u201cEdward\u201d who arranged to meet her at the property for a viewing.\n\nBut when she got into the flat, she found the real owner, who said that the flat was not in fact available for long-term rent but he does let the property out through Airbnb.\n\nShe picked up one of the 15-page \u201crental agreements\u201d that had been left on tables around the flat. It stated that she would need to pay six months\u2019 rent up front, a sum of more than \u00a314,000, alongside a deposit of one months\u2019 rent.\n\nThe property owner said the scam had happened at another of his properties, which he also rents out on\u00a0Airbnb,\u00a0and\u00a0so had become suspicious of a man taking the property for just one night.\n\nThe owner said when he went to check out his other flat, he found would-be renters taking pictures of the outside of the building. There was also an \u201cagent\u201d carrying out viewings,\u00a0who told him\u00a0he had been hired through messaging platform Telegram,\u00a0and\u00a0was being paid by the hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe said he had previously been paid to perpetrate a \u201csimilar con\u201d on Baker Street.\n\nWhen The Telegraph approached the online agency on the messaging service Whatsapp, which advertises as \u201cReal Estate Extravaganza\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0was registered as a company in March, the messages were delivered but not responded to.\n\n\u2018One victim was a single father with an 11-year-old daughter\u2019\n\nGreg Tsuman, of ARLA Propertymark, the membership body for property agents, said that rental scams were becoming a lot more common.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it a couple of times with some properties [registered with Arla]. Unfortunately, what is contributing to it is the rising rents\u00a0and\u00a0the fact that tenants are struggling to find properties on the open market.\n\n\u201cAll the fraudsters have to do is advertise it for a couple of hundred pounds a month less,\u00a0and\u00a0suddenly they are inundated with calls from desperate tenants,\u201d he said.\n\nIn one case, Mr Tsuman said fraudsters had managed to take money from three different tenants, who all turned up to move in at the same time.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey all arrived at the same time, thinking they were moving in. Clearly, it was all a fraud. It was quite sad because there was a single father with an 11-year-old daughter,\u00a0and\u00a0they had nowhere to go. It was absolutely devastating.\u201d\n\nMr Tsuman said other rental frauds that are common include tenants who are about to move out subletting\u00a0the property and\u00a0then disappearing with the deposit and advance rent payment;\u00a0and\u00a0those in council homes renting out their homes to private tenants for a higher rate than they pay themselves.\n\nCarry out checks before paying up\n\nHe said: \u201cA Land Registry search costs about \u00a35,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u2019s available to everyone. If you are in doubt, before parting with any money, do a search, which will tell you who owns the property, their name\u00a0and\u00a0the address, everything you need to know.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re being shown around, make sure you see a photo ID to confirm that the person in front of you is one on the title deeds,\u201d Mr Tsuman continued.\n\nAn\u00a0Airbnb\u00a0spokesman said: \u201cWe have zero tolerance for illegal activity\u00a0and\u00a0have banned this individual from the platform. With 1.5 billion guest stays to date, issues on\u00a0Airbnb\u00a0are exceptionally rare\u00a0and\u00a0we deploy strict measures\u00a0and\u00a0policies to protect our community, including removing bad actors.\u201d\n\nDan Wilson Craw, of campaign group Generation Rent, said fraudsters are preying on desperate renters.\n\n\u201cWe know that scams get more common when there is intense competition for homes, like there has been over the past couple of years,\u00a0and\u00a0in late summer as students look for accommodation before term starts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard of\u00a0Airbnbs\u00a0being used for fake viewings,\u00a0and\u00a0sometimes scammers pretend to be legitimate letting agents.\n\n\u201cThe government is introducing a landlord registration system which, if designed properly, will give would-be tenants one way of checking that the home they\u2019re viewing is legal to let out.\u201d\n\nMr Claw added: \u201cIn the meantime, tenants should be vigilant about the possibility of scams. If you\u2019re being asked for a lot of money, try\u00a0to contact the letting agent directly via their website to make sure you use correct payment details. And\u00a0remember if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for On The Market said it is investigating the alleged fraud.\n\nThe spokesman continued: \u201cUnfortunately, while rare, there are occasions when bad actors seek to take advantage of On The Market\u2019s site. When that occurs, On The Market acts swiftly to investigate the alleged fraud, as we are doing here.\u201d\n\nHave you been caught out by a similar scam?

        "title": "With 57% ownership of the shares, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Airbnb's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 9 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership 29% of Airbnb is held by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 57% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Airbnb.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Airbnb?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Airbnb does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Airbnb's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Airbnb is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Brian Chesky with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.8% and 7.2% of the stock. Interestingly, the second and third-largest shareholders also happen to be the Top Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively. This once again signifies considerable insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders.\n\nWe also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Airbnb\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Airbnb, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$27b stake in this US$92b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos Quietly Enters Residential Mortgage Business, Giving High Interest Rate Loans To Other Investors\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nJeff Bezos may be best known as the founder of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the billionaire has several lesser-known business interests across multiple industries. Through his investment firm, Bezos Expeditions, Bezos has made several early-stage investments in companies that have gone on to become industry leaders. Some of the more notable ones include Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and, more recently, Arrived.\n\nArrived has made a name for itself by fractionalizing single-family rentals and selling shares to retail investors with a minimum investment of $100. Since launching its first property in 2021, the real estate investment platform has already funded nearly 400 properties and has over $156 million in assets under management. Bezos first invested in Arrived during the company's $37 million Seed Round in 2021, then doubled down on that investment during the Series A round in 2022.\n\nNew Real Estate Debt Fund\n\nThe company just expanded its offerings to include the Private Credit Fund, giving its investors access to a pool of short-term real estate loans made to other investors and homebuilders. Unlike a typical residential mortgage, these loans have terms ranging from six to 36 months and are used to finance real estate projects, such as renovations, rehabs or new home construction. The fund is targeting individual loans between $100,000 to $500,000 but will evaluate loan opportunities as high as $5 million.\n\nThe fund generates cash returns by collecting interest payments on the loans and distributing them to investors. The Private Credit Fund is targeting an annualized yield of 7% to 9% with dividends paid monthly. The short-term nature of the loans also allows for more flexible liquidity options than many other debt funds. After six months, investors can request a redemption of all or a portion of their shares.\n\nView fund details >>\n\nDuring the announcement of the Private Credit Fund, Arrived co-founder and CEO Ryan Frazier said, \"We launched this new product based on direct feedback from our investor community, and we\u2019re confident that now is the right time to introduce it to investors. A number of debt investment opportunities have arisen that allow us to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns.\"\n\nGrowing Interest In Private Credit\n\nThe launch of Arrived\u2019s new fund comes at a time when the private credit market is experiencing significant growth, particularly in the real estate sector. The current high interest rate environment along with uncertainties in the equity markets has made this asset class more appealing to investors seeking high yields and low correlation to the stock market. The number of opportunities has also increased as banks have tightened their lending requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 7.04%, and typical bridge loans range from 9.5% to 12%. Considering long-term government bonds are paying roughly 4.5%, residential real estate-backed loans offer a compelling risk-adjusted return.\n\nInterested investors can visit the website here to view more details about the new Private Credit Fund and invest as little as $100.\n\nThis article Jeff Bezos Quietly Enters Residential Mortgage Business, Giving High Interest Rate Loans To Other Investors originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "They say there's no such thing as bad press, and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky is proving the point by insisting a 'Saturday Night Live' skit taking aim at his company just proves the brand has become a true household name.\n\nEarlier this year, actress Sydney Sweeney and comedian Chloe Troast appeared in the SNL bit, which labelled Airbnb setups as \"bland, generic, and downright uninviting.\"\n\nThey continued: \"Why stay in a hotel when for basically the same amount of money you could stay in a place with worst sheets and a camera in the toilet?\" (Indoor cameras in Airbnbs were banned in March.)\n\nIn addition to jibes about home decoration, the skit also took aim at the locations of some of the properties, a lack of privacy, and complex instructions for taking out the trash and accessing the property.\n\nBut the tongue-in-cheek barbs didn't faze Airbnb co-founder Chesky, who alongside Joe Gebbia became the first hosts on the platform in 2007.\n\nIn fact, Chesky seemed to welcome the notoriety in an interview with NBC 'News Nightly'released this weekend. He said the skit didn't \"sting,\" and added: \"I felt if anything like we have a huge responsibility, we're part of culture. The brand is a noun and verb used all over the world.\"\n\nResponding to customers' criticism of Airbnb's price and fees compared to hotels\u2014as mentioned in the SNL skit\u2014Chesky admitted that the company had lost its way \"a little bit.\"\n\nIndeed, a study from Which? released last year of thousands of short-term rentals across 50 global locations found that hotels were actually cheaper on average. The rentals listed on platforms like Airbnb tended to average $152 a night compared to $128 for a hotel room.\n\nPart of that sum will be the cleaning cost hosts charge to turn over the property between guests\u2014a fee previously not shown in the 'total' listing on the site.\n\nBut in September last year, Chesky confirmed that following an update\u2014which saw the fees added to the total\u2014more than 260,000 properties had lowered or removed their fees.\n\n\"Objectively the prices went up,\" Chesky admitted.\n\n\"The way I think about it is you have to listen to the community and when people tell us that Airbnb's aren't as affordable as they used to be and they feel we're nickel-and-diming fees, you take that very seriously.\"\n\nChesky said the result of Airbnb's work is that Airbnbs are cheaper than they used to be on a year-on-year basis, and hotels are going up.\n\nAirbnb did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe detector question\n\nOver the years, Airbnb has also faced scrutiny over safety, particularly regarding the monitoring of carbon monoxide in its properties.\n\nPreviously the company said it wanted all Airbnb hosts to confirm they had carbon monoxide detectors in their properties, though Chesky walked back that mandate in the interview this month.\n\nIt comes following an investigation by NBC, which alleged 19 deaths related to carbon monoxide occurred in Airbnb properties between 2013 and 2023.\n\nResponding to a question about this investigation and the company's previously proposed mandate, Chesky said: \"It is very hard to verify whether or not a property has a carbon monoxide detector but we're working really, really hard to make sure that every single property has a verified address, you understand where the place is, if there's any complaints about the property we can respond to it.\"\n\nAirbnb does provide CO monitors to hosts free of charge if they ask for them.\n\nChesky added that the company also provides information to customers staying in properties that have a high risk of carbon monoxide and makes it clear to guests if the property does not have a test.\n\n\"It's really hard to mandate things in 220 countries and regions and cities all over the world,\" he continued. \"If you mandate something you have to have a mechanism to verify that it happens.\n\n\"There's a really good question about whether a mandate is the right approach, but what is absolutely the right approach is to make sure that every single listing is safe, every single person is safe, and every single person knows what they're booking.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Airbnb Ups Its Experience Delistings Amid Strategy Revamp",
        "content": "Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, on May 2nd, dressing media at its product updates launch.\n\nAirbnb appeared to be doing a larger-than-usual purge of its travel experiences offerings from its site and app, leaving many providers of walking tours and other activities confused.\n\nPosts about the delistings began flooding into two private industry Facebook groups on Friday, with operators sharing screenshots of the emails they received. Most of the screenshotted notices said that Airbnb would officially remove the tours on June 20 and issue cancellations and refunds for guests who booked beyond that date.\n\nA spokesperson told Skift on Saturday that the company regularly evaluates listings.\n\n\u201cWe regularly evaluate Experiences based on the host\u2019s expertise, the activity\u2019s uniqueness and local relevance, and guests\u2019 ratings and reviews, and remove those that continue to provide low quality experiences,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nQuality control or strategic tweak?\n\nActivity in a private industry Facebook group suggested Airbnb may be doing a purge of an unknown number of listings that\u2019s greater than its usual spot quality control.\n\nIf true, such a purge would still leave Airbnb listing tens of thousands of travel experiences worldwide as a complement to its flagship home-sharing listings.\n\nThe messages to operators, which came from Airbnb Support, didn\u2019t state a specific reason but referenced that each given experience \u201cdoes not meet our standards.\u201d\n\nStaying the course\n\nAirbnb remained committed to the experiences category, according to comments made in its recent quarterly earnings call.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent launch of a product called \u201cIcons,\u201d positioned as extraordinary experiences, suggested its commitment to expanding its brand beyond just a place to stay. As CEO Brian Chesky noted, Icons is a brand investment, paving the way for future experience offerings.\n\nHowever, Airbnb does appear to have been making ongoing strategic shifts in how it sells experiences. In April 2022, Airbnb\u2019s homepage offered travelers the option to choose Places to Stay, Experiences, and Online Experiences. The following month, the company removed experiences from the homepage, making them accessible only after a traveler searched for accommodation. A year later, Airbnb said it would pause new submissions on its experiences platform.\n\nYet Chesky\u2019s comments earlier this month about the company\u2019s new \u201cicons\u201d offering voiced support for the experiences category.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do in addition to bringing back experiences\u2026 is we want to expand Airbnb\u2019s brand positioning to include more than just a place to stay,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cPeople are now starting to think about us for experiences. So I think we\u2019ve really paved the way for next year.\u201d\n\nStory continues Airbnb\u2019s Chesky Talks Icons, Paid Memberships, and Who Benefits From His Billion-Dollar Payday: Full Interview\n\nAirbnb\u2019s Chesky Talks Icons, Paid Memberships, and Who Benefits From His Billion-Dollar Payday: Full Interview\n\nAirbnb is finally taking a big, expensive swing into the experiences category with its launch of \u201cIcons.\u201d The non-traditional accommodations come with a non-traditional business model \u2013 they\u2019ll be free or low-cost to guests (but they want you to post them to your socials). And Chesky promises things will only get \u201ccrazier.\u201d\n\nRead More\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Have $500? 2 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy Without Hesitation in the New Bull Market",
        "content": "While some investors harbor hope of finding one or two stocks that blow up overnight and inject serious growth into their portfolio, and that can certainly happen, long-term investing often requires more patience and strategy. Investing in companies that you plan on holding for a minimum of five years, and preferably longer, is key to an investing strategy that holds up to the test of time.\n\nBuying companies you understand, and that align with your interests, financial objectives, and portfolio goals is key as well. As you diversify your portfolio across multiple stocks and sectors, there are plenty of great companies with promising long-term growth stories to explore.\n\nHere are two names to consider for your buy list right now if you have $500 to invest in stocks.\n\n1. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB) is a prime example of a pandemic stock that bolstered its business and financial strength with the passage of time. The stock is trading up about 40% from one year ago, as investors seem to be happy with the financial performance of the business. It delivered $2.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024, an 18% increase from one year ago, while profits rose 126% to $264 million.\n\nThat net income figure was the most the company has ever reported in a first quarter since Airbnb was founded. Free cash flow and cash flow from operations in the first quarter both totaled $1.9 billion, while trailing-12-month free cash flow came in at $4.2 billion.\n\nThe company also just launched its Summer Release, which includes new updates to the platform that positively impact hosts and guests. Recent updates include better price-setting tools for hosts and discounts on long-term stays for guests. In the Summer Release, Airbnb added new features to make planning group trips easier, an important point considering that more than 80% of bookings on the platform are for groups.\n\nThe Summer Release also includes format enhancements for messaging involving guests, hosts, and customer support, including emoji reactions and artificial intelligence-powered prompts for quick replies. Speaking of AI, CEO Brian Chesky gave more color to the platform's use of these tools in the first-quarter earnings call.\n\nI'll just give you three examples of things we've done with AI. You know, we've made it easier to host. We have a computer vision model that we trained in 100 million photos, and that allows hosts to, like the AI model, to organize all their photos by room. Why would you want to do this? Because this increases conversion rate when you do this. Number two, we launched last week AI-powered quick replies for hosts. So, it basically predicts the right kind of question or answer for a host to pre-generate to provide to guests. And this has been really helpful.\n\nAnd then, we've made a really big impact on reducing parties on Airbnb with our reservation screening technology. So, now, we're going much bigger on generative AI. ... Over time, we're going to bring the AI capabilities from customer service to search and to the broader experience. And the end game is to provide basically an AI-powered concierge.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only is the company a cash and profit machine, but its continued updates to the platform are driving both hosts and guests to Airbnb. Overall nights and experiences booked jumped just shy of 10% year over year in the first quarter, while Airbnb app downloads in the U.S. rose 60% from the year-ago period. In fact, 54% of all nights booked globally in the first quarter of 2024 were done through the mobile app.\n\nAirbnb benefits from both short- and long-term stay bookings, and is designed to cater to every type of travel need without accumulating the costs of managing the actual homes. If you're looking for an asset-light, profitable travel stock with a solid runway to growth ahead, Airbnb fits the bill on all counts.\n\n2. Chewy\n\nChewy(NYSE: CHWY) may look like a basic online pet store, but this growth stock is so much more than that. You wouldn't know how well the company is actually doing if you looked at the stock alone, which is trading down by more than 50% from where it was a year ago.\n\nEven though active customers are down slightly from one year ago, Chewy is growing net sales steadily and is profitable. In the company's fiscal 2023, it reported net sales of more than $11 billion, up 10% from the prior year.\n\nChewy was profitable for the first time in 2021. It turned a profit for the full year 2023, bringing in net income of $40 million in the 12-month period. While that figure was down from the prior year, Chewy's fourth-quarter net income of $32 million accounted for most of that annual figure, which represented a 370% year-over-year increase.\n\nChewy has been investing aggressively in its long-term growth opportunity. It recently expanded to its first international market (Canada), and is working to open brick-and-mortar vet practices. These aren't out-of-pocket moves for Chewy.\n\nThe business already has an online pet pharmacy, sells pet health insurance plans, operates an on-demand pet telehealth service, and has its own line of branded pet supplements. It also sells thousands of third-party pet-centric brands on its platforms. Most of Chewy's net sales actually come from subscription sales through its Autoship program.\n\nThose recurring Autoship sales comprised 76% of Chewy's net sales in 2023. More and more pet owners are taking advantage of Autoship too. Autoship customer sales rose 15% in 2023 from 2022, notably higher than the overall net sales growth rate for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, net sales per active customer reached a new record of $555, up 12% from one year ago. It's also worth mentioning that while pet spending is discretionary to a certain extent, some segments are not. These essential spending areas are where Chewy derives most of its growth. In 2023, 85% of its total net sales came from health-related spending and nondiscretionary consumables.\n\nA newer moneymaking initiative for Chewy is its sponsored ads program, which allows pet brands to advertise to shoppers on the platform. That new program helped drive its gross margin over 28% in the full year 2023. On a final high note, Chewy nearly tripled its free cash flow in 2023 compared to the prior year, with a total of $340 million on that metric.\n\nInvestors might want to take a slice of the action sooner than later, as it appears there's still a lot to like about this beaten-down stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Airbnb right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Airbnb, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Airbnb wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company\u2019s first-quarter 2024 results benefited from continuous improvements in Nights and Experiences Booked, owing to growing travel demand and the timing of the Easter holiday.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, enabled Airbnb to witness a positive trend in its Gross Booking Value. Growing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum across non-urban areas and increased demand for urban and cross-border travel, remained positive. A modest increase in Average Daily Rate was a plus. Strong momentum in Airbnb app downloads is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nHowever, greater volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties and rising competition in the online travel space is a headwind. The impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to hurt revenue growth in the near term.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Airbnb here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ONEOK, Inc. and PG&E Corp.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In some areas of England and Wales, more than one in 10 addresses are holiday lets - Manfred Gottschalk/Stone RF\n\nAirbnb owners are being targeted in a tax probe surge following a boom in holiday let investment.\n\nHM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) launched nearly 2,000 holiday let enquiries in 2023-24 \u2013 up from 375 the prior year and just 95 the year before that, according to official data.\n\nThe figures, obtained by The Telegraph in a freedom of information request, show there was a 20-fold increase in investigations between 2021-22 and 2023-24.\n\nThe tax office said it was investigating holiday home investors suspected of failing to declare income following a post-pandemic boom in staycations, while experts warned taxpayers could be caught out by coronavirus easements on tax rules which no longer apply.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt comes after the Government announced a \u00a3300m tax raid on short-term rentals, with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt unveiling the abolition of the Furnished Holiday Lettings regime (FHL) in the Budget.\n\nIt is part of a wider bid to disincentivise out-of-towners purchasing second homes in holiday hotspots, a rising trend which has been blamed on pricing locals out of the property market.\n\nThere are around 70,000 holiday homes in the UK, according to the latest Census data. In some areas of England and Wales, more than one in 10 addresses are holiday lets.\n\nDavid Hollingworth, of L&C Mortgages, a broker, said HMRC had been looking at the sector more closely ever since the pandemic when holiday lets soared in popularity.\n\n\u201cDuring the lockdown, people wanted the option of getting out of urban areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also seemed like a good investment because more staycations meant there was more competition which intensified the appeal to property investors who could therefore command a higher income.\u201d\n\nIn May 2023, the platform Airbnb was forced to share users\u2019 income data with HMRC so the tax office could identify holiday let owners it suspected had not paid enough tax.\n\nJohn Hood, of accountancy firm Moore Kingston Smith, said HMRC had been clamping down on owners \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the generous tax breaks on holiday lets.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently owners of short-term rentals are able to offset their mortgage interest payments from profits and claim capital gains tax relief on the sale of the property.\n\nMr Hollingworth said many property investors switched to holiday lets following the loss of mortgage interest tax relief in the buy-to-let sector between 2017 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThe holiday let sector was left out of many of the changes that happened in buy-to-let \u2013 so for example, you had the ability to offset costs whereas in the standard market you could only get 20pc relief.\u201d\n\nFor a property to qualify as an furnished holiday let, it must be commercially let for at least 105 days each year. During the coronavirus lockdowns, HMRC relaxed this condition.\n\nMr Hood said: \u201cHMRC took the sympathetic view during Covid and lockdown that people understandably migrated to the countryside and the coast to take advantage of their holiday homes.\u201d\n\nAfter the pandemic, HMRC likely feared that homeowners had become too comfortable and were either using their holiday let as their main residence or failing to let it out for 105 days, Mr Hood added.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, owners will not be deliberately seeking to avoid their tax obligations \u2013 but this naivety would not stop HMRC seeking to recover any tax lost.\u201d\n\nThe abolition of tax breaks on holiday threatens to leave investors nearly \u00a33,000 worse off a year from April, according to calculations by wealth manager Quilter.\n\nCouncils will soon be able to double council tax bills for owners of second homes that have been left empty for more than a year, under enhanced powers. These rules are already in place in Scotland.\n\nAn HMRC spokesman said: \u201cThe short-term property rental market is growing fast and it\u2019s our role to ensure owners pay the right tax, creating a level playing field for all. We have dedicated specific resource to opening enquiries where there is evidence that those renting out holiday lets have not declared income.\u201d",

        "title": "Airbnb Stock (NASDAQ:ABNB): Expanding Scale to Drive More Growth",
        "content": "Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), one of the largest accommodation booking platforms in the world, saw its stock tumble 7% last week after reporting first-quarter earnings. Despite short-term challenges, Airbnb is poised for continued growth aided by its growing scale, which presents investors with another opportunity to consider investing in it.\n\nThe company has introduced several new features to lure new guests and hosts to the platform and is also investing in AI to boost the booking experience for both parties. I am bullish on Airbnb, as I believe the company will take market share from other online travel agencies in the next five years.\n\nA Slowdown in Demand Is in the Cards\n\nThe travel industry made a soaring comeback in the last couple of years after dealing with COVID-related challenges in 2020 and 2021. The pent-up demand for travel helped Airbnb register exponential growth, but this year, travel demand is projected to normalize.\n\nThere are two main reasons behind these expectations for normalizing travel demand.\n\nFirst, consumer spending power has rapidly deteriorated in recent times due to persistently elevated inflation. In the U.S., excess savings in the pandemic era have been fully depleted. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, cumulative pandemic-era excess savings hit a high of $2.1 trillion in August 2021, but by March 2024, excess savings declined to a negative $72 billion. Given this, consumers are highly unlikely to splurge on travel as they used to in the last two years.\n\nSecond, travel inflation is on the rise again, which suggests traveling will cost more money in the foreseeable future. This, in turn, will spook consumers. According to NerdWallet\u2019s Travel Inflation Report for May, the cost of traveling is rising across key categories. In March, Airfare prices increased by 1% compared to February, while hotel room rates increased by a more pronounced 6.7%. Rental car prices also saw an uptick of 5.7%. Restaurant and theatre prices largely remained flat.\n\nTravel costs are increasing, while consumers are taking a hit due to persistent inflation, and this combination is likely to deteriorate travel demand in the foreseeable future.\n\nAsia Will be a Bright Spot\n\nAccording to Skift Research, 2024 will be one of the best years in recent memory for the travel sector in Asia. After struggling with mobility restrictions, Chinese travelers are finally getting back to traveling, and the research firm expects the Asia travel market to grow this year while Europe takes a back seat.\n\nAirbnb is strategically placing bets in Asia to benefit from this projected travel boom. The company has identified several growth markets, including India, China, and Korea, and is focused on investing in these markets to lure travelers. These investments include improving the localization of products to cater to locally popular payment methods and supporting more languages.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the company is updating the mobile app in China to offer a more familiar experience to Chinese consumers. They are also marketing the platform as a youth-friendly online travel agency, appealing to young travelers who are likely to prefer Airbnb lodgings over hotel rooms.\n\nScale Will be a Growth Driver\n\nOver the years, Airbnb has expanded its product offering and the end markets it serves. The company seems well-positioned to convert this scale advantage into tangible earnings.\n\nAccording to company filings, Airbnb currently operates in 220 countries and regions. At the end of 2023, the platform had more than five million hosts and had accommodated over 1.5 billion guests since its founding in 2007. The company, therefore, seems to enjoy a network effect where the massive number of hosts attracts more guests and vice versa. This network effect may prove to be a long-lasting competitive advantage.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s expansion into new product categories should also help the company\u2019s growth. The Experiences segment is one area the company is trying to reinvest itself in. Since mid-2022, Airbnb has slowly phased out the Experiences segment despite previously claiming that the addressable market opportunity in this segment eclipsed $1.4 trillion.\n\nDuring the Q1 earnings call, CEO Brian Chesky revealed that the company is bringing Experiences back to the platform and trying to rebrand it to support not just stays but other travel booking verticals.\n\nThe launch of Airbnb Icons earlier this year resonates well with these ambitions. This new category allows users to book a wide array of experiences and events, from sports to music. Airbnb\u2019s expansion into these new segments will expand its addressable market opportunity meaningfully in the coming years.\n\nAirbnb Luxe, which caters to high-end travelers by offering luxury accommodation options, and Airbnb for Work, which caters to professionals who are on work trips or working remotely, are two other new products that are likely to contribute positively to earnings growth in the long run.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s growing scale will be its biggest growth driver in the next five years.\n\nIs Airbnb a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts had mixed reactions to Airbnb\u2019s first-quarter earnings. Jefferies analysts concluded that Airbnb\u2019s failure to raise the outlook for expected Nights and Experiences for the next quarter suggests growth is slowing. The research firm also raised concerns about the seemingly disappointing outlook for EBITDA. Jefferies has a price target of $150 for Airbnb, along with a Hold rating.\n\nJPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised the price target from $140 to $145, as it believes the company\u2019s continued innovation will open new opportunities to grow.\n\nBoth Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Evercore ISI analysts highlighted growth concerns and identified the management\u2019s lackluster guidance for Q2 as the biggest factor contributing to the negative market sentiment toward Airbnb following the earnings print.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 36 Wall Street analysts, Airbnb stock comes in as a Hold, and the average ABNB stock price target is $152.97, which implies upside potential of just 4.9% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Airbnb\u2019s Long-Term Prospects Remain Bright\n\nAirbnb seems fairly valued based on Wall Street rankings revealed in this analysis, and the company is facing short-term headwinds that may limit growth in the next few quarters. However, the company is well-positioned to grow in the long term, aided by its growing scale and diversification into new product categories.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "I subscribe to the New York Times. While it doesn\u2019t have a massive amount of investment and finance coverage, it does have a small business section that covers actual small businesses, of which I am one. As I was reading a story last week, it got me thinking about small business stocks to buy.\n\nMuch like the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicle ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV) thematic ETF that invests in stocks benefiting from the move to electric vehicles from internal combustion-powered vehicles, I would be interested in a small business-focused thematic ETF that invests in companies that benefit from small business.\n\nThe tough part of developing an ETF methodology for selecting such stocks is identifying the right stocks. While it\u2019s great to have a small business focus, if a business is to get really big, it needs to move beyond the small business customer and add other target customers along the way.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, these three companies tend to focus on small businesses. All three are excellent stocks to buy to cash in on the entrepreneurial boom in America.\n\nSherwin-Williams (SHW) A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMy wife owns a small construction company that buys a lot of paint, much of it from the local Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) store. Whenever I\u2019ve happened to be with her when she\u2019s picking up a paint order, there always seem to be other small business people doing the same.\n\nFrom small fries to big builders, millions of people worldwide buy the company\u2019s paints, coatings, and other products.\n\nIn October 2021, I selected SHW and nine other companies whose stocks investors should buy for the next 15 years. As I said back then, the company benefited from the rise in housing prices, which has forced homeowners to keep their houses looking fresh and up to date.\n\nAt the time, 29 analysts covered SHW, giving it an Overweight rating and a $312.50 target price. Today, 30 analysts cover SHW, rating it Overweight and giving it a $346.46 target price, about 10% higher than where it currently trades.\n\nWhile the stock has gone sideways over the past 30 months, it is up significantly from its October 2022 low of around $200.\n\nIt\u2019s not cheap at 3.54x sales but not ridiculously overpriced if you\u2019re willing to hold for 3-5 years.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBetween its Cash App and Square businesses, Block (NYSE:SQ) has small businesses covered.\n\nIn the company\u2019s Q4 2023, shareholder, CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey wrote that because it sees many of its Cash App customers buying from Square sellers, it wanted to spend 2024 connecting these two ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe believe there\u2019s an opportunity to offer Square sellers the ability to customize profiles in Cash App, that allows for better discovery and ordering for customers\u2014ultimately connecting them to new local businesses through our commerce offerings,\u201d stated the shareholder letter.\n\nAs part of this focus, it consciously chose to pull back from global expansion, focus on the U.S. market, and generate more engagement with Cash App rather than just growing the number of active customers.\n\nDespite the belief that Jack Dorsey and the rest of the company are fixated on Bitcoin (BTC:USD), Dorsey pointed out in his Q1 2024 shareholder letter in early May that only 3% of the company\u2019s resources are Bitcoin-related projects.\n\nHowever, I recommend you read the letter. It makes a compelling argument about why the company cares about Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nAs for the company\u2019s multi-billion acquisition of Afterpay, the buy now pay later business has struck a chord with younger U.S. consumers, leading to 55% growth of its small and medium-sized (SMB) business network in 2023.\n\nBetween Square, Cash App, Afterpay, and Bitcoin, Block is bound to keep growing with SMBs.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has no doubt seen its fair share of large corporate hosts benefit from its global network of vacation rentals, the company remains dedicated to small businesses, whether we\u2019re talking about the millions of hosts worldwide or the direct economic impact of hosts utilizing products and services from small business people.\n\nFor example, an Airbnb blog post in November 2020 pointed out that its ecosystem of hosts and guests generates billions for the economy.\n\n\u201cBetween host earnings and guest spending, Airbnb\u2019s community generated $117 billion in estimated direct economic impact across 30 countries alone in 2019.* This represents important economic activity for small businesses in the communities hosts call home,\u201d Airbnb wrote.\n\nThere are more than five million Airbnb hosts, providing travelers with more than 7.7 million listings worldwide. The average host earns\u00a0 $13,800 annually, which means many are listing their vacation rentals for extra income. It\u2019s a useful side gig.\n\nSince Airbnb\u2019s founding in 2007, hosts have collectively earned more than $250 billion.\n\nAccording to a November 2023 post from the company, over 30% of surveyed hosts said they were small business owners beyond their vacation rental businesses.\n\nDespite protests of professionals entering the Airbnb business\u2014a 2023 report said that professional property managers only accounted for 1% of Airbnb hosts but 28% of total revenue\u2014it is still very much a business for small businesses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

There are concerns about Merck\u2019s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda\u2019s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\n\nAirbnb shares have gained +7.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Internet - Content industry\u2019s gain of +9.8%. The company\u2019s first-quarter 2024 results benefited from continuous improvements in Nights and Experiences Booked, owing to growing travel demand and the timing of the Easter holiday.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, enabled Airbnb to witness a positive trend in its Gross Booking Value. Growing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum across non-urban areas and increased demand for urban and cross-border travel, remained positive. A modest increase in Average Daily Rate was a plus. Strong momentum in Airbnb app downloads is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nHowever, greater volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties and rising competition in the online travel space is a headwind. The impacts of foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to hurt revenue growth in the near term.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Airbnb here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Enbridge Inc.

        "title": "Buy the Dip: 3 Stocks to Snap Up on Last Week\u2019s 10% Drop",
        "content": "Every once in a while, I like to consider stocks to buy on the dip. For my purposes, these are companies whose shares have fallen by 10% or more in a week of trading.\n\nThis time last year, I recommended three stocks that had fallen by 10% or more in the previous week\u2019s trading: Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO). They\u2019ve gained 38.98%, 2.01%, and 6.13% respectively over the past year. If you bought an equal amount of each stock, you\u2019d be up 15.71%, significantly less than the 26.64% gain of the S&P 500.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason buying the index isn\u2019t a bad idea. Buying on the dip doesn\u2019t work for every stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, the three stocks to buy this May that fell 10% or more last week should have solid businesses and even stronger financial statements.\n\nThat\u2019s not going to be easy. According to Finviz.com, 51 stocks with a market capitalization of $2 billion or more declined 10% last week. That\u2019s less than 3% of the 1,921 eligible companies.\n\nAlpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) A top aerial view of an open pit mine industry, with a big yellow mining truck for coal\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlpha Metallurgical Resources (NYSE:AMR) lost 13.73% over the past week. That puts it down more than 4% for 2024 but still up 26% over the past year.\n\nAlpha operates 21 underground and surface coal mines in Virginia and West Virginia, selling its products to steel businesses in more than 25 countries worldwide. Its May 2024 presentation indicates that it has 303 million tons of coal reserves.\n\nIn 2023, the global demand for steel bottomed at 1.76 million metric tons. However, over the next two years, it\u2019s expected to rise to 1.82 million, with a big push from India, which accounts for 37% of the company\u2019s export sales.\n\nIn 2023, it produced 16.7 million tons of coal, generating $3.5 billion in revenue and $863.1 million in operating income. While this was down significantly from 2022, it still had an operating margin of nearly 25%.\n\nAs demand picks up, profits will also increase.\n\nIt trades at 10.1x its 2024 earnings-per-share estimate of $28.29 and 8.3x its 2025 EPS of $34.27.\n\nAtkore (ATKR) hard hats hung up at a construction site symbolizing safety, labor and construction. Safe stocks to buy.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtkore (NYSE:ATKR) lost 11.37% over the past week. That puts down over 4% for 2024 but is still up 26% over the past year.\n\nAtkore makes electrical, mechanical, safety, and infrastructure products and solutions for nearly every type of construction application, from maintenance to entirely new structures.\n\nLike many industrial companies, its sales have slowed in 2024 due to a return to more historically average product prices. As a result, its gross margin in Q2 2024 was 36.8%, 260 basis points lower than a year earlier. That reduced its adjusted EBITDA by 23.2% to $211.9 million, or 26.7% of its quarterly revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor all of 2024, it expects adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS of $875 million and $16.50, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA will have fallen by 35% by the end of 2024 from $1.34 billion at the end of 2022, while its two-year decline in adjusted EPS is projected to be 23% lower than $21.50 a share at the end of 2022.\n\nInterestingly, despite a market cap nearing $6 billion, only five analysts cover its stock. Four of the five rate it a buy with a target price of $190, 22% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nIt\u2019s a diamond in the rough.\n\nBuilders FirstSource (BLDR) two construction workers on a worksite\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBuilders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) lost 14.73% over the past week. That leaves it up 1% for 2024 and 44% over the past year.\n\nThe company is one of the top suppliers of building materials in the U.S., with 570 distribution and manufacturing locations across 43 states. I first recommended BLDR stock in January 2022. Its business was so strong it had the opportunity to double in the year ahead. It failed to do so, more than making up for it in 2023, gaining 157%.\n\nIt\u2019s possible 2024 could be another down year, with the economy returning to gains in 2025 when interest rates fall and new construction accelerates.\n\nThe company recently reported its Q1 2024 results. It beat the top and bottom lines with revenue of $3.89 billion, $67 million higher than the estimate, and EPS of $2.65, 35 cents higher than the consensus.\u00a0 Unfortunately, investors were disappointed in the results. Its shares fell 17% on the news.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make any sense to me, given it reiterated its 2024 revenue guidance of $18.0 billion at the midpoint, 5.3% higher than in 2023. However, it does project an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.5%, 250 basis points less than in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s a sign the construction market overheated in 2022 and 2023. A return to more historical norms makes sense. Of the 16 analysts covering its stock, 11 rate it a buy, with a $205 target price, 23% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Growth Stock Down 33% to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "Despite many tech-focused enterprises putting up impressive returns in the past year and a half, they still remain well off their peak prices. This one booming business fits squarely into that category. Investors should therefore take a closer look at the opportunity.\n\nI'm talking about Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), which just reported what I thought was another strong quarter that benefited from healthy travel demand. Shares of this growth tech stock are currently 33% below their all-time high. Here's why it's a stock you should be buying hand over fist right now.\n\nRecent results\n\nLast year's robust demand trends have carried over into 2024. This is an encouraging sign, especially when you consider the state of the economy. Credit card debt is at record levels, and high interest rates and stubborn inflation have created an uncertain environment. Many retailers are expressing their struggles.\n\nBut this dynamic points to how consumer spending is leaning toward experiences nowadays, as opposed to goods that we saw during the pandemic. Airbnb benefits from this trend.\n\nIt posted revenue growth of 18% in Q1, thanks to gross bookings of $22.9 billion. There were 132.6 million nights and experiences booked on the platform in the last three months, which was up almost 10% year over year. Management called out the solar eclipse in early April as a unique event that helped support reservations in the current quarter.\n\nRevenue beat Wall Street estimates. So did the bottom line. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.41. That was more than double the figure for Q1 2023.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThis positive report didn't prevent the stock from immediately dropping 7% following the news. Investors probably weren't pleased that executives forecast Q2 revenue to be between $2.68 billion and $2.74 billion, which at the midpoint was below Wall Street's consensus analyst estimate. Management guidance would still represent 8.4% growth (at the midpoint) from the second quarter last year.\n\nThe momentum is set to continue. In the latest quarter, it was reported that Airbnb saw a 60% jump in app downloads compared to the year-ago quarter. In my opinion, this clearly shows the heightened interest in not only travel, but in Airbnb's platform. This could be a leading indicator of favorable financial results in the foreseeable future.\n\nValuation and quality\n\nAirbnb is a business that is performing extremely well right now. But you wouldn't be able to tell from the valuation. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 19.6. That's below that of the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis discount doesn't make sense to me. It's not a difficult argument to make when saying that Airbnb is an above-average business that deserves a premium valuation.\n\nGrowth is strong, of course. But we can't ignore how profitable the company is either. After generating $3.8 billion of free cash flow in 2023, Airbnb raked in $1.9 billion in just the last three months. That's hard to argue with. It's something that greatly reduces financial risk for investors -- something that can't be said for many growth-oriented companies.\n\nIt proves that this is now a scaled global platform that should see outsized profitability in the years ahead. Because Airbnb doesn't invest in properties itself, it operates a lucrative asset-light business model. And this explains why the cash register is ringing.\n\nSince its founding in 2008, Airbnb has become a well-known global brand in the travel sector. It's becoming a top choice for consumers who are looking to start making their travel plans. Plus, with the benefit of powerful network effects, there's minimal threat that Airbnb will be disrupted anytime soon.\n\nInvestors shouldn't think twice: It's best to take advantage of this opportunity and buy the stock on the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Airbnb right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Airbnb, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Airbnb wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ABNB) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?",
        "content": "With its stock down 8.2% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Airbnb's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Airbnb is:\n\n63% = US$4.9b \u00f7 US$7.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.63 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Airbnb's Earnings Growth And 63% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Airbnb has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Airbnb's considerable five year net income growth of 79% was to be expected.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Airbnb's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 24% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ABNB fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Airbnb Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Airbnb doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Airbnb's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "title": "Last Call! 3 Growth Stocks Poised to Soar After Earnings Dip",
        "content": "This earnings season broke some investors\u2019 hearts, even for the firms that actually reportedly have handsome top- and bottom-line beats. Indeed, quarterly earnings are much more than how the numbers stack up against analyst estimates. Though beating or missing the consensus is often enough to fuel a sizeable move in either direction for shares, full-year and the next quarter\u2019s guidance also plays a big role.\n\nHeck, you could argue that the guide has played a bigger role in dictating the trajectory of stock over the past few weeks. Of course, one must also consider the impact of a stock\u2019s valuation multiples going into a quarter. It\u2019s too high a bar, and you could be looking at a rough reaction, regardless of how awesome the numbers came in.\n\nThis piece will look at three stocks I believe have great value after their post-earning stumbles. While the quarters have ranged from mildly disappointing to \u201cjust not enough to garner enthusiasm,\u201d I view the following as worth watching, perhaps even nibbling at on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhether the post-earnings dip represents a timely \u201clast call\u201d ahead of closing time remains to be seen. There are no guarantees in the investment world, after all!\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) A black circle displaying a white EA logo is seen on top of black rectangular tiles.\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of the $33.8 billion video game juggernaut Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) fell under pressure last week as it stumbled past its quarterly earnings. Not only was EA\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter unimpressive (earnings per share fell well short of expectations), but the fiscal 2025 guide came in a tad on the light side.\n\nInvestors punished EA stock accordingly, with shares now down close to 3% prior to its big reveal. It\u2019s a modest plunge, but one that I believe is more than buyable or, at the very least, worth stashing on your radar. Though there was no sugar-coating Q4, I think the rough patch is forgivable, as there wasn\u2019t a massive new title to drive sales for the quarter. Indeed, the mid-spring tends to be a rather seasonally weak period of EA, anyway.\n\nIts sports franchises (think Madden, EA Sports FC and NHL) tend to kick off with new releases in late summer and early autumn. In the meantime, EA must continue investing heavily in its growth pipeline and in new content to support its current slate of live-service titles. Though less timely, I view EA stock as an intriguing buy while it\u2019s going for 27.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares stumbled after they reported last week. It was an ugly drop following first-quarter numbers that actually topped Wall Street estimates on the bottom line. In any case, investors didn\u2019t forgive the decent showing as revenue guidance (now calling for 8-10% for the second quarter) came up just a bit short.\n\nStory continues\n\nABNB stock shed more than 6% in the following sessions before recovering modestly after that. Today, ABNB shares are off over 11% from 52-week highs and around 30% from its 2020 all-time highs. I\u2019d argue that the latest correction is overdone for such a differentiated company that offers unique lodging experiences, especially given the more intriguing long-term roadmap.\n\nOver the long term, Airbnb will have plenty of room to expand internationally. Further, there\u2019s room to evolve into a more \u201ccross-vertical\u201d company. At 19.9 times trailing P/E, ABNB stock may very well be a bargain right here.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

Sure, the early bounce-back gains have already been made by investors who jumped in immediately after the number caused considerable selling activity. Still, META stock is a great AI play at below $470 per share.\n\nFurther, renewed fears over AI spending concerns may just drag shares lower again over the coming weeks should the dip-buyers grow exhausted. Either way, such big bets, I believe, make Meta stand out as a top-five, maybe even top-three AI stock to own for the next five years. Could such AI firepower make the current 26.9 times trailing P/E a tad too depressed? I believe so.\n\nThe only thing that may have investors on pause is the less-than-appealing technical picture. Indeed, it certainly looks like META stock is close to rolling over here. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to act on even lower prices if it does.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock is down 1.1% to trade at $147.53 at last check, as the shares continue to struggle following a negative post-earnings reaction earlier this month. In fact, over the last week of trading, the equity has shed 7.5%. The $146 level is keeping the stock in check, however, and this latest pullback could have bullish implications.\n\nAccording to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Airbnb stockis within one standard deviation of its 126-day moving average, which was a bullish trendline in the past. The equity saw at least five similar signals over the last three years, defined for this study as having traded north of the moving average 80% of the time in the past two months and in eight of the last 10 trading days.\n\nThe shares finished higher one month later in 80% of those instances, with an average 5.5% gain. A move of similar magnitude from ABNB's current perch would put it at $155.75 within the next 21 days, clearing the post-earnings bear gap on the charts. ABNB Chart May 142024\n\nDespite a 39.9% year-over-year lead and a slimmer 8.7% year-to-date gain, the majority of analysts are bearish on Airbnb stock. Of the 36 in coverage, 25 brokerages rate the equity a \"hold\" or worse, and an unwinding of this pessimism could provide some much needed tailwinds.\n\nNow looks like the right time to speculate with options, as the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 29% sits in the low 2nd percentile of readings from the past year. This indicates options traders are now pricing in lower-than-usual volatility expectations.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned -8.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Airbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.94 per share, indicating a change of -4.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.64 points to a change of -35.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.29 indicates a change of +14% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Airbnb is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ABNB _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.21 billion and $12.55 billion estimates indicate +13% and +11.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.14 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $0.41 for the same period compares with $0.18 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.66%. The EPS surprise was +78.26%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Airbnb, Inc. ABNB. This is because this security in the Internet - Content space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.\n\nThis is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Internet - Content space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 51 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbnb is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm\u2019s prospects in both the short and long term.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. Price and Consensus Airbnb, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAirbnb, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Airbnb, Inc. Quote\n\nIn fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from 92 cents per share to 94 cents per share, while current year estimates have risen from $4.34 per share to $4.64 per share. This has helped ABNB to earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), further underscoring the company\u2019s solid position. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Airbnb. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at 10 countries with the best architecture in Africa. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of African architecture, you can directly go to 5 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa.\n\nSignificance of African Architecture\n\nAfrican architecture is worth evaluating for a unique characteristic: a particular influence of climate and cultural influences on the way buildings are designed. A key example is the use of stone in both ancient and modern structures, as it is one of the most durable building materials available. Historically, traditional African architecture has kept in view the unique needs of the area\u2019s residents.\n\nA study on this subject was published in 2021 by Barabara Widera, an instructor of architecture from the Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology in Poland. The study found that during the hot season, 60-70% of the inhabitants of traditional dwellings found their homes to be thermally comfortable. However, in \u2018modern houses,\u2019 only 20% of inhabitants reported such comfort. During the cold seasons, comfort was reported by 90% of the inhabitants in traditional houses and only 50% of those who lived in modern housing.\n\nThe study identified four typographies of traditional houses, which had similar features across several African countries. The strategies that helped regulate the temperature within these dwellings included: thick mud brick walls to accumulate heat, small doors and a lack of windows to prevent heat from entering the home, and sustainable thatched roofs that provided adequate protection from the rain.\n\nImportant Architectural Buildings in Africa\n\nAfrica has several countries with the best architecture in the world, which is showcased by the region\u2019s widely famous buildings.\u00a0 In 2021, BBC reported instances of iconic African architecture, as detailed in the seven-volume series \u2018Sub-Saharan Africa: Architectural Guide.\u2019 Examples included the Kasubi Tombs in Uganda, which were built in 1882. The Tombs serve as the burial grounds for members of the Baganda royal family, which makes it a significant site for the locals. The Guide notes that the interior has been made to resemble a sacred forest, having been topped by 52 circular rings. Each ring represents one of the 52 Buganda clans of the region.\n\nSince the construction pre-dates the introduction of modern materials, the tombs heavily utilize traditional materials such as spear grass, wooden poles, and reeds. In 2001, UNESCO reported that the Tombs had been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2010, a fire caused heavy destruction to the place, following which UNESCO added it to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. The Kasubi Tombs were taken off the danger list in 2023. According to a report by TRT Afrika, the Tombs receive around 30,000 visitors annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe BBC report also highlights the Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9 in Mali, which was built in the 13th century. According to the Guide, at a height of 52 feet, this mosque is the largest earth-built structure in the world. The construction has been done using sun-baked earth bricks and a coat of plaster along with sand and earth-based mortar. In 1988, UNESCO recognized the entire area of the Old Towns of Djenn\u00e9 as one of its Heritage Sites. The place was added to the List of Heritage Sites in Danger in 2016, where it still remains. Factors affecting the site in 2016 were civil unrest, housing issues, and land management. From 1981 to 2020, UNESCO approved seven requests of international assistance for the protection of the property, totaling $115,119 in funds.\n\nTourism in Africa - Pre and Post-Pandemic Levels\n\nThriving architecture is one of the factors attracting tourists to a particular country. The phenomenon has been referred to as \u2018architourism\u2019 in academic circles. The relevance of architecture to tourism is pertinent to discuss here because tourism is a major industry in the African continent. According to a report by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), tourism contributed $186 billion to the African economy in 2019. A total of 84 million international travelers made their way to the continent that year. According to another report by Brookings, Africa had the world\u2019s second-fastest-growing tourism sector before the pandemic. The industry represented 8.5% of the continent\u2019s total GDP, employing 24 million people. Tourism-related employment was especially prominent in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, where the travel sector employed 8.4% and 9.2% of the total workforce, respectively.\n\nHowever, the pandemic caused significant losses for the industry. From April to June 2020, the influx of international travelers in the region fell by 98%. Tourism-dependent economies such as Mauritius and Seychelles reported a sharp decline in economic growth, 14.9% and 12% respectively. In September 2020,\u00a0 a study was published by educators from the University of Calabar, Nigeria. The study estimated that Africa was set to lose some 7.6 million tourism-related jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNevertheless, Africa has managed to bounce back from the losses. On January 31, 2024, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) published a news issue on Africa. According to the report, by January 2024, international tourist arrivals to the continent had recovered to 96% of pre-pandemic levels. Certain sub-regions were even performing better than they were before the pandemic, such as North Africa, where tourist arrivals in 2023 were 8% higher than they were in 2019. An increase in tourist arrivals, as compared to pre-pandemic levels, was also seen in other countries such as Ethiopia (28%), Tanzania (19%), and Morocco (15%).\n\nThe report also revealed that from January to September 2023, Africa recovered 92% of pre-pandemic arrivals, while the global average was 84%. During these nine months, Africa was the world\u2019s second-best-performing region in tourism. Throughout 2022, the continent also managed to recover 84% of its pre-pandemic tourism-related earnings. The world average for this indicator was 74%. Several countries managed to exceed pre-pandemic earnings by a significant number, including Seychelles (59%), Algeria (56%), and Ethiopia (49%).\n\nFurthermore, in November 2023, WTTC reported that over the course of the next decade, the African tourism sector could add an additional $168 billion to the continent\u2019s economy, while also creating more than 18 million new jobs. Based on these findings, the upcoming years are expected to see further growth in the tourism sector of Africa.\n\nMaking Tourism Possible\n\nAs international arrivals in Africa continue increasing, whether for architourism or cultural tourism, several companies are playing a huge role in accommodating these travelers, such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). On October 24, 2023, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported that it had pledged $500,000 to support sustainable tourism in Africa. The company also announced that it plans to expand its Entrepreneurship Academy to five new countries in Africa. The Academy is a development program that helps individuals from underrepresented communities to become hosts through the Airbnb platform. In 2022, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) contributed around $1.2 billion to the South African economy, supporting almost 50,000 jobs in the country.\n\nTripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) is another company that proves to be beneficial for tourists in Africa as it can be utilized to look up the most popular architectural monuments in the region. The online platform has around 12 million reviews for attractions and hotels in Africa, making it one of the best resources for tourism. African destinations have also earned awards from Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) for years. In 2022, Shadows of Africa, a safari operator in East Africa, announced that the company had won Tripadvisor, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TRIP) Travelers\u2019 Choice Awards for nine years in a row.\n\nAs architourism continues rising and the tourism industry in Africa booms, here are 10 countries with the best architecture in Africa that you can plan to visit this year. You can also take a look at the Top 12 Companies for Architects in United States and the 15 Highest Paying Countries for Architects. 10 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa\n\n10 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile this list of the 10 countries with the best architecture in Africa, we adopted a consensus approach. First, we consulted ten rankings and reports on the internet, shortlisting countries that appeared in at least 50% of our sources. Then, we ranked the countries according to the number of tourists they received in 2022. Our hypothesis is that countries with good architecture will attract a high number of tourists. We sourced our tourism data from the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Further information is added from UNESCO, the BBC report on African architecture, and the 2021 study on African vernacular dwellings by Barbara Widera.\n\n10 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa\n\n10. Nigeria\n\nTourist Arrivals (2022): 0.53 Million\n\nWidera noted that Nigeria was home to the Dagomba huts, which are made with mud walls, thatched roofs, and just one small window. The homes protect inhabitants against the hot climate. Nigeria ranks tenth on our list of countries with the best architecture in Africa.\n\n9. Cabo Verde\n\nTourist Arrivals (2022): 0.79 Million\n\nCabo Verde, also known as Cape Verde, ranks ninth on our list of countries with the best architecture in Africa. The archipelago was first inhabited by Portuguese settlers, who left a huge impact on the region\u2019s architecture.\n\n8. Ethiopia\n\nTourist Arrivals (2022): 0.90 Million\n\nThe BBC report highlights Ethiopia\u2019s Lideta Market for its architectural style. Despite being a contemporary shopping center, the building was constructed keeping the unique needs of the region in view. The design is perforated which enables the flow of light and ventilation. The exterior also resembles a traditional Ethiopian fabric, adding further symphony between the architecture and the region.\n\n7. Ghana\n\nTourist Arrivals (2022): 0.92 Million\n\nGhana is home to all six architectural typologies noted by Widera in her research. Key characteristics of the architecture include rectangular-shaped huts made out of mud. Ghana ranks seventh on our list of African countries with the best architecture. Ghana is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n6. Mauritius\n\nTourist Arrivals (2022): 1.00 Million\n\nMauritius houses two UNESCO World Heritage sites and also ranks sixth on our list of countries with the best architecture in Africa. The country received around a million visitors in 2022, which was slightly lower than in 2019 when tourist arrivals equaled 1.38 million.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nTop 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley 25 Cities with Tallest Buildings in the World 20 Best Business Ideas for Solopreneurs in 2024\n\nDisclaimer: None. 10 Countries with the Best Architecture in Africa is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Airbnb's (NASDAQ: ABNB) first-quarter earnings report was fresh off the press on May 8. Despite solid beats on the top and bottom lines, investors sold the stock the following day as second-quarter guidance came up short. Shares lost 7%, a significant one-day sell-off for the travel leader.\n\nRevenue increased 18% year over year to $2.14 billion last quarter, ahead of the $2.06 billion consensus, while earnings per share more than doubled from $0.18 to $0.41, far exceeding the analyst estimate of $0.24. The surge in profit margins was due in part to a shift in the Easter holiday to the first quarter, strong interest income, and leverage from its revenue growth and cost discipline.\n\nWhile those results should've pleased the market, investors instead focused on the second-quarter guidance, which called for revenue growth to slow to 8% to 10% as the shift in Easter turns into a headwind. That slowdown seems to be temporary, though, as management said revenue growth would accelerate in the third quarter as the company benefits from events like the Summer Olympics and the Euro Cup.\n\nThe stock is now down 13% from its year-to-date peak and at its lowest point in close to three months. That sets up an appealing buying opportunity as Airbnb still has a long growth path in front of it.\n\nLet's take a look at a few reasons to buy the dip in Airbnb stock. Image source: Airbnb.\n\nAirbnb is gaining market share\n\nAirbnb competes with hotels and other types of overnight accommodations, but its closest competitors are other home-sharing platforms like Expedia's VRBO.\n\nBut Airbnb already dominates the home-sharing niche with a leading market share among those platforms, and the company appeared to strengthen its position in the first quarter. Revenue at Expedia increased 8% in the period, while its B2C division that includes VRBO was up just 3%. Overall lodging gross booking rose 4%. Expedia doesn't break out VRBO results, but it noted headwinds with the replatforming of VRBO as it shifts the brand under the Expedia umbrella where users will be able to take advantage of Expedia Rewards.\n\nCompetitors have been unable to overcome the powerful network effect present on Airbnb's platform, allowing it to continue growing its lead.\n\nThe platform gets creative with Icons\n\nIn its summer update, Airbnb introduced one of its most original ideas yet, which it's calling Icons. The company is giving travelers the opportunity to stay in iconic places around the world and have truly unique experiences like a night at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, or a stay in the house from Pixar's hit movie Up.\n\nStory continues\n\nIcons are yet another way that Airbnb is differentiating itself from hotels and other home-sharing platforms. These aspirational experiences will elevate and reinforce Airbnb's brand in travel and create buzz around its unique offerings.\n\nAs CEO Brian Chesky has said, Airbnb is committed to expanding beyond the core business, so investors should expect more of these new features in the future.\n\nMaking smart financial decisions\n\nAirbnb is a growth stock, but after being chastened by the pandemic, management runs the business much more conservatively than many of its Silicon Valley peers, and is making prudent financial decisions and controlling spending.\n\nThe company continues to return capital to shareholders, buying back $750 million in stock last quarter. With $2.5 billion in total share repurchases over the past year, Airbnb has reduced its shares outstanding nearly 3% over that period. While 3% might not sound like much, this strategy compounds over time, and Airbnb should be able to increase buybacks as profits grow.\n\nAdditionally, the company is benefiting from higher interest rates as it's on track to generate close to $1 billion in interest income this year, giving it a significant boost on the bottom line.\n\nThis top growth stock is executing as a business and taking advantage of its superior financial position, and that will reward investors over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Airbnb right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Airbnb, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Airbnb wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. Just Beat EPS By 77%: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "As you might know, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) just kicked off its latest first-quarter results with some very strong numbers. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 3.9% to hit US$2.1b. Airbnb also reported a statutory profit of US$0.41, which was an impressive 77% above what the analysts had forecast. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Airbnb after the latest results.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Airbnb's 37 analysts is for revenues of US$11.2b in 2024. This reflects a solid 9.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to plummet 42% to US$4.50 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$11.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.32 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Airbnb's earnings potential following these results.\n\nThe consensus price target was unchanged at US$152, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Airbnb analyst has a price target of US$200 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$80.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Airbnb's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 12% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 29% p.a. growth over the last three years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 9.7% per year. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Airbnb is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Airbnb's earnings potential next year. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$152, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) saw a 1.4% increase.\n\nElsewhere, the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged, while flagging rising chances of imminent rate cuts as new inflation projections reveal that price pressures will fall below target in two years.\n\nThursday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,063.88 0.5% Dow Jones 39,198.18 0.4% S&P 500 5,193.92 0.1% Nasdaq 100 18,059.03 -0.1%\n\nUpdated at 1.00 p.m. EDT\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) rose 0.2% to $518.53, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.5% to $392.26 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was unchanged at $440.08, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) outperformed, up 1.7%, followed by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), up 0.8%.

        "content": "Why Airbnb (ABNB) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of online accommodations platform Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) fell 9.5% in the morning session after the company reported first-quarter results. It provided revenue guidance for the next quarter below analysts' expectations, and its revenue growth slowed. On the other hand, Airbnb beat analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations. It also expanded its number of bookings. Overall, this was a mixed quarter for Airbnb.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Airbnb? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nAirbnb's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 12 months ago, when the company dropped 10.6% on the news that the company reported first quarter results that beat analysts' gross bookings, revenue, earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow estimates. However, room nights, revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the next quarter came in below Consensus, with the weak EBITDA guidance attributed to \"changes in the expected timing of marketing spend relative to the prior year.\"\n\nAdditionally, full-year 2023 EBITDA margin will be similar to 2022, which is slightly below expectations and shows that the company will not be getting operating leverage on expenses this year. Overall, it was a negative quarter for the company given the outlook for the business.\n\nAirbnb is up 9.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $147.26 per share it is still trading 12.4% below its 52-week high of $168.18 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Airbnb's shares at the IPO in December 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,018.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "In the late 1970s, Louis Navellier \u2013 then a college student, now a senior analyst at InvestorPlace \u2013 accidentally beat the market. By running financial data through a Wells Fargo mainframe computer (an enormous privilege at the time!), he came across a model that beat the S&P 500 by a considerable margin.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s developed his system into Portfolio Grader, a quantitative stock-picking system that has trounced the market. It\u2019s found picks like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at $6\u2026 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at under $1\u2026\n\nIn fact, every dollar invested in Louis\u2019s A-graded stocks in 1998 would have risen fiftyfold by 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese quantitative systems are generally focused on finding stocks for the long run. We\u2019re not asking these systems to predict what\u2019s going to happen next week\u2026 let alone the next 24 hours.\n\nAnd that matters. Especially if you\u2019re an options trader\u2026 active investor\u2026 or even a long-term buyer seeking a better entry price. In these cases, it\u2019s essential to know when stocks will rise (and not just which ones).\n\nThat\u2019s where AI trading systems like TradeSmith\u2019s Predictive Alpha come in. These systems analyze hundreds of technical aspects, scouring share prices and volume metrics for \u201cclues\u201d of trader intent. (If you\u2019re a $10 billion fund selling $100 million of stock in a company that only has $50 million of average turnover a day\u2026 you\u2019re going to influence prices no matter what.)\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited this week to introduce Jonathan Rose, a veteran trader who has mastered the ins and outs of these types of trades. In his latest Masters in Trading presentation, he outlines the strategies, indicators, and other market clues he uses to notch returns of 197%\u2026 317%\u2026 even 1,147% in 30 days or less.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019d like to leave you with five tactical picks from TradeSmith\u2019s Predictive Alpha system that our writers at InvestorPlace.com \u2013 our free news and analysis site \u2013 also have highlighted this week.\n\nThese are five companies we expect will do well over the next 30 days, which makes them the ideal \u201cbuy the dip\u201d stocks for a recovering market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTradeSmith\u2019s Predictive Alpha ranks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its top pick this week, projecting a 3.6% return over the next 30 days. (That translates to a 52% annualized rate thanks to compounding). The quantitative system sees Nvidia\u2019s recent 15% selloff as overdone.\n\nIt\u2019s admittedly been difficult for investors to stomach Nvidia\u2019s sky-high prices. Even though my own models project that shares could be worth $1,600 by 2027, the company\u2019s eyewatering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios make it seem like an enormous bet on a future that may never arrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, Nvidia\u2019s recent pullback now puts prices back into more \u201cnormal\u201d territory. Shares now trade at 25 times 2026 earnings \u2013 not far from the average S&P 500 firm. And Ian Cooper writes at InvestorPlace.com that these lower prices present a compelling buying opportunity:\n\nNvidia could see even more upside with the AI and metaverse boom. After climbing to a high of $967.66, it\u2019s now back to $830.41. This weakness could be a long-term opportunity. From that last traded price, I\u2019d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.\n\nStrong results from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are also making a bullish case. Last Thursday, the smartphone chipmaker announced that earnings had surged 37% to $2.3 billion, driven by record automotive revenues and strong AI demand. This comes as a stark contrast to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, which had previously announced worse-than-expected Q1 results.\n\nThat tells us that the \u201cAI chip slowdown\u201d seen by some Nvidia rivals are company-specific issues. Nvidia itself continues to score a top A grade in Louis\u2019s Portfolio Grader, and rising analyst earnings estimates suggests that a near-term recovery will soon be underway.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPredictive Alpha similarly rates Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as a perfect \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d stock. The system forecasts a 3.1% upside over the next month.\n\nIn short, investors have become increasingly pessimistic about how much Meta will have to invest in data centers and AI \u2013 capital-intensive projects that will yield few immediate results. Wall Street analysts have quietly trimmed their target prices by $5 since last month.\n\nHowever, Meta is now seeing a surge in its core advertising business, with ad volume growth outpacing user growth almost threefold. As Yiannis Zourmpanos puts it in an article on InvestorPlace.com:\n\nA 6% increase in the average price per ad YOY suggests that Meta\u2019s advertising platform is now more efficiently monetized\u2026\n\nLooking forward, Meta will continue to expand its income by investing in data analytics, ad targeting skills, and advertising technologies. Therefore, ad impressions and average ad pricing will continue to rise due to the company\u2019s emphasis on increasing user engagement, growing the ad inventory, and boosting ad relevancy.\n\nElection years are typically excellent periods for advertisers, and we\u2019re seeing old patterns play out at Meta Platforms.\n\nEven better, Meta\u2019s stock currently trades for just 22 times forward earnings, making it one of the cheapest \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock by that metric. Though Wall Street might seem bearish about Meta\u2019s near-term prospects, our quant systems suggest the selloff has now gone too far.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn April, InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Marc Guberti highlighted Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) as a stock to buy whenever the market falters:\n\nRising profit margins and a solid moat are strengthening the company\u2019s long-term prospects. Analysts are bullish on the stock and rated it as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests an 11% upside.\n\nEssentially, Intuit is an \u201cevergreen\u201d stock that tends to make money in both good times and bad. Over the past three recessions, Intuit saw revenues rise double digits as consumers traded down for cheaper online accounting services. And during good times, Intuit also does well as small businesses migrate from pen-and-paper bookkeeping to digitized services like QuickBooks.\n\nA recent selloff in tech stocks now provides us with that market \u201cfalter\u201d we\u2019ve been waiting for. Shares of Intuit have now fallen 8% from their peak, which puts it near the top of Predictive Alpha\u2019s list. The quantitative stock-picking system believes shares will recover 3.1% over the next 30 days.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce strong results on May 23. The IRS only began accepting returns on Jan. 29 this year, and so much of Intuit\u2019s early season tax business will be pushed into its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expect revenues to rise 9% to $6.6 billion, and for earnings per share to surge 10% to $9.36. These are phenomenal growth rates for a mature blue-chip firm.\n\nIntuit also earns a high score in both Portfolio Grader (where it scores a \u201cB\u201d), signaling long-term gains to come. The firm is highly profitable and fast-growing, and its recent decline in short interest suggests that bears are beginning to throw in the towel. That makes the tax software firm a rarity: a stock that\u2019s attractive to both short- and long-term investors.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Tuesday, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and a host of other large brands warned that consumers were \u201cstarting to crack.\u201d Rising inflation and dwindling savings have begun to impact demand. Starbucks (NYSE:SBUX) also has felt the pinch \u2013 same-store-sales declined 3% in Q2.\n\nThat perhaps makes Target (NYSE:TGT) the strangest short-term pick by Predictive Alpha this week. Shares of the retailer are expected to rise 3.1% over the next 30 days, bucking a broader trend of negative consumer news.\n\nThere are several reasons for optimism. As Josh Enomoto notes at InvestorPlace.com, Target is more rock-solid than most realize:\n\nA big-box retailer, Target may face pressure amid the broader economic anxieties. However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco.\n\nSecond, Target is also better shielded from the yo-yo demand that has put firms like Starbucks on the defensive. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target, and as the saying goes, \u201cwe\u2019ve all got to eat.\u201d\n\nFinally, InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Will Ashworth writes that Target is one of the few firms that has added significant headcount over the past five years and maintained strong returns on invested capital. It\u2019s a faster-growing firm than most realize, and Ashworth previously recommended shares as a bargain buy when TGT traded at around $126.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) A hand holds up the Airbnb (ABNB) logo outside a home in Estonia.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Predictive Alpha highlights Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) this week for its 3% expected return over the next 30 days, a 43% annualized rate of return.\n\nShares of Airbnb are only slightly higher today than when it first went public in 2020. The novelty of home rentals has worn off, and the firm has only managed to meet sky-high IPO expectations, not exceed them.\n\nHowever, this flattish long-term performance masks some incredible moves in Airbnb\u2019s stock. In April 2022, a delayed Covid-19 exit sent shares plummeting 40%. A recovery in tech stocks and consumer demand has since reversed that loss.\n\nJeremy Flint, as he writes at InvestorPlace.com, now believes a bookings boom is set to put Airbnb back on a faster track of growth:\n\nAirbnb\u2019s user base is returning to the platform\u2019s original concept of offering spare space as a budget-friendly alternative to hotels. Despite facing significant challenges, such as a $10 million fine for misleading international customers by listing prices in USD rather than local currencies, Airbnb\u2019s market dominance remains unchallenged\u2026\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Airbnb disclosed nearly a 17% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 15% rise in gross booking value. Spurred by the holiday travel surge, this growth is expected to continue as we move into the spring and summer travel seasons.\n\nSince September, Airbnb has seen the number of shares sold short decline from 34.8 million to just 16.6 million \u2013 a 52% drop.\n\nStocks for the Long Short Run\n\nIn 1994, economist Jeremy Siegel published Stocks for the Long Run, an investment tome that was often referred to as \u201cthe buy and hold Bible.\u201d By investing in the U.S. stock market and holding on for extended periods, even ordinary investors could turn small investments into vast fortunes.\n\nHowever, critics have since pointed out that not every investor has a 40-plus year investment horizon. Some might not even have five years. And the incredible run that U.S. stock markets saw in the 20th century might fail to repeat in modern times. America, after all, saw its economy move from a middling one to the world\u2019s greatest superpower during this period. (Buy-and-hold investors in Turkey, Argentina, and China have done far worse).\n\nThat means investing in the 21st century will need some combination of long-term investing paired with tactical trading. Nvidia might be a phenomenal long-term stock\u2026 but is $700 a good entry price? $800? $1,000?\n\nThat\u2019s where Jonathan Rose\u2019s Masters in Trading Summit comes in. In this video event, he shares how to analyze short-term market moves and detect signals that long-term stock-picking algorithms might otherwise miss. And he\u2019s giving this presentation away for free to InvestorPlace.com readers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held no positions in stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Airbnb Inc. shares were set to slide by the most in a year after the home-rental company gave lackluster guidance for a second straight quarter, indicating that growth in travel spending will slow ahead of the peak summer season.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings Americans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track Arm Slides as Tepid Outlook Fuels Concerns Over AI Slowdown Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump\u2019s Demeanor\n\nRevenue for the current quarter ending in June will be $2.68 billion to $2.74 billion, the company said Wednesday in a letter to shareholders. Analysts had been expecting $2.74 billion. In its statement, Airbnb blamed the earlier timing of the 2024 Easter holiday, as well as currency headwinds.\n\nThe stock was down 8.5% in premarket trading, set to notch its biggest drop since May 10, 2023, if the declines hold.\n\nAirbnb and its rivals have been working to establish a new normal since the world emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. The industry\u2019s recovery has been choppy, with demand growing faster in some regions and tapering off in others due to the different pace of reopening from lockdowns. Last week, Booking Holdings Inc. gave worse-than-expected guidance and Expedia Group Inc. issued disappointing results.\n\nAirbnb, which specializes in shared homes and vacation rentals both in urban cities and rural destinations, saw a deceleration in North American nights booked in the first quarter. It has been making an effort through its marketing to differentiate its rentals from hotels in the hopes that people traveling in groups will opt to rent homes with multiple bedrooms. The company said that bookings for groups of six or more people were the fastest growing segment in the region.\n\nGrowth in the current period for nights and experiences booked \u2014 a key industry metric \u2014 will be \u201crelatively stable\u201d compared with the 9.5% gain it posted in the first quarter. That falls short of analysts\u2019 expectations for a roughly 12% increase. It also represents the slowest rate of growth since 2020, suggesting that overall demand has normalized after an initial post-pandemic travel boom.\n\nThe outlook overshadowed an otherwise better-than-expected report for the first quarter, which saw revenue surpass estimates, growing 18% to $2.14 billion thanks to particularly strong gains in Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe company is expecting revenue growth to re-accelerate in the third quarter, as key international events like the summer Olympics in Paris and the Euro Cup in Germany are fueling travel demand in the peak summer season.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe continued recovery in international travel has been a bright spot for the travel industry including Airbnb, whose businesses in Latin America and Asia have seen faster growth than in the US. It has also been investing more into less mature markets in those regions to drive near-term gains, including the introduction of limited-edition stays inspired by local cultural icons.\n\nChief Executive Officer Brian Chesky has said that the company he co-founded in 2007 is ready to expand beyond its core product after spending the past year refining existing offerings. In particular, the company has been focused on making listings more reliable and affordable for guests, as well as encouraging more people to host.\n\nThat work has been paying off. The number of active listings in the first quarter grew 15% year-over-year and supply has continued to grow at a double-digit pace across all regions. That\u2019s in spite of the company removing thousands of listings in the first quarter that did not meet guest expectations.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts looking for new, non-core products to drive revenue growth may have to wait a bit longer. Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson has signaled that additional ventures could include a different type of marketplace on Airbnb later this year or next, which will offer cleaning and maintenance services, airport rides, or even private chef or sommelier sessions. Chesky has also said he will share more details on the company\u2019s use of artificial intelligence later this year.\n\n(Updates the share price in the third paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Airbnb shares tumbled more than 8% premarket on Thursday after weak forecasts for the second quarter stoked investor fears about slowing growth at the vacation rental firm and took the shine off a strong quarterly profit beat.\n\nThe Easter holiday occurring in the first quarter rather than the second and currency-exchange impacts were partly to blame for Airbnb projecting current-quarter revenue below lofty Wall Street estimates.\n\nIt also forecast the growth rate of room nights booked would be relatively flat on a sequential basis, but the company's average daily rate is expected to be modestly higher year-over-year.\n\nModerating leisure travel demand in the U.S. has also been a concern for investors.\n\n\"Airbnb failed to deliver a beat/raise on nights, which we believe was necessary to ease concerns about slowing growth and risk of downside to consensus estimates for accelerating growth in (the second half of 2024 and in 2025),\" Jefferies analysts said.\n\nAccording to BTIG analysts, Airbnb's forecast implied nights booked of about 125 million to 127 million in the second quarter. That compared with consensus estimates of 129.2 million, LSEG data showed.\n\n\"While Airbnb topped the Q1 guide, it was shy of more aggressive buyside expectations in the quarter and the Q2 outlook,\" BTIG's Jake Fuller wrote in a client note.\n\nShares of Airbnb, which have gained 16% so far this year, were trading at $144.49 before the bell.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. \r\nI will now hand the call over to Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAngela Yang\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's First Quarter of 2024 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Ellie Mertz. \r\nEarlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2024. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. \r\nAlso, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. \r\nWith that, I will pass the call to Brian.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAll right. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining. Airbnb had a strong start to 2024. We had 133 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q1, marking our highest first quarter ever. Revenue of $2.1 billion grew 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued strength in travel demand and the timing of Easter. Net income was $264 million, representing a net income margin of 12%. \r\nFor Q1, our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, our highest ever. And for the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow was $4.2 billion, representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. Our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the quarter. And as of the end of Q1, we had $6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. \r\nNow during Q1, we made significant progress across our 3 strategic initiatives, which are making hosting mainstream, perfecting our core service and expanding beyond the core. First, we're maybe hosting mainstream. We remain focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling in Airbnb. And to do this, we're raising awareness around the benefits of hosting, providing better tools and helping hosts deliver high-quality stays. As we grow, we're also taking action to rapidly improve the quality stays on Airbnb. In Q1, we removed thousands of listings that failed to meet our guest expectations. And excluding these removals, active listings for accommodations grew 17% year-over-year. And we also saw sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions. This year, we'll continue to raise awareness around hosting and improve the overall host experience. \r\nSecond, we are perfecting our core service. Over the past few years, we've rolled out more than 430 new features and upgrades to improve our service. In November, we took another huge step forward on reliability with the launch of Guest Favorites, a collection of the top homes on Airbnb based on ratings, reviews and reliability. Now since launching Guest Favorites, there have been more than 100 million nights booked at these listings, and we will continue to make it easier for guests to find high-quality and affordable stays.\r\nFinally, we're expanding beyond our core. During the quarter, we continued investing in less mature markets to unlock more growth. And in Q1, gross nights booked in our expansion markets grew twice as fast as our core markets. And we're also focused on expanding beyond our core business. Now this will be a multiyear journey, and we've already begun laying the foundation. Last week, we introduced Icons, a new category of extraordinary experiences by the greatest names in music, film, sports and more. Icons mark an important next step in helping people understand that Airbnb offers more than just travel accommodations. \r\nNow before I share a few business highlights, I just want to provide some context on why we actually introduced Icons because they deliver on 3 key objectives. First, Icons keep Airbnb's brand relevant and top of mind. With new Icons launching throughout the year, we can introduce more people to Airbnb and highlight what makes us unique. Second, while Airbnb's brand is already recognized around the world, there are specific segments where we want to accelerate growth. And with a broad range of Icons spanning various geographies, demographics and fan bases, we'll be able to reach key segments in a more targeted way. And third, Icons help change the way people think about Airbnb and what we offer. And this is going to be critical as we expand beyond accommodations in the coming years. \r\nNow it's still early, but we're really excited about the response we've seen to Icons so far. In just one week, the Icons launch has generated over 8,100 pieces of global media coverage and 371 million social media impressions. And the coverage has been overwhelmingly positive. Now just to put this into perspective, Icons has already generated more press than our IPO. It's clear Icons is resonating with people. \r\nNow looking back to Q1, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, mobile downloads are accelerating. So to quickly zoom out, Nights and Experiences Booked in Q1 increased 9.5% year-over-year despite a hard comp this time last year. And we were particularly encouraged by the growth of app downloads. In the U.S., app downloads increased 60% in Q1 compared to a year ago. And global nights booked in our app increased 21% year-over-year, and they now represent 54% of nights booked during the quarter. And this time last year, mobile bookings represented only 49%. So it went from 49% to 54%. So we're seeing some really, really good traction. \r\nSecond, Airbnb is uniquely positioned for special events. Special events is really how we started Airbnb. We really started it to provide housing for conferences and events. And in April, we had over 500,000 guests stay on Airbnb during the solar eclipse in North America. And interestingly, we saw more than twice as many nights stayed on Airbnb along the direct path of the eclipse compared to the year prior with many of the locations in areas that don't even have hotels. Nights booked in Paris during the summer's Olympics are 5x higher than this time a year ago, and Germany is also seeing a similar trend for the Euro Cup this summer with nights book nearly double compared to a year ago.\r\nNow supplies also increased to meet the higher demand, including nearly 40% more active listings in Paris in Q1 compared to a year ago. These events highlight Airbnb's unique ability to disperse travel and spread economic benefits by allowing people to stay in local neighborhoods where there are no hotels. \r\nAnd finally, supply growth remains strong. Now as mentioned earlier, in Q1, we removed thousands of listings that failed to meet our guest expectations. And excluding these removals, active listings for accommodations grew 17% year-over-year. We continue to see double-digit supply growth across all regions with the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. Urban and nonurban supply increased at about the same rate, and we saw relatively similar supply growth among individual and professional hubs with the majority of new listings exclusive to Airbnb. We're really proud of our strong Q1 results, and we're looking forward to another record summer travel season. \r\nSo with that, Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\n\nYou talked about this kind of leaning into these kind of less mature markets and this doubling of growth rate in some of those expansion markets versus your core markets. Could you give a little more color on which countries and which markets that is, which countries? I think in the past, you may have mentioned Brazil. But which ones you're leaning into this year? And then secondly, that U.S. app downloads increase of 60% year-over-year. That's an extremely high number for what you would think would be a reasonably well-known app and brand. So what drove that? Do you have any whys behind that?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. Mark, why don't I start? So leaning into a less mature market. So if you think about Airbnb, we're obviously in 220 countries and regions. We're one of the most global brands in the world, but our more -- our markets with the highest penetration would be U.S., Canada, Australia, France and U.K. So those 5. So the next markets that have the biggest potential TAM would be -- I mean, would be like Mexico and Brazil in Latin America. In Europe, it would be Germany. It would be Italy. It would be Spain. We're also starting to see some traction in like Switzerland and Netherlands. And in Asia, it would be Japan. It would be Korea. It would be China, and eventually a little bit longer game would be India. So these are -- and there's a few others in Latin America. So I can kind of keep going. But those are kind of some of the really, really big travel TAMs. \r\nAnd Mark, maybe just one other thing I'll just say. Like I think a really think good thing to look at is our penetration for each country. And while U.S., Canada and Australia are really, really similar, there's a really, really big drop-off in a lot of these other markets that are huge travel TAMs, especially in Asia. And one of the things that we've learned is that Airbnb pretty much resonates pretty equally everywhere once there's the awareness. In fact, I could argue that Airbnb might resonate better in Asia because there's a younger travel population that's not predisposed to hotels, and they're on social media. And we are disproportionately on social media versus our competitors. So I'm very, very bullish about that.\r\nNow on U.S. app downloads, you're right. I mean it was -- it's grown 60% last year. It went from 49% of bookings to 54% of bookings. So at the highest level, Mark, what drove that was just focus on a road map. We have a brand that most everybody, at least in the United States, have heard us. And a lot of people download our app. But we've never really focused on optimizing our app from a download perspective. And just to be clear, these numbers were driven organically, not by paid advertising. \r\nSo it was really just a lot of optimization, different touch points, encouraging people at the right moment to download our app, not being intrusive. We had pushed a lot of people to just -- we just push them to our mobile website. Our mobile website does not convert nearly at the rate of our app download. \r\nAnd so maybe the highest level point I'll just make is I think what we've been able to prove in the last 3 years is we focus on something that can drive the numbers. Two years ago, supply wasn't growing. We focused on it. It's now growing 17% net quality. A year ago, we felt like app downloads weren't where they needed to be. We put a team on it. They focused. So I think we're developing a good track to really be able to move metrics when we focus on them.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nBrian, if I could just add, I think the app download effort is really just part of our broader priority around perfecting the core and optimizing the core business. We identified that not as many of our guests were using the app as they should. And we know that the app is a much better user experience than the web. So it's, again, part of a broader suite of road map items that are intended to improve and perfect the core experience.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\n\nRichard J. Clarke\n\nJust on -- you mentioned on the prepared remarks and you mentioned that Q4 that Q1 would have quite a tough comp, and there's calendar effects in there as well. But you're guiding the Q2 is going to be flat on room night growth. So is there anything you'd call out in Q2 that's maybe holding that back and how we should think about the rest of the year? And maybe just a similar question on margin. The Q2 guide, I guess a little bit softer than consensus had. Some calendar in there. Is that including any of the growth investments you talk about? Or are those things that may come in more the second half of the year?\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes. Thanks, Richard. Let me just talk a little bit about the trends that we see year-to-date to help answer your question. So first, as you point out, as we're heading into 2024, we were widely aware that last January was particularly strong. And so the guide that we provided back in February included a step down in growth from Q4 to Q1. That was reflective of that hard comp from a year ago. We did experience it. And then since then, we've seen relatively stable growth, which I see as, frankly, a really strong statement in terms of both the stability and resilience of leisure travel demand so far this year. \r\nI think something that we've seen this year that is contrasting to last year is last year, there was a lot of volatility in terms of the timing of when people booked relative to their check-ins. And so far this year, it's been frankly much more stable. Lead times on our platform have been frankly generally in line with a year ago, and there just hasn't been the same level of volatility, again, that we saw a year ago. And so heading into Q2, our guidance reflects this continued stability of bookings. Obviously, we'd like to deliver higher growth than stable growth, but our outlook obviously reflects the trends that we have seen quarter-to-date. \r\nTo your question on Q2 margins, obviously, we guided -- the Q1 results reflect a pretty meaningful year-over-year margin expansion. A big portion of that is due to the timing of Easter. So Easter is not only a benefit to revenue growth in Q1, but it's obviously also a benefit to margin expansion. Those 2 factors reversed in Q2. It is a headwind to revenue growth, and it is a headwind to overall margins. \r\nTwo other components in terms of what's putting pressure on margins in Q2. One is just some onetime credits that we had in payment processing a year ago that will not recur this year. And then third, we shifted slightly the timing of our marketing spend. A little bit heavier in Q2 than in Q1, and that will be reflected in terms of marketing as a percent of revenue growing in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\n\nJed Kelly\n\nJust one on ADRs. They seem to seem to be relatively sticky. And I think a couple of quarters ago, you talked about driving value to the consumer. So can you just give us an update on where you are in sort of some of your value initiatives? And then on supply, grade supply growth again. Can you talk about how we should think about supply and nights eventually converging to similar growth rates?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nJed, why don't I take the first one and -- on value initiatives, and I'll let Ellie take the second one? So on providing value. When we started Airbnb, our original tagline was a cheap, affordable alternative to a hotel. And the majority of -- the primary reason people came to us is because it's a better value than a hotel. And we still think that's a core value proposition that we have to offer. Now 1.5 years ago, we noticed that there was a lot of concern about Airbnb prices increasing. And so we created a whole team to identify a series of initiatives to modulate our prices, and they are working. And I'll go down the list. \r\nOne is total price display. So as you know, in travel, especially online travel, there's a lot of progressive fee disclosures. And we decided to have a toggle right on the home page that you can turn on to show the total price display. Since we've done that, not only do consumers -- not only are consumers going towards the best total value, but it's begun to change behavior in our host community because 300,000 hosts or (inaudible) have removed or lowered their cleaning fee as a result. So that was the first thing we did. \r\nThe next thing we did is we started offering monthly and weekly discounts and much more robust tools for that. Now this is important because nearly half of our nights booked are for stays of a week or longer. And now more than 2/3 of our hosts offer a monthly or weekly discount. We also noticed that a lot of host that weren't getting booked weren't getting booked because their prices were too high, and they just didn't have really good concept. So we created a tool called the compare listing tool where people can see how much other people are charging in the neighborhood. And they can actually see people who are getting booked, not getting booked. And no surprise, people getting booked generally have lower prices. So we have nearly 2 million hosts that now use the compare listing tool. \r\nSo there's just a few of the initiatives we've done. We actually have many others as well. The net of all of it is that hotel prices are up year-over-year and Airbnb listings on a like-for-like basis are down. So today, the value of Airbnb versus hotel is better than it was a year ago, and I think that trend line is going to continue given all of our efforts. And maybe the only other thing I'll just say on this is, as we know, law of supply and demand, as supply grows faster than demand, prices go down a little bit. And supply is growing faster than demand. I think that's also relieving some pressure. Ellie, over to you.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes. So Jed, to your question with regard to the relative growth rates of supply and demand, just a few comments. I would say, first, something that we've shared previously is that in any given quarter, we would not expect supply and demand to grow exactly in line. But when we look over a longer time period, either the last decade or more specifically from pre-pandemic to today, what we do see is that over a period of years, they do grow generally in line. And I would say that continues to be the case. \r\nWhere we are right now, I would say we are very encouraged to be able to deliver this continued level of very strong supply growth for a couple of reasons. I would say, one, we know that more unique differentiated supply wins and differentiated supply is why people come to Airbnb. I would say, second, and Brian made this point, but growing supply allows us to -- it really benefits our affordability measures in that more supply obviously begets more competitive pricing. And then I would say, third, relevant to our recent quality initiatives, we see it as an opportunity for -- as supply growth is stronger than demand growth for us to continue to be driving quality. \r\nWhat you saw in the quarter is we obviously did some onetime takedowns of supply that frankly just did not meet our community's expectations. And the fact that supply is growing so rapidly, it allows us to make those cuts, if you will, to the supply base and to be continually upgrading the level of quality that we deliver to our guests.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nBrian, I wanted to ask you about search on Airbnb just following the strength and the benefits of Guest Favorites. I wanted to better understand sort of -- talk just about post Guest Favorites how search and really conversion rates have improved and really how you feel search can just evolve over time. And then as a follow-up to what we were just talking about around inventory quality, I would love to hear just the process to ensure that quality listings continue to come on the platform. I think we've talked about verified listings and trophies, but any other thoughts there would be helpful.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. These are really, really great questions, Ron. Let's start with search. So we did approximately $10 billion last year in revenue. So the way to think about this is if we can just drive an incremental 100 basis points in growth, that's $100 million. So like the way we look at our conversion rate is like we have teams dedicated to the search experience. And we -- over the last year, we -- the last 12 months, we've likely driven at least a few hundred basis points of incremental growth just through optimization of the search flow because we just get so much traffic. \r\nAnd so just to call out a couple of things that we did. I mean there's been dozens and dozens. I'll just name a couple. One I already mentioned, mobile app downloads. Now why did mobile app downloads lead to also more bookings? Because the conversion rate on a native application is typically a lot higher than on mobile website. \r\nNumber two, just to give you a couple of examples. One of the challenges at Airbnb compared to hotel is you may type in a location and certain dates and maybe you're on vacation and you don't see exactly the home you need and you might not book a home. You might now open a different app. And we have this carousel that basically offers, hey, if you change your dates by 1 or 2 days, here are other listings you can find, and that led to a huge increase in bookings. \r\nWe made improvements to filters. We've made improvements to search input to search box, making the search box more prominent. So there are quite literally dozens and dozens of improvements that we've made. And I see hundreds of basis points of incremental growth just through essentially optimizing the end-to-end guest flow for our core business. So it's really, really exciting. And a couple of big areas would be maps in location. There's a huge opportunity around that area. So that's on search. \r\nOn inventory and quality, this is a great question. I mean we have a really extensive road map. Last year, we launched Guest Favorites, as you know. In November, the 100 million nights book have been booked through them. I would say the response to Guest Favorites has even been greater than I anticipated. We're seeing more people not only book Guest Favorites, but we're seeing that Guest Favorites have a fraction of the trip issue and contact rate as non-Guest Favorites. So Guest Favorites have between 1/5 and 1/10 the contact rate as our bottom quartile listing, and the rebooking rates are much higher. And I also think what guest favorites are doing is it's changing behavior to encourage more hosts to become better. \r\nAnd so after that, we launched quality highlights in March. Quality highlights, basically what happened was Guest Favorites are the top 2 million listings in Airbnb. But a bunch of people are saying, well, how do we know which are the best within those 2 million? So what we did is we have a top 1%, top 5% and top 10% trophy classification. And this is also really, I think, popular with guests. We've now removed hundreds of thousands of listings, and we are going to be doing a number of new things. \r\nOne of the things we're experimenting with is showing the percentile, where something falls in a quality distribution as a percentile basis and then continually adding a lot more supply and then tightening up our quality control and really giving a lot more feedback to hosts to become better. I think that's a really good opportunity here to get a lot more listings in Guest Favorites and to provide hosts education host tools for the hosts that are struggling to be much more successful. So there's a pretty big and extensive road map to go. \r\nAnd just the last thing I'll say about this is as big as Airbnb is, and we're approaching 0.5 billion room nights a year, for everyone who stays in Airbnb, somewhere around 8 or 9 people stay in hotels. And when you ask people, why are you staying in a hotel? Airbnb is typically more affordable. It's a more local experience. It's much better for groups and families. People say, yes, but hotels are historically a more consistent experience. And so if we can just get one of those travelers from hotels to stay in Airbnb, that would double our size of our business to 1 billion nights a year. And so we think quality and reliability is a multiyear road map. So you're going to be hearing every year major updates from us on quality and reliability.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\n\nMaybe coming back and putting a finer point on some of the topics we've talked about already, Brian. When you think about your top investment priorities for 2024 and beyond, how would you categorize those investments if we put them in buckets demand generation, supply growth and platform and product innovation over the long term? And in that last bucket, how should we increasingly think about what you're learning about testing and deploying AI across the platform and how it might reduce friction over the longer term?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nEric, good to hear from you. So maybe I can just -- you have 3 buckets. Maybe I can give you 3 slightly different buckets to give you our framework. The way I think about deploying our resources -- and when I say resources, probably the most precious resource we have is product and engineering resources. And the way I think about that is we have our core business, we have international expansion, and we have expanding beyond our core business of accommodation. So that's kind of the way we think about our portfolio. And you can imagine, they're all totally different horizons. \r\nSo the majority of our people are still focused on the core business, and I believe that we are just scratching the surface of the size of our core business. Within our core business, we typically have about 3 different areas of focus. One I just talked about, which is quality and reliability. The other -- the next one is affordability, making sure Airbnbs are more affordable than hotels. And the third is usability, what I also talked about with search and reducing friction. \r\nSo that's the first bucket of our investment. And that really will pay off within this year. And so there's -- you can get a return on those efforts within a matter of months because a lot of that -- a lot of those changes are software changes. They're immediate. They touch 100% of our user base. and they touch a very large base or entire GBV.\r\nNext is international expansion. International expansion is really supply, demand and platform. It's all 3 within international. And you could really bucket into 2 things. We have to localize the product, and then we have to have a global marketing strategy to like go one market at a time. And we've done a lot of really good work over the last 2 years on international expansion. But I think at this moment, we are ready to step on the gas. And by stepping on the gas, I don't mean it's going to be a significantly greater investment but a much greater velocity because we spend a lot of energy updating our products. \r\nSo most recently, we just updated our application in Asia, specifically in China, and we're bringing a lot of those improvements to Japan and Korea because the applications work fairly similarly. And so getting these products onto a better standard is a really good first thing that you want to do before you actually step on the gas from marketing. That's international. \r\nAnd of course, the final thing is expanding in our core business of accommodation. So from dollars and number of people, this is by far the smallest area that we're putting people on now because it's a small base, but it's actually where I'm spending the majority of my time. And I think the majority of the leadership's time is now being spent focused on transforming the company from an accommodations business to a multi-vertical or multi-category company. And over the next 3 years, you're going to see this play out quite substantially. So that's the way we think about it, core, international and then expanding beyond our core. \r\nAnd I think the other question -- sorry, I have to answer your question about how are you -- what are we learning about AI and reducing friction. So just a couple of things on AI. First of all, like we've been using AI for a long time. In the last 12 months, we've made a lot of progress. I'll just give you 3 examples of things we've done with AI. We made it easier to host. We have a computer vision model that we trained with 100 million photos, and that allows hosts to -- like the AI model to organize all their photos by room. Why would you want to do this? Because this increases conversion rate when you do this. \r\nNumber two, we launched last week AI-powered quick replies for hosts. So basically, predicts the right kind of question or answer for a host to pre-generate to provide to guests. And this has been really helpful. And then we've made a really big impact on reducing partners in Airbnb with a reservation screening technology. So now we're going much bigger on generative AI. I think I think we're going to see the biggest impact is going to be on customer service in the near term. \r\nI think more than hotels, probably even more than OTA, Airbnb will benefit from generative AI. And the reason why, it's just a simple structural reason. We have the most like buried inventory. We don't have any SKUs, and we're an incredibly global platform. So it's a very difficult customer service challenge. But imagine an AI agent that can actually like read a corpus of 1,000 pages of policies and be able to help adjudicate and help a customer service agent help a guest from Germany staying with a host in Japan. It's a very difficult problem that AI can really supplement. Over time, we're going to bring the AI capabilities from customer service to search and to the broader experience. And the end game is to provide basically an AI-powered concierge. So that's where it's going, but it's really focused on customer service at this very moment.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\n\nI have 2 just to sort of come back to a couple of the topics we talked about. The comp did get easier. So with the comps getting modestly harder in the back half, can you just sort of walk us through maybe micro levels of innovation that can sort of drive stability? Or how do we think about reasonable ranges of outcomes for room night growth in the second half? And then the second one, Brian, you talked about how like-for-like pricing is more attractive versus hotels. I don't know have the transcript exactly yet. But if I look at Marriott and Hilton and their ADRs are up 2% to 3% and your ADRs are also up 2% to 3%, is there something else that you're seeing where the relative pricing is actually becoming more attractive that you can help us understand a little bit more?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. Why don't I take the second question? And I think, Brian, either you or I cut out, so we didn't hear the first part of your question. So you want to just repeat the first question?\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\n\nYes. Yes, absolutely, yes. The first question was more for Ellie where she has -- you talked about how you have stable room night growth now, but I think the comp is a little bit easier from 1Q to 2Q. And with the comps getting a little more difficult in the back half, can you just sort of walk us through some reasonable range of outcomes of growth in the back half and maybe macro-level drivers to kind of keep the stability versus drive deceleration?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nEllie, you want to take the first one, and I'll take the second one?\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes. So I think you're right in terms of the thinking was that the comparison in Q2 would be a little bit softer. I think what we've seen so far, just to repeat what I said previously, is that yes, it was clear there was a hard comp in January. Since then, we've seen, I would just say, a general stability. We are not so far this year seeing the same level of volatility that we saw in '23 in terms of either movement of lead times or consumer, I would say, hesitancy to book during kind of macro dislocation. So general statement is that year-to-date, just the trends have been stable, and that's what our Q2 reflects. \r\nIn terms of the back half of the year, I would say I don't know if I would characterize the back half of the year as harder comps. I think if you recall, actually, some of the volatility that we and others saw in the back half of the year, there was a bit of a moment of dislocation end of summer heading into October and in particular in the month of October related to the conflict breaking out in Israel. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize the back half of the year as being a harder comp. \r\nInstead, I think if you think through the growth initiatives that Brian talked about in terms of thinking about where our portfolio of investments lie, I would say we are optimistic that a lot of the core optimization would have near-term impact as well as the international investments. So those are the places where we're really looking to drive in-year growth above where we are today.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAnd Brian, I'll take the like-for-like question. So specifically, the data we're citing is global like-for-like basis. So what we're comparing is the average price of the global hotel room to a one-bedroom listing on Airbnb in March. And in March, our prices were down 2% and hotel prices were up 3%. So our prices were -- again, one bedroom globally on Airbnb and March was $114, down 2%. Hotels were $148, up 3%. So that's what we're talking about, one bedroom global. \r\nWhen our ADRs move, obviously, the other thing to take into consideration is mix shift. Oftentimes, our ADRs do go up because people -- increasingly, more and more of our travel is group travel. 81% of our trips now have 2 or more guests. And increasingly. we're seeing people booking more space, larger homes just as travel is mixing towards larger groups.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nThat was particularly the case in North America this quarter. On an absolute basis, ADRs were up. But if you exclude the impact of mix, they were flat.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of James Lee with Mizuho.\n\nJames Lee\n\nGreat. I just want to follow up the prior question on supply and demand growth. And in other segments of the gig economy services, they seem to benefit when supply exceeding demand. So if you think about ridesharing and food delivery because they drive prices down and therefore increasing consumer demand, should we think about it in the same path for home accommodation? Are you thinking -- expecting maybe a similar trend for your business as well?\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nI would say, generally speaking, when we see growth in supply, it is additive to demand. It means that when people are searching for a particular night in a particular city, if we have more that we can provide them, it is obviously net beneficial. I think I would just repeat the prior comments that we don't always see kind of in-period equivalents by market in terms of the respective growth rates and that I would say there's a primary difference in terms of our business model relative to some of the others that you mentioned in that the frequency of the activity is simply lower and the lead time is also much longer.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS.\n\nStephen D. Ju\n\nOkay. So Brian, will we be overreaching if we would think that Icons is a leading indicator of what should be, I guess, a revitalization or reimagining of experiences? So maybe the overnight stay (inaudible) generates all the media and consumer attention, but maybe this affords you the opportunity to expose the users you're getting to the more everyday experiences. And also secondarily, you've talked about this (inaudible) talked about this also, the Olympics and the Euro Cup and there's going to be travelers who are probably not sports fans who might want to be avoiding Paris in the host cities in Germany altogether. So is there anything you can share in terms of how additive these 2 events may be?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAll right, Stephen. Well, that was -- you were absolutely not overreaching on Icons. So let me give you a sense. You can think of a company that's going through a few phases, especially to start a company. You have an idea. You get product market fit. That's Phase 1. Phase 2 is you try to go to hyper growth. We've done that. Phase 3, you become a real company. You go public. You generate a return for shareholders. And then the fourth frontier, and very few companies have ever done this, is you reinvent yourself and you go from offering one thing to many things. And a lot of the big tech companies have done this. \r\nBut one of the companies that I think is a really interesting one to look at is Nike. In the late '70s and early '80s -- it's my recollection. I was born in '81. But this is my reflection, is I remember Nike was mostly a running shoe company. And in the '80s, they became more popular with basketball and other things. But at the time, people didn't really think of Nike as a serious basketball shoe. And so they had to not only create a great product for basketball, but they have to actually stretch the brand and open up in people's minds what Nike stands for. And a lot of brands have had to do this. I mean Apple had to do this with the iPod.\r\nAnd I think Airbnb, one of the strengths of our brand also is something that we have to manage, which is Airbnb is a noun and a verb. It's synonymous with the category, kind of like Kleenex or Xerox. People say, I'm going to get an Airbnb. I'm going to Airbnb my place. Literally the name Airbnb has the name B and B in it. So one of the challenges is that people open our app to expect to see stays. And so what we want to do in addition to bringing back experiences, you are totally right, is we wanted to expand Airbnb's brand positioning to include more than just a place to stay. \r\nAnd one of the things you'll notice is when we launched Icons, we said these are extraordinary experiences. We didn't say these are extraordinary stays. We positioned them as experiences. And so you can almost imagine Icons is like we're a car company where we're starting with a Formula 1 car. And very few people can experience the Formula 1 car, but it captures the magic. It captures the demand. It really expands the brand and increases our permission to be able to go into experiences. And then you kind of move down market. And one of our goals is going to be to bring the magic of Icons to everyone. \r\nSo I can't probably say too much more about experiences. But absolutely, it's not a lever stretch whatsoever. Icons is primarily a brand positioning and a brand investment. It obviously was in the business. It's only about 4,000 tickets. But we're seeing some really encouraging signs in the last week, a big bump in traffic. It's a lot more top of mind. A lot more people are opening our app. And I just think we're being positioned as more aspirational, and I think people are now starting to think about us for experiences. So I think we've really laid -- paved the way for next year. Ellie, do you want to take the Olympics and Euro Cup?\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes. Yes, certainly. So if you look at our history, I would say that special events have always been kind of a good moment for Airbnb to shine and have been overall additive in terms of both our brand perception as well as supply growth. I think what we've seen from prior events, and I'm talking about pre-COVID Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl, those type of events, what we see is that it should bring a ton of supply onto the platform. And while not all of that supply will persist, a good portion of it does. And so it's a nice supply acquisition moment for us. \r\nI would also say it's really additive in terms of signaling to cities how helpful and additive Airbnb can be to those cities to ramp up supply in a very organic and easy way without adding incremental hotel infrastructure that will not be necessarily needed long term. And I think you see that in particular in Paris right now. We're going to be hugely additive in terms of hosting travelers for the games, whereas the existing infrastructure would not be able to manage such a large inflow.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDae K. Lee\n\nThis is Dae on for Doug. One for you, Ellie. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the investment levers that provide flexibility to shape your 35% plus EBITDA margin guide for the full year? And can we expect to see these levers get pulled more through the year?\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes. So I couldn't hear entirely, but a question about our guide for full year EBITDA margins of floor 35%. Let me just talk a little bit -- yes, the investment levers.\n\nDae K. Lee\n\nHow you're thinking about investment numbers, yes.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes, of course. So let me just step back and provide a little bit more color in terms of why the 35%. If you look at our performance since the IPO, pre-IPO, we had a negative 5% EBITDA margin. And lo and behold, 3 years after the IPO, we delivered nearly 37% EBITDA margins last year. I think we have repeatedly demonstrated the increased strength of this business model in terms of very strong profitability, inclusive of GAAP net income profitability as well as free cash flow. And at the same time, where we sit today, we see a huge opportunity in driving incremental growth. \r\nAnd so as we kicked off the year last quarter and looked at our opportunity set, we've identified a handful of areas where we'd like the flexibility to lean in and drive incremental growth beyond what we're seeing today. So where would you see those investment levers on the P&L? It's really 2 areas. So first, not surprisingly, is marketing. In marketing, we've been very disciplined over the last couple of years. We continue to have a much lower level of marketing intensity than really anyone else in travel. \r\nAnd at the same time, at the margin, we have seen some incremental opportunities to lean in on channels where we're seeing high ROIs. In Q1, we saw nice very high ROIs in performance marketing. To the extent that, that continues, we would lean in modestly over the course of the year. Additionally and probably more importantly, Brian talked a little bit about our opportunity set in international markets. And that's also an area where, to the extent that our full funnel marketing investments are working, we would look to top off those investments and to therefore accelerate growth. So marketing is one line item you will potentially see some margin compression in order to drive growth. \r\nThe second area, Brian talked about prioritizing our resources and identified that in many cases, our product development team is our kind of scarcest resource. And I think when you hear us talk about our road map, you can obviously infer that we have a very robust list of initiatives that we would like to tackle. And so there's an opportunity to, at the margin, add more personnel over the course of the year to allow us to accelerate that road map. And you would see that on -- in particular on the product development line item. So grand scheme of things, no material pivot in terms of our overall financial discipline, but instead a bit of lean into those areas where we believe we can accelerate growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen.\n\nKevin Campbell Kopelman\n\nI had a question on the May release. You added a couple of small new features to the user profile, I think, on the photos and the travel stamps. Do we see that as a first step towards some of the profile enhancements and community features that you've talked about being interested in, in the past? And where does this kind of building out potentially new community features stand in your priority list?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. Kevin, we spoke in this call mostly about Icons, but I mean I am equally excited for the results that we've seen for group travel. I'm not going to go through all the metrics, but the metrics have been all really, really positive for your travel features. And in particular, one of the things we've seen is -- when people book an Airbnb, the average number of guests is 2. So that means that typically for every booking, there's another guest. But typically, the other guest doesn't -- hasn't connected their account to Airbnb. \r\nSo if you travel with a partner or a friend, maybe if you book, the other person doesn't actually have an account or they haven't connected their account. So as we've -- and it's strategic for us to get more accounts that would make sense, right, especially as we want to sell more things beyond home. We want to have a point of sale for every single person on a trip, not just a point of sale for the booker. So this is really, really critical for us. And what we've seen is a major jump in the number of co-travelers that are now creating account in Airbnb and not only creating accounts but filling out their profile. \r\nAnd so to answer your question, yes, this is the beginning of something much bigger. To probably zoom out, when we started Airbnb, there already were vacation rentals, but they were mostly on classified sites like craigslist or they were like paid subscription services like Vrbo. And one of the innovations we brought is we added profiles, payments, 2-sided reviews, and messaging. And those capabilities unlocked really this whole new category. This is what we may call the system of trust. \r\nSo what we're now doing is we're going to be investing a lot more in increasing our profile and our profile capabilities, both our account structure, cleaning it up, our identity verification, making -- getting more people to complete more robust profiles, increasing their preferences. So we have more information about people. And this is so strategic because as trust goes up, you can unlock more things for people. And as we know more about you, we can match you better. \r\nSo I think in the future -- right now, if you think of like the Airbnb solar system, the home is like the sun at the center of the solar system. I think in the future, the profile will be at the center of the solar system of Airbnb, and the home will be one of many categories orbiting the profile.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Nick Jones with Citizens JMP.\n\nNicholas Freeman Jones\n\nI guess maybe going back to supply and your effort to remove low-quality supply. I guess can you speak to the percentage of the supply that you've removed over time? I think you said hundreds of thousands that, I guess, maybe take the removal and I guess learnings and come back and try to list and provide kind of a higher quality or better experience. I guess as you continue to remove lower-quality supplies, it's becoming a tool to kind of nudge hosts into the behavior you're looking for without actually having to remove them.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. I mean -- why don't I take the first one? So the first thing I'll say is the global occupancy on Airbnb is so much lower than hotels. So even though you type in a certain date in a location, when there's a popular date in a location, occupancy can rise at a global level. We are still like not even close to high occupancy. And so one of the games that we need to do is we want to point demand to the best supply on Airbnb. So we don't -- and so having removed all the supply, we haven't seen a fundamental shift or impact on global bookings because a lot of them either weren't getting as many bookings in the first place or they were eating up page views. They were lower converting listings or people were booking them. They were really expensive because they were leaning to customer service contracts, which are expensive. And if you went through all that, the rebooking rate for them was much lower. \r\nNow as far as the answer to your question about like how many of them come back, I don't have the stats on the top of my head. But I think that like this quality control program, one of the things we've noticed is that a lot of hosts are very coachable and learnable. They're very coachable and they can learn. So I think one of the problems in this category is, historically, these marketplaces have been so hands off that people don't know what it takes to be successful. And as you give them more like metrics, as you give them more incentives to be good and as you create more boundaries about what's not acceptable in Airbnb, it actually does change behavior. And people do come back. So we're seeing that for sure, and we're seeing that the good people rewarded, and they to expand their business. \r\nSo I don't have the exact numbers of people that have come back, but absolutely, we do think people will come back if they remediated some of their issues. And some of them, what we do, too, is we'll give warnings to people. So we don't always have to remove people. We can give warnings first. And warnings are like very, very effective. We're just giving them a heads up, and that actually has a way of increasing the quality of our platform. \r\nThe last thing I'll just say on this is we've -- what I think makes Airbnb different than our competitors, we have a much more hands-on approach to quality than our competitors. But we are getting more and more hands on every single year. As we want to get bigger and we want to capture more of the hotel shopping market, our quality and capacity has to go up, and that means that we need to just continue to raise the bar of quality. So we have a multiyear road map where we're going to continue to do so and continue to invest in host education.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Naved Khan with B. Riley Securities.\n\nNaved Ahmad Khan\n\nMaybe a clarification from Ellie. I think I heard you say you saw really good ROIs on the performance marketing channels. Just wanted to understand where that came from. And maybe on a related topic, was there any effect from either roll-out of the DMA in Europe in March or maybe changes to Google Search in late March and early April? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes. So in terms of, first, the high ROI that we're seeing on marketing, I would say, we, over the last year, have just been, frankly, very encouraged with the ROAs that we've been able to deliver from that channel. In particular, like what has been driving that? Well, we've been continually testing and improving our performance marketing execution. We have expanded the target audiences. We've expanded our keyword coverage. We've made general improvements to the landing pages and all of that has been, I would say, quite successful in terms of allowing us to spend marginally more and maintain really great efficiencies. So a really good channel for us even though it is obviously a minority of our overall marketing spend or strategy.\r\nIn terms of your second question, impact from the DMA rollout, I would say, we haven't seen any meaningful impact. I think primarily, that is because the majority, 90% of our traffic is coming to us through direct or unpaid traffic. And so it is just -- we have not seen any noticeable impact there yet or at all, I should say.\n\nNaved Ahmad Khan\n\nAnd then -- yes, no, it does help. So maybe just on the changes to the extenuating circumstances policy, wanted to kind of understand whether what kind of led to that change and what kind of impact we can expect from the outside looking in.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nI didn't hear that question. Sorry.\n\nNaved Ahmad Khan\n\nSorry. The changes to the extenuating circumstances policy. I think it was tweaked recently to kind of maybe raise the bar on cancellations.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nExtenuating circumstance policy, Brian, do you have any comments on that? I would say we just tried to clarify over time and make that more equitable for our guests and hosts, but no meaningful impact to the business.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes, I agree.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\n\nConor T. Cunningham\n\nJust on the underpenetrated international markets, as you develop those, I'm just curious if they're producing the -- what you'd expect in terms of key KPIs from take rate, ADR, profits? Just trying to understand how the mix changes are going to impact the overall company. And then just one on the 2Q to 3Q reacceleration. I would assume that the booking window is a little bit more extended this year given some of the events. Just curious on where you're booked into 3Q right now. Just trying to understand the confidence interval there.\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nYes, sure. So first, the question is around economics of our international expansion markets. So if you think about the various factors on our economics, so first, there's virtually no change in terms of our underlying take rates by market. So that is not a factor. I would say, second, depending on the market that we're targeting, many of these markets will have lower ADRs than our averages. \r\nSo over time, to the extent that we were incrementally more successful and higher -- seeing higher penetration in places like Latin America or Asia Pacific, we would anticipate that the global ADR would come down, and yet all of those nights would be accretive. So it would be market expanding, even if the nights were coming in at a lower ADR. And what we've been able to achieve over time is very strong economics at the booking level for a wide range of ADRs. So it is not a concern for us to be expanding in markets where the average ADRs are lower. It is, again, just accretive in terms of the top line and the volume of the business.\r\nYour second question is around lead times. I would say, generally speaking, as I said previously, our lead times year-to-date have been pretty flat on a year-over-year basis. We did not see a pull forward that maybe some others in the industry mentioned. And yet, when we look forward in terms of the backlog for Q3, it's quite strong. And it's that backlog that gives us confidence around the comments we made in the outlook that Q3 revenue should accelerate above the Q2 outlook.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAll right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. And I just want to say before I wrap up, this was Ellie's first earnings call as CFO, and the transition has gone incredibly well. Her, Dave and I are really, really focused on this next chapter of growth. \r\nSo to recap, revenue was $2.1 billion. This is 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q1 records, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $4.2 billion, representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. Now we've made a tremendous amount of progress over the past few years, and with the launch of Icons, we're now laying the foundation for our plans to expand beyond our core business. This is just the beginning. Thank you all, and we'll see you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our call for today. We thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, stretched its winning streak to a sixth straight session and closed above 39,000 points for the first time in five weeks.\n\nMoney market traders are pricing in U.S. rate cuts of 43 basis points (bps) by the end of 2024, according to LSEG's rate probabilities app. Before the jobs data, they were pricing in just one rate cut due to signs of a resilient economy and sticky inflation.\n\nMarket focus will shift to weekly jobless claims data and remarks from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly during the day.\n\nBoston Fed President Susan Collins on Wednesday expressed confidence that the current setting of monetary policy will slow the economy in a way she believes will be necessary to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, edged up for a second day after the auction of 10-year notes.\n\nThat in turn piled pressure on megacap stocks such as Apple and Microsoft in premarket trading.\n\nBy 5:19 a.m. ET, S&P 500 e-minis dipped 17.5 points, or 0.34%. Nasdaq 100 e-minis slipped 79.75 points, or 0.44%, and Dow e-minis dropped 105 points, or 0.27%.\n\nArm Holdings tumbled 8.7% after the chip designer forecast full-year revenue below expectations even as March-quarter results beat estimates.\n\nRival Nvidia slipped 0.7%.\n\nTesla dipped 1.1% after Bloomberg News reported the electric vehicle maker's job cuts were escalating in China.\n\nRobinhood Markets gained 5.4% after the online brokerage beat estimates for first-quarter profit, thanks to robust crypto trading volumes and rate hikes that boosted its net interest revenue.\n\nAirbnb slid nearly 8% after the vacation rental company forecast second-quarter revenue below market expectations.

        "content": "Wednesday, May 8th, 2024\r\n\r\nMarkets were flat again this Hump Day. Over the past week or so of trading, the major indices have been treading water. For the past month, the Dow and the Nasdaq are marginally in the green, while the S&P 500 is marginally in the red and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -0.9%. For today\u2019s session, the Dow scraped together +172 points, +0.44%, while the S&P was exactly 0.00%. The Nasdaq dipped a tad, -0.18%, while the Russell dropped -0.46%. For the Dow, it\u2019s currently on the most tepid six-day winning streak ever.\r\n\r\nWholesale Inventories for March dropped to -0.4%, the lowest level since -0.5% in June of last year, and swinging to a negative month over month from the downwardly revised +0.2% for February. Lower inventory reads aren\u2019t dire economic prints; in fact, they represent some of the worst growth an economy can have (once inventories are built up, if they do not sell right away, they must be rolled off over time). We\u2019ve only had two positive Wholesale reads in the past year, averaging -2.6% over the past 12 months.\r\n\r\nAfter today\u2019s close, Arm Holdings ARM reported fiscal Q4 earnings results. The recently re-publicly traded semiconductor design producer outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 36 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by 6 cents, while top-line sales of $928 million easily surpassed the $885 million analysts were looking for. Next-quarter guidance has been rasied to 32-36 cents per share from 31 cents previously, while full-year revenues of between $875-925 million has a higher median than the $882.5 million estimate. Yet shares are selling off -6% in late trading; that\u2019s something that can happen when you\u2019re +54% year to date: \u201csell the news.\u201d\r\n\r\nAirbnb ABNB shares are also selling off following its quarterly results. Earnings of 43 cents per share on $2.14 billion in revenues shone past the 23 cents per share and $2.07 billion analysts were looking for. But revenues estimates for the current quarter came in $2.68-2.74 billion, below the previous target of $2.76 billion in the Zacks consensus. It marks the twelfth-straight earnings outperformance for the home-stay experiences provider, but shares are still sliding -8% in late trading.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Desk TTD also beat on top and bottom lines this afternoon. The demand-side automation platform beat estimates by four cents to 26 cents per share (and above the 23 cents per share posted a year ago), while sales of $491 million amounts to a +28% positive surprise from $480 million expected. Revenues for the current quarter are anticipated to come in at $575 million or more, easily beating expectations for $570 million. Shares are up nearly +2% in the late session, adding to its +21% growth year to date.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Earnings per share in the quarter jumped to 41 cents; analysts surveyed by FactSet expected 23 cents.\n\nEarnings growth was partly driven by a shift in the Easter holiday, which fell during the second quarter in 2023 versus the first quarter this year.\n\nAirbnb projected revenue in the second quarter between $2.68 billion and $2.74 billion. That fell short of Wall Street expectations, partly because of unfavorable exchange rates and partly because of the shift in the Easter holiday.\n\nView comments",

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +78.26%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $0.23.\n\nWhile investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.\n\nSince these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.\n\nHere is how Airbnb performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGross Booking Value: $22.90 billion versus the seven-analyst average estimate of $22.50 billion.

        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 78.26%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of 13.43%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAirbnb , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Content industry, posted revenues of $2.14 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.66%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAirbnb shares have added about 17.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for Airbnb?\n\nWhile Airbnb has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Airbnb: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.93 on $2.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.35 on $11.14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Content is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Yelp (YELP), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 9.\n\nThis online business reviews company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +100%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nYelp's revenues are expected to be $333.66 million, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Airbnb's (NASDAQ:ABNB) Q1: Beats On Revenue But Stock Drops\n\nOnline accommodations platform Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) announced better-than-expected results in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 17.8% year on year to $2.14 billion. On the other hand, next quarter's revenue guidance of $2.71 billion was less impressive, coming in 1.1% below analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $0.41 per share, improving from its profit of $0.17 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Airbnb? Find out in our full research report.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.14 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.06 billion (3.9% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $424 million vs analyst estimates of $326 million (large beat) EPS: $0.41 vs analyst estimates of $0.23 ($0.18 beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $2.71 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $2.74 billion\u00a0(guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2 2024 to be down year on year compared to Q2 of 2023) Gross Margin (GAAP): 77.6%, up from 76.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $1.9 billion, up from $46 million in the previous quarter Nights and Experiences Booked: 132.6 million, up 11.5 million year on year Market Capitalization: $101.5 billion\n\nFounded by Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky by renting out a blowup bed on the floor of their San Francisco apartment, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is the world\u2019s largest online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays.\n\nOnline Travel\n\nBecause of the enormous number of flights, hotels, and accommodations available, travel is a natural fit for marketplaces that aggregate suppliers, simplifying the shopping process for consumers. Online travel platforms today make up over 50% of the industry\u2019s bookings, a percentage that has been rising for 20 years, and will likely continue in the years ahead.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAirbnb's revenue growth over the last three years has been exceptional, averaging 59.6% annually. This quarter, Airbnb beat analysts' estimates and reported 17.8% year-on-year revenue growth. Airbnb Total Revenue\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Airbnb is expecting revenue to grow 9.1% year on year to $2.71 billion, slowing from the 18.1% year-on-year increase it recorded in the comparable quarter last year. Ahead of the earnings results, analysts were projecting sales to grow 10.8% over the next 12 months.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsage Growth\n\nAs an online travel company, Airbnb generates revenue growth by increasing both the number of stays (or experiences) booked and the commission charged on those bookings.\n\nOver the last two years, Airbnb's nights booked, a key performance metric for the company, grew 16.8% annually to 132.6 million. This is solid growth for a consumer internet company. Airbnb Nights and Experiences Booked\n\nIn Q1, Airbnb added 11.5 million nights booked, translating into 9.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nRevenue Per Booking\n\nAverage revenue per booking (ARPB) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Airbnb because it not only measures how much users book on its platform but also the commission that Airbnb can charge. Airbnb ARPB\n\nAirbnb's ARPB growth has been decent over the last two years, averaging 7%. The company's ability to increase prices while growing its nights booked demonstrates the value of its platform. This quarter, ARPB grew 7.6% year on year to $16.15 per booking.\n\nKey Takeaways from Airbnb's Q1 Results\n\nIt was great to see Airbnb beat analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad it expanded its number of bookings. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and its revenue growth slowed. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Airbnb. The company is down 7.2% on the results and currently trades at $146.25 per share.\n\nAirbnb may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Vacation rental company Airbnb reported a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, boosted by an increase in travel in international markets as North American bookings decelerated during the period.\n\nShares of the company were up 3% after the bell.\n\nAccommodation companies in the first quarter have seen the demand for travel in regions outside of North America boost earnings as travel accelerates in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The company said it expects to see steady growth throughout 2024, spurred by travel demand centered around international events.\n\nActive listings on the platform grew 17% year-over-year with Asia and Latin America leading the additions.\n\nNights and experiences booked in the first quarter increased 9.5% year-over-year to about $133 million driven by a 21% and 19% growth in bookings in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, respectively. The company said bookings in North America \"slightly decelerated\" during the quarter.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company reported net income of $264 million, or 41 cents per share, for the quarter ended March, compared with $117 million, or 18 cents per share, during the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal first quarter revenue rose 18% year-over-year to $2.14 billion.\n\nThe average cost per night in an Airbnb or average daily rate was $173 in the reported quarter, a 3% rise compared to the year prior. The company saw an increase in shorter stays and bookings of entire homes which drove higher margins.\n\nIt forecast second-quarter revenue between $2.68 billion and $2.74 billion, below analysts' estimates of $2.74 billion, due in part to currency exchange rates and the timing of Easter which was beneficial to the first quarter, but may weigh on earnings in the second quarter, the company said.\n\nLooking ahead to the summer, Airbnb said it expects year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate in the third-quarter due in part to travel demand centered around the Olympics and Euro Cup.\n\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Jain in Bengaluru and Doyinsola Oladipo in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\n\nView comments",

The company said it expects to see steady growth throughout 2024, spurred by travel demand centered around international events.\n\nActive listings on the platform grew 17% year-over-year with Asia and Latin America leading the additions.\n\nNights and experiences booked in the first quarter increased 9.5% year-over-year to about $133 million driven by a 21% and 19% growth in bookings in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, respectively. The company said bookings in North America \"slightly decelerated\" during the quarter.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company reported net income of $264 million, or 41 cents per share, for the quarter ended March, compared with $117 million, or 18 cents per share, during the same period in 2023.\n\nTotal first quarter revenue rose 18% year-over-year to $2.14 billion.\n\nThe average cost per night in an Airbnb or average daily rate was $173 in the reported quarter, a 3% rise compared to the year prior. The company saw an increase in shorter stays and bookings of entire homes which drove higher margins.\n\nIt forecast second-quarter revenue between $2.68 billion and $2.74 billion, below analysts' estimates of $2.74 billion, due in part to currency exchange rates and the timing of Easter which was beneficial to the first quarter, but may weigh on earnings in the second quarter, the company said.\n\nLooking ahead to the summer, Airbnb said it expects year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate in the third-quarter due in part to travel demand centered around the Olympics and Euro Cup.

        "content": "Stocks Falter As Fed Signals Need For Higher-For-Longer Rates; Uber Crashes, Energy Sector Loses Ground: What's Driving Wednesday's Market?\n\nWednesday witnessed a tempering of the bullish sentiment that had buoyed Wall Street in recent sessions, with major indices showing slight declines around midday trading in New York.\n\nHawkish remarks from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Boston Fed President Susan Collins sparked concerns among investors about the potential delay in rate cuts, as the likelihood of enduring higher interest rates gained traction.\n\nKashkari asserted that the Fed would likely need to maintain borrowing costs at current levels for an extended period, potentially throughout the year, and did not rule out rate hikes if inflation remained stubbornly high at 3%.\n\nCollins echoed similar sentiments, suggesting that a slowdown in economic growth would be necessary to bring inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, cautioning against premature rate cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), edged down by 0.2%, striving for a fifth consecutive day of gains, which would mark the longest winning streak since late January.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 also slipped by 0.2%, while blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average marginally managed to avoid losses. However, small-cap stocks were the laggards of the day, with the Russell 2000 Index declining by 0.9%.\n\nIn the commodities market, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s report of a decline in crude oil inventories last week led to a modest 0.6% increase in West Texas Intermediate prices. Gold prices remained steady, while silver experienced a modest uptick of 0.6%.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded flat at $62,300.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance Of Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price Chg % Dow Jones 38,938.23 +53.97 0.1% Nasdaq 100 18,062.51 -28.94 -0.2% S&P 500 5,177.51 -10.19 -0.2% Russell 2000 2,056.16 -1.81 -0.9%\n\nUpdated at 12:54 EDT\n\nWednesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nUber Technologies Inc.

What does an investor watch now?\n\nThere are hundreds of companies reporting this week including some big consumer names and prominent technology companies. We\u2019re going to learn a lot about the state of the consumer this week.\n\nThese 5 stocks are off their 2022 or 2023 lows and all but one has rallied over the last year. Will an earnings beat prove to be a catalyst for any of these companies?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to beat every quarter, or nearly every quarter, each year. Only one of these 5 companies has a significant ongoing earnings surprise streak.\n\n5 Critical Earnings Charts for This Week\n\n1. Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB)\n\nAirbnb has beat 11 quarters in a row. That\u2019s impressive. The company went IPO in 2020, during the pandemic.\n\nShares of Airbnb are up 35% in the last year. It\u2019s not cheap. Airbnb has a forward P/E of 35.8.\n\nWill Airbnb beat again?\n\n2. Shopify Inc. (SHOP)\n\nShopify has beat 5 quarters in a row. That\u2019s a nice earnings surprise streak. Shares of Shopify have risen 25% in the last year but are still a far cry from the 2021 highs.\n\nShopify isn\u2019t cheap, however. It trades with a forward P/E of 77.5.\n\nIs Shopify \u201cback\u201d as one of the must-own technology stocks?\n\n3. Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG)\n\nConstellation Energy is coming off an earnings miss last quarter. The Street didn\u2019t care, though, as the shares have rallied to new all-time highs. Constellation Energy is up 149% over the last year.\n\nConstellation Energy is still attractively priced with a forward P/E of only 26. It\u2019s the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the United States.\n\nWhat will keep Constellation Energy\u2019s rally going?\n\n4. Planet Fitness, Inc. (PLNT)\n\nPlanet Fitness has beat on earnings 3 quarters in a row. Even though shares of Planet Fitness rallied during the pandemic, they have tumbled 12.8% in the last year.\n\nPlanet Fitness isn\u2019t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 24.\n\nHave fitness clubs like Planet Fitness truly recovered from the pandemic downturn?\n\n5. Sweetgreen, Inc. (SG)\n\nSweetgreen, the healthy-food restaurant chain, has missed on earnings 3 quarters in a row.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped the shares from rallying 154% over the last year. Sweetgreen doesn\u2019t have a P/E because earnings are expected to be a loss of $0.71 this year. It\u2019s still expanding quickly. Sweetgreen operates 220+ restaurants.\n\nIs Sweetgreen the restaurant of the future?\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best gig economy stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the gig economy market, go directly to the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.\n\nGig Economy: An Introduction\n\nThe gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, freelance, or independent contractor positions, where individuals are hired on a temporary or flexible basis to complete specific tasks or projects. Gig workers are independent contractors who typically find work through online platforms or apps that connect them with clients or customers who are looking for various kinds of services such as coding, writing, and graphic designing, among others.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main growth catalysts for gig workers and the number of these independent contractors is rising rapidly. According to a report by MBO Partners, 45% of the US American workforce worked as independent contractors in 2023. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of independent workers grew by 89%. The report states that 40% of the gig workers said that they used online platforms to find work over the last 12 months and 47% are planning to use them over the next 12 months.\n\nGig Work Statistics\n\nAccording to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy market was valued at $14.75 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2023 and 2031, reaching $92.9 billion at the end of the forecasted period. A report by the gig economy company, Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), posted in October 2023, revealed that Gen Z and millennials are the top earners in the gig economy with 45% of the former and 44% of the latter group making at least $2,500 a month from the platform. Moreover, as of 2022, North American and Western European citizens have the highest average freelance rates at $44 and $31 per hour, respectively. It is followed by South America at $24 per hour and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe are all tied at $22 per hour.\n\nGig Economy Stocks to Thrive Amidst Secular Shift\n\nOn February 16, MoffettNathanson\u2019s senior research analyst, Michael Morton told CNBC that the last 12 months have been quite positive for the gig economy stocks. He said that initially, the industry was considered a weak domain by investors because it consumed $125 billion of investor capital between 2015 and 2022 while being focused on expanding market share rather than increasing profitability. However, over the last year, companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) have experienced a \u201cprofitability explosion\u201d due to their corporate decisions. Morton added that according to his firm, the total addressable market for the gig economy industry is around $4 trillion. He noted that grocery delivery is a trillion-dollar market that is \u201cunderpenetrated\u201d, and there is a chance that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) could also capture a noteworthy share of this market very soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicheal Morton mentioned that he has heard people refer to Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) as \u201cundeletable apps\u201d and noted several growth prospects for these companies. They are some of the biggest gig economy companies in the world. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted its FY23 earnings on February 7, reporting that its gross bookings were up 19% year-over-over, and it generated a revenue of $37.28 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The company reported a net income of $1.887 billion, compared to a net loss of $9.14 billion in FY22.\n\nWhile Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) seems to have a promising future, it faced several headwinds in the first quarter of 2024 due to which its earnings and revenues declined slightly. It reported its Q1 earnings on May 8 with a loss per share of $0.32. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s revenue was up 15%\u00a0 year-over-year at $10.1 billion, and income from operations was $172 million, up $434 million from Q1 2023. The company reached an adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% year-over-year, marking a new quarterly record for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). The company also generated a free cash flow of $4.2 billion over the trailing twelve months. The company\u2019s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, made the following remarks:\n\n\u201cQ1 marked another strong quarter for Uber. Gross Bookings growth remained consistent at 21% YoY on a constant-currency basis (22% excluding Freight), as we generated Gross Bookings of $37.7 billion. We landed just shy of our guidance midpoint, with softer Mobility activity in LatAm as we lapped heightened demand during Carnival last year, coupled with the impact of holidays shifting into Q1 of this year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly $205 million YoY or roughly 70 bps. We grew our revenue by 15% YoY on a constant-currency basis to $10.1 billion, which includes a 8 percentage point YoY headwind related to business model changes. As a reminder, certain business model changes, which have no impact on profitability, negatively impacted revenue reporting by $742 million. We expect to lap the majority of these business model changes in the second half of this year.\n\nWe converted this strong top-line growth into solid profitability, with all-time high Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% YoY, and a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.7% of Gross Bookings, an increase of 130 bps YoY. We intentionally held back some of our in-market Mobility investments with lower ROI as Q1 is typically a lighter quarter due to seasonal Mobility rider behaviors. We remain focused on striking the right balance between growth and profitability, and running Uber to deliver on the 3-year financial framework we set in February.\u201d\n\nOn February 15, DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) reported a net loss attributed to the company and shareholders of $558 million for FY23, compared to a net loss of $1.365 billion in FY22. The company generated a revenue of $8.6 billion in 2023, compared to $6.58 billion in 2022. It announced its first quarter 2024 earnings on May 1, reporting an EPS of -$0.06. The company\u2019s GAAP net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests was $25 million, down from $162 million in Q1 2023. The revenue for the quarter was $2.51 billion, up 23% year-over-year, which outperformed the analyst estimates by $60 million. At DoorDash, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:DASH) Q1 earnings call, the CEO Ravi Inukonda said:\n\n\u201c...consumer engagement and spending on the platform continues to be very strong. You can see that in our strong Q1 results, as well as the double-digit growth rate that we have driven consistently for the last two years in a row. I am not going to comment on the month-to-month, but it continues -- order frequency continues to be very good.\n\nIn fact, it's an all-time high. Retention continues to be very strong in the business, retention this past quarter is higher than the prior quarter. We feel very confident about the input metrics we are seeing and I feel very good about the guidance for Q2.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned by Michael Morton, the gig economy industry is expected to grow significantly in the future with a $4 trillion total addressable market, and companies are rushing to capture a major chunk of it. Some of the best gig economy stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).

We narrowed down our list to 12 stocks that were most widely held by institutional investors and were providing gig work opportunities.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds.

IAC Inc. (NASDAQ:IAC) is engaged in the media and Internet business. Its two core business segments are Dotdash Meredith and ANGI Homeservices. Dotdash Meredith provides digital and print publishing services. ANGI Homeservices offers a gateway to repair, remodeling, cleaning, and other services.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cA higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed\u2019s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS\u2019s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.\u201d\n\n7. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nAirbnb, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we initiated new positions in Sage Group and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and added to our existing position in Globant.\n\nAirbnb is a great business model, according to our research, due to its two-sided global network effects. For several reasons, Airbnb has a better mousetrap with its supply growth engine, with its hosts having a far lower cost of capital and more flexibility than hotels. We think private rentals should continue to grow their share of overall accommodation stays, potentially up to 30% of lodging or higher over the long term, letting the private rental gross booking value grow at a low double-digit rate. We also think Airbnb should continue to gain share within the private rental market as its global network effects strengthen, allowing for mid-teens revenue growth. With flat to rising margins over time, significant free cash flow generation, and a management team that has demonstrated its owner orientation, this should result in high-teens EPS growth over time. While the path there will not be linear, and it is a more discretionary spending-tied business, we think the long-term secular growth opportunity is very compelling.\u201d\n\n6. DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nDoorDash, Inc.

(NASDAQ:DASH) has a consensus Buy rating among 19 analysts, and its average price target of $136.75 represents an upside of 16.29% from the last price of $117.59, as of May 6.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) are some of the best gig economy stocks to buy, along with DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH).\n\nRiverPark Advisors stated the following regarding DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we initiated new GardenSM positions in DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH), GoDaddy and Vertiv. DoorDash is a technology-driven marketplace that enables couriers (Dashers) to deliver restaurant and other local orders on-demand to consumers. The company is a market leader in restaurant delivery, a business that continues to gain US market share (with healthy margins) and grow internationally. At the same time, heavy investment in newer businesses has limited company profitability. Most notably, grocery delivery is a largely untapped market due to inventory management challenges (in-person grocery shopping involves a high degree of product substitution). This business unit has been losing money. However, the company believes it has a competitive cost advantage given its existing Dasher network, and continued growth will lead to profitability\u2014something it is not getting credit for by the market. The future near-term profit trajectory from new businesses is unclear, but we view management as very rational with its spending. Either these initiatives will yield additional profitable revenue streams, or they will be deprioritized in the coming years\u2014in both scenarios, we expect solid profit growth over time.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States with the Lowest Homeless Populations Per Capita in the US 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts 20 Best Business Ideas According To Reddit\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "First-quarter earnings continued to come in better than expected last week, but it was the latest Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting which led to a pop in markets in the second half of the week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out a rate hike at the next meeting, downplayed stagflation concerns and announced the central bank would slow the pace of balance sheet reductions, a move widely seen as a slight easing of monetary policy.[1]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SRE.\n\nRate cut hopes were raised even further on Friday when U.S. jobs data for April came in weaker than expected. Nonfarm Payrolls totaled 175,000, well below the Dow Jones consensus of 240,000. Unemployment, which has stayed consistently low, rose to 3.9%.[2] All major U.S. indices ended the day up 1 - 2% on the news.\n\nOn the earnings front, all eyes were on two more of the Magnificent 7 names, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Amazon surpassed both top and bottom-line expectations, driven by strength in ad revenue which increased 24% YoY, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) which grew 17%.[3] Apple was able to beat on earnings estimates, but missed on revenues as iPhone sales sunk 10% during the quarter.[4] Despite that disappointing result, which CEO Tim Cook blamed on difficult year-over-year comparisons, the tech behemoth showed there is no shortage of cash when they announced a $110 billion buyback, the largest-ever in history. The stock shot up 6% in after-hours trading.\n\nOn the flipside, there were some consumer-centric names that didn't fare well when they reported Q1 results last week. Results from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)[5], McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)[6] and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM)[7] all showed that U.S. consumers were starting to hold back on dining out. All three missed on bottom-line expectations, while only McDonald's squeaked by on the top line. Consumers have remained resilient in the face of higher prices in the last two years, but inflation may finally be taking its toll.\n\nWith 80% of S&P 500 names reporting thus far, year-over-year earnings growth stands at 5% according to data from FactSet.[8] That's with 77% of companies surpassing analyst expectations, above the 10-year average, on par with the five-year average and just a little lighter than the one-year average of 78%. Revenues are still light, with only 61% of companies beating on the top-line, showing that many names are continuing to cost-cut their way to profitability.\n\nOn deck the last peak week of the first-quarter season\n\nThis week we get a smattering of results from different sectors, with 3,507 companies expected to report in total, the most of any week this season. Popular names to watch include Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) on Monday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Tuesday and Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues The Final Peak Week of the 1st-Quarter Season Begins Just as Earnings Hit Their Stride\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[9]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their first-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Loews Corp. (NYSE:L), Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Assurant Inc. (NYSE:AIZ), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) and NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis week will mark the final peak week of the first-quarter earnings season with 3,507 companies set to report. May 9 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,236 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 42% of companies have reported (out of our universe of 10,000-plus global names). The Final Peak Week of the 1st-Quarter Season Begins Just as Earnings Hit Their Stride\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\n[1] Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement, April 30 - May 1, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov[2] Employment Situation Summary, May 3, 2024, https://www.bls.gov[3] Amazon.com Announces First Quarter Results, April 30, 2024, https://ir.aboutamazon.com[4] Apple reports second quarter results, May 2, 2024, https://www.apple.com[5] Starbucks Reports Q2 Fiscal 2024 Results, April 30, 2024, https://investor.starbucks.com[6] McDONALD'S REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2024 RESULTS, April 30, 2024, https://corporate.mcdonalds.com[7] Yum!

        "title": "We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)",
        "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Airbnb:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.14 = US$1.5b \u00f7 (US$21b - US$10.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThus, Airbnb has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Hospitality industry average of 9.5% it's much better.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Airbnb's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Airbnb .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Airbnb Tell Us?\n\nThe trends we've noticed at Airbnb are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 14%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 272%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nAnother thing to note, Airbnb has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 48%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.\n\nOur Take On Airbnb's ROCE\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Airbnb can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 10% to its stockholders over the last three years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

        "content": "Airbnb (ABNB) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nOnline accommodations platform Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here's what investors should know.\n\nAirbnb beat analysts' revenue expectations by 2.5% last quarter, reporting revenues of $2.22 billion, up 16.6% year on year. It was a decent quarter for the company, with revenue exceeding expectations on better-than-expected 'Nights & Experiences Booked' (a key volume metric). On the other hand, its revenue growth slowed. Additionally, the company guided to adjusted EBITDA margins of \"at least 35%\" due to investments in \"incremental growth opportunities\", below expectations of a margin slightly over 36%.\n\nIs Airbnb a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Airbnb's revenue to grow 13.4% year on year to $2.06 billion, slowing from the 20.5% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.23 per share. Airbnb Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Airbnb has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 1.9% on average.\n\nLooking at Airbnb's peers in the consumer internet segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Expedia delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 8.4%, beating analysts' expectations by 2.8%, and Booking reported revenues up 16.9%, topping estimates by 3.7%. Expedia traded down 15.3% following the results while Booking was up 2.7%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Expedia's results here and Booking's results here.\n\nInvestors in the consumer internet segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices flat over the last month. Airbnb is up 1.2% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $151.9 (compared to the current share price of $162.2).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Airbnb ABNB is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 8.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 12-14% on a reported basis.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.07 billion, indicating growth of 13.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported value.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 26 cents per share, suggesting growth of 44.4% from the year-ago reported figure. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nAirbnb\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 39.9%.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Airbnb, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAirbnb, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Airbnb, Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nAirbnb\u2019s first-quarter 2024 results are expected to reflect growing Nights and Experiences booked across all geographies, owing to growing momentum among first-time bookers.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Nights and Experiences Booked is pegged at 132.1 million, indicating growth of 9.1% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nGrowing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum in Airbnb app downloads is likely to have boosted the top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across cross-border travel is likely to have acted as a tailwind for the company.\r\n\r\nAll these factors are expected to have driven growth in gross booking value (GBV) in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GBV is pegged at $22.5 billion, indicating growth of 10.3% from the reported figure in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s increasing focus on developing innovative and personalized AI interfaces is likely to have been another positive.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in active listings, owing to increasing supply across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America, is likely to have aided the company\u2019s top line during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nABNB\u2019s growing awareness around hosting and new features introduced for hosts are likely to have acted as tailwinds for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have remained an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, greater volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties and the impacts of geopolitical conflicts may have been a major concern.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Airbnb this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nAirbnb has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases:\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA has an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANET\u2019s earnings is pegged at $5.49 per share, suggesting a significant jump from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure of $1.09 per share.\r\n\r\nDocebo DCBO has an Earnings ESP of +8.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nDocebo is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 9. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DCBO\u2019s earnings is pegged at 17 cents per share, indicating growth of 88.89% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nBlink Charging BLNK has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nBlink Charging is set to report its first-quarter 2024 results on May 9.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: BP,  Saudi Aramco, Uber, and interest rates",
        "content": "BP is one of the major companies reporting their results next week. (TQS)\n\nEarnings season continues, and investors have some high expectations for some of the major companies reporting next week such as BP and Uber. In the UK, investors eagerly await the Bank of England\u2019s latest decision on interest rates.\n\nThus far, 78% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported their earnings, with 77% delivering an earnings beat.\n\nIn the Middle East, the world\u2019s most profitable company Saudi Aramco will show if oil is still king.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nBP (BP.L) \u2013 Reports on Tuesday 7 May\n\nAnalysts expect BP's profits to slow due to a lower oil price, weaker refining margins and concerns over its energy transition strategy.\n\nThe refining margin is seen shrinking almost 30% to $20.10 per barrel, consensus shows. The first-quarter $1.75bn buyback tranche expected to be repeated in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRevenues for the first quarter are forecast to be around $49,315bn, a significant decrease from around $56,951bn in Q1 2023 with pre-tax profits dropping from $8,535bn in Q1 2023 to $6,371bn in Q1 2024. Earnings per share are estimated to come in at $0.18, down from $0.27 per share last year, according to IG.\n\nInvestors will look at four headline figures when they assess the first-quarter results, said investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cThe first is underlying replacement cost profit. This is not a statutory figure, but it is one that irons out any exceptional items and also the movement in value of the company\u2019s stocks of oil and gas. The consensus analysts\u2019 forecast is $2.9bn, not far below the result in the fourth quarter of 2023 but well down from the $5bn earned in the first three months of last year,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\n\u201cThe second is net debt. BP has done an excellent job of cutting its borrowings since the terrible fright it received during the pandemic when oil and gas prices collapsed. Cost cuts, capex cuts and asset disposals have helped to cut the net debt pile to $18bn from a peak of $51bn in 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe third is capital investment, and also the mix between hydrocarbons and renewables. After spending $15.6bn in 2023, BP has steered the market to expect $16bn in 2024.\n\n\u201cFinally, attention will switch to cash returns. In 2023, BP paid out $4.8bn in dividends and $7.9bn in share buybacks. The dividend ended 2023 at 7.27 cents and analysts expect 7.6 cents a quarter on average this year, while the company has already announced $3.5bn of buybacks for the first half of 2024. Add that to the forecast dividend and BP is already expected to return $8.5bn to shareholders this year, or some 8% of its current stock market valuation.\n\nSaudi Aramco (2222.SR) \u2013 Reports on Tuesday 7 May\n\nOPEC+ output cuts are expected to hit Aramco\u2019s profit but investors will be keen to see hear updates on the extent of payouts after the oil major pledged \u00a343bn in performance-linked dividends in 2024.\n\nBenchmark oil prices remain favourable, supporting the company\u2019s \u201cstrong financial position,\u201d according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe state-owned company is set to distribute $124bn in total dividends this year, a 66% increase since 2021.\n\nAramco has been pushing its expansion in key geographies to attract new investment to the Saudi downstream sector. It has recently signed an agreement with China\u2019s Rongsheng Petrochemical) to expand its liquids-to-chemicals project at Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery Company (SASREF).\n\nIt has also entered the Pakistani fuel retail market by acquiring a 40% stake in Gas and Oil Pakistan (GO).\n\nThe stock currently has a recommendation rating of 2.9 according to Yahoo Finance data, with consensus being \u2018hold\u2019. It is currently trading at SAR29.95 (\u00a36.36) but the market puts its target price at SAR33.60 (\u00a37.13)\n\nUber (UBER) \u2013 Reports on Wednesday 8 May\n\nThe market expects Uber Technologies to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nUber is expected to post a loss of $0.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -143.2%, according to Zachs Equity Research.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $10.08bn, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe ride-hailing app was sued by thousands of London\u2019s black-cab drivers this week in a suit seeking hundreds of millions of pounds, accusing it of unlawfully operating in the capital city.\n\nTrading at $68.57, analysts have it at a $87.77 price target, with trader consensus being to \u2018buy\u2019 or \u2018strong buy\u2019 given the discount.\n\nBank of England\u2019s interest rate decision \u2013 Thursday 9 May\n\nObviously not a stock but one the biggest market moving decisions in the UK. Threadneedle Street is not expected to cut interest rates this meeting but investors should look for hints from governor Andrew Bailey and the other members of the monetary policy committee (MPC).\n\nCurrently, interest rates have been frozen at 5.25% and have remained at that level for the past few months.\n\nFinancial markets put almost zero chance on a rate cut on 9 May, after the next meeting of the MPC. They are fully pricing a first move only in September, but some economists point to June.\n\nDeutsche Bank economist Sanjay Raja said: \u201cWe expect the MPC to keep the bank rate on hold at 5.25% for a sixth consecutive meeting. But this doesn't mean that the May meeting will be uneventful. We expect the MPC to set the stage for a June rate cut.\u201d\n\nHSBC chairman Mark Tucker predicts that the BoE will lower interest rates by 1.5 percentage points by the end of next year. That would lower bank rate to 3.75%, from 5.25% today.\n\n\"We expect the ECB and Bank of England to cut rates in June, cutting by 150bps by year-end 2025. We expect the Fed to cut in September, cutting by 100bps by year-end 2025,\" Tucker said.\n\nLast month, the Bank of England's chief economist Huw Pill highlighted that the economic outlook has not changed substantially but that cuts to interest rates may be 'somewhat closer' now than they were last month.\n\n\u201cMarkets have recalibrated their expectations and now expect just two cuts this year, down to 5.00% in August and then 4.75% in December. The UK two-year gilt yield, which has an uncanny record of moving six to nine months before the Bank of England does, stands at 4.51%, to imply just three cuts in the next two years,\u201d AJ Bell said.\n\nThe OECD has warned the UK that borrowing should remain expensive until the rate of price rises eases further and stays there.\n\n\"The fiscal and monetary policy mix is adequately restrictive and should remain so until inflation returns durably to target,\" the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 's economic outlook for 2024 said.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 6 May\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nPalantir (PLTR)\n\nSimon Property (0L6P.L)\n\nBioNTech (22UA.F)\n\nTyson Foods (TSNF34.SA)\n\nLoews (LTR.BE)\n\nCoty (COTY)\n\nJLL (JLL)\n\nGoodyear (GT)\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated (COKE)\n\nTuesday 7 May\n\nUBS (UBSG.SW)\n\nUnicredit (UCG.MI)\n\nLyft (LYFT)\n\nNintendo (7974.T)\n\nWalt Disney (DIS)\n\nWednesday 8 May\n\nFox Corporation (FOXA)\n\nNewsCorp (NWSA)\n\nBMW (BMW.DE)\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)\n\nAirbnb (ABNB)\n\nToyota (7203.T)\n\nThursday 9 May\n\nNissan (7201.T)\n\nPanasonic (6752.T)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nFriday 10 May\n\nHonda (7267.T)\n\nInternational Airlines Group (IAG.L)\n\nTataMotors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nWatch: What April's slowing job growth means for the Fed<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-added-175-000-jobs-124704888.html\\\">weaker-than-expected jobs data</a> painted a softer picture of the US labor market, potentially altering the narrative surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance.

        "title": "Is Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) Trading At A 32% Discount?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Airbnb is US$232 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$158 suggests Airbnb is potentially 32% undervalued The US$152 analyst price target for ABNB is 34% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nDoes the May share price for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nView our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$3.79b US$4.63b US$5.34b US$6.31b US$7.33b US$8.09b US$8.73b US$9.27b US$9.75b US$10.2b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x11 Analyst x11 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 10.30% Est @ 7.92% Est @ 6.26% Est @ 5.10% Est @ 4.28% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5%  US$3.5k US$4.0k US$4.3k US$4.7k US$5.1k US$5.3k US$5.3k US$5.2k US$5.1k US$4.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$10b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.4%) = US$205b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$205b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$100b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$147b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$158, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Airbnb as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.106. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Airbnb\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for ABNB.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "content": "A stock market crash isn\u2019t always a bad thing. While people nearing retirement should approach the risk of a\u00a0crash\u00a0with more caution, it\u00a0allows younger investors\u00a0to buy fundamentally solid companies at more reasonable valuations. We\u2019ll look at some of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nInvestors who capitalize on market uncertainty and load up on top-tier companies can be in a good position after a few years. However, it\u2019s\u00a0important\u00a0to know which corporations to consider before a correction or a crash happens. That way, you aren\u2019t rushing to make decisions and can craft a plan leading up to market turbulence. These are some of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a clear leader in the online advertising and cloud computing industries.\u00a0The corporation\u2019s Q1 2024 results further reflected\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0vast market share in those industries. Revenue increased by 15%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while net income jumped by 57%\u00a0year-over-year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe high net income growth comes as the company implements more cost-cutting measures while accelerating its top-line growth.\u00a0Continued\u00a0growth in the cloud and artificial intelligence initiatives can lead to more growth\u00a0moving forward.\u00a0Google Cloud in particular has seen rising profits. The segment generated $191 million in Q1 2023. Operating income jumped to $900 million in Q1 2024.\n\nRevenue also grew at a\u00a0higher\u00a0pace for Google Cloud. Net sales came in at $9.57 billion compared to $7.45 billion in the same period last year. That\u2019s a 28.4% year-over-year increase which outpaces Alphabet\u2019s overall revenue growth. The stock has a reasonable 26 P/E ratio which should continue to shrink as the company expands its profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet isn\u2019t the only advertising giant up for grabs.\u00a0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has also\u00a0been fulfilling\u00a0its end of the bargain for investors. The stock has gained 25% year-to-date and is up by an impressive 78% over the past year.\u00a0It\u2019s also another one of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nThe stock recently plunged after\u00a0Q1 2024 earnings and is in correction territory. However, the earnings report was solid despite the market\u2019s reaction. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year while net income surged by 117% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s 7% year-over-year daily active user growth across all platforms was also solid. Meta Platforms now has 3.24 billion daily active users. The firm repurchased $14.64 billion worth of shares while distributing $1.27 billion to investors as dividends. Meta Platforms has achieved this level of success while trimming its headcount by 10% year-over-year.\n\nMeta Platforms is making strides in artificial intelligence, but advertising is undoubtedly the\u00a0main\u00a0revenue driver.\u00a0Advertising accounted for $35.6 billion of the company\u2019s $36.5 billion in total revenue. Only\u00a02.2% of the company\u2019s revenue did not come from advertising.\u00a0If Meta Platforms finds another robust income stream like Alphabet did with Google Cloud, the stock can continue to soar.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) Hotel room\n\nSource: Dragon Images / Shutterstock\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) has built one of the top hotel chains in the industry. The firm has nearly 8,800 properties in 139 countries and territories. Marriott International and its investors have benefitted from the travel boom. Shares are up by 69% over the past five years and trades at a 23.5 P/E ratio.\n\nThe momentum continued in\u00a0Q4 2023 as the company reported $23.7 billion in revenue. It was\u00a0a 14% year-over-year increase. Net income grew by 31% year-over-year to reach $3.1 billion. The firm expanded its profit margins and\u00a0has\u00a0raised its quarterly dividend payout above pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0Investors received $0.52 per share in 2023, and the company\u00a0is expected\u00a0to announce a dividend hike in May.\n\nThe hotel chain can also benefit as\u00a0Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) gets more expensive. Airbnb is still a competitor in the hotel industry, but its main appeal in the early stages was more affordable pricing.\u00a0Now,\u00a0there isn\u2019t much of a gap between Airbnb and hotel prices, and hotels offer more amenities.\u00a0Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has stated his desire to make Airbnb feel affordable again. As Airbnb gets more expensive, consumers may flock\u00a0over\u00a0to hotels more often.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has been attracting younger cardholders while raising its profit margins. The fintech firm trades at 19.5x earnings and has outperformed the market. Shares are up by 26% year-to-date and have soared by 98% over the past five years. It\u2019s another one of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nConsumer preferences change, and some\u00a0products and services may gain more demand while others may go out of style.\u00a0However, most individuals will always use credit or debit cards for their purchases. These cards have become a core foundation of economic activity, and American Express has\u00a0been benefitting\u00a0from this multi-decade trend.\n\nThe fintech firm reported solid financials in the\u00a0first quarter of 2024.\u00a0Revenue increased by 11%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while net income jumped by 34%\u00a0year-over-year.\u00a0American Express has been expanding its profit margins and wrapped up Q1 2024 with a 16.9% net profit margin. The company set growth objectives beyond 2026 that suggest revenue and profit margins will continue to grow.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) offers financial software including industry-leading products like Quickbooks and Turbotax.\u00a0The stock is\u00a0off to a slow start\u00a0with\u00a0a 5% year-to-date gain.\u00a0However, it\u2019s also up by 43% over the past year and has soared by 154% over the past five years.\n\nAnalysts believe the stock can continue to rally. The average price target suggests a\u00a012% upside from current levels.\u00a0Intuit is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 21 analysts and the highest price target is $775 per share. That price target\u00a0implies a 22.4% gain.\n\nThe company had another successful quarter and reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 20% year-over-year. Intuit anticipates full-year revenue growth to range from 11% to 12%. GAAP diluted EPS growth\u00a0is expected\u00a0to range from 11% to 15%.\u00a0Intuit generates double-digit net profit margins, and guidance suggests\u00a0that\u00a0its profit margins will continue\u00a0to grow.\n\nBadger Meter (BMI) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Badger Meter Inc (BMI).\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBadger Meter (NYSE:BMI) manufactures water metering technology and flow measurement solutions.\u00a0The company\u2019s technology is\u00a0useful for\u00a0measuring\u00a0the quality of water and improving operational efficiencies of utility companies.\n\nBadger Meter is a mid-cap stock with a $5.5 billion market cap. It also trades at a 54 P/E ratio and offers a 0.58% yield. The company has an impressive dividend growth rate to make up for its low yield.\u00a0The company\u00a0hiked its dividend from $0.225 per share to $0.27 per share\u00a0in 2023. That\u2019s\u00a0a 20% year-over-year increase, and\u00a0Badger Meter is due for an announced dividend hike in August.\n\nThe company posted solid\u00a0Q1 2024 financials that were\u00a0highlighted by a 23% year-over-year increase in total sales. While total sales came in at $196.3 million diluted EPS soared by 50% year-over-year to reach $0.99 per share.\u00a0Badger Meter generated record quarterly revenue, operating profit, and EPS results.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been\u00a0trouncing\u00a0the stock market in recent years. Shares are up\u00a0by\u00a041% year-to-date and have soared\u00a0by\u00a0346% over the past five years. The\u00a0fast food\u00a0restaurant chain delivers healthier food options which has made consumers willing to pay higher prices.\n\nThe company\u00a0has raised menu prices four times in the past two years. Chipotle attributed the price hikes to the state of the economy, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the fast food giant from reporting\u00a0strong\u00a0financials.\n\nRevenue jumped by 14.1% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 2024. Net income grew\u00a0at a faster clip\u00a0and was up by 23.2% year-over-year. That growth rate helped the company reach $359.3 million in net earnings for the quarter. Chipotle still plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024. More than 80% of these restaurants will have a Chipotlane. These additions have been a boon for the company, as digital sales represented 36.5% of total food and beverage revenue.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG.

        "content": "This article looks at beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. If you wish to skip our analysis of over tourism and sustainable travel, please proceed to 5 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.\n\nUNWTO predicts that destinations around the world will host approximately 1.5 billion international tourists in 2024, the highest volume ever recorded. As wanderlust beckons travelers to traverse through narrow cobblestone streets, dive into underwater shipwrecks, and groove to raucous beats, it comes hand in hand with the threat of overtourism.\n\nOvertourism\n\nOvertourism is essentially the idea of a greater than optimal number of tourists visiting any area. If left unchecked, excessive tourists can have economic, social, and environmental repercussions that impact the longevity and sustainability of any destination. One of the major reasons for overtourism is the availability of cheap accommodation, courtesy of unrestricted house rentals. Companies such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) offer property owners the ability to rent out to tourists for pennies on the dollar, inadvertently causing destinations to become congested with heaps of tourists. Tourists can also utilize groups on Facebook, a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), to obtain informal accommodations.\n\nOther social media sites such as TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram, the latter being operated by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), can both fuel and curb overtourism. Hawaii, one of the places where overtourism is most common, has been forced to take drastic actions, including the removal of a World War II landmark. In April 2024, the Honolulu City Government announced that the island\u2019s famous Haiku Stairs, often referred to as the Stairway to Heaven, would be removed. The decision came as a consequence of illegal trespassing by tourists to visit the stairs, which has only worsened due to social media trends such as #HaikuStairs.\n\nSustainable Tourism\n\nIn response, countries negatively affected by overtourism have begun implementing protocols to limit rental accommodations such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) to regulate tourist inflows. Starting July 2024, Vienna has placed a citywide restriction on house rentals meaning that owners can only rent out units to tourists for 90 days per year. Similarly, in Berlin property owners using platforms such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) must now obtain permits to rent out their accommodations. These measures are part of a wider effort to make tourism sustainable.\n\nIn addition to governments, corporations around the world have shown increased commitment towards sustainable tourism. Since 2019, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) has been a part of a sustainable travel coalition led by Travalyst. In 2022, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) became a part of the same coalition, demonstrating its devotion to minimizing the negative implications of tourism. Moreover, there is a belief among organizations such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) that the next generation of travelers is looking for ways to vacation responsibly.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOur research shows travelers are looking for ways to minimize their footprint while traveling and support local communities and cultures, and we see travelers turning to our platform for inspiration and guidance to inform their decisions.\u201d\n\n-Aditi Mohapatra, VP of Global Social Impact & Sustainability, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE).\n\nThis belief is supported by other travel companies, as confirmed in a survey carried out by Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW). The study, in which Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW) surveyed 400 destination management companies in Europe, Africa, and Asia, showed that 84% of providers believe that sustainability is becoming more of a determining factor in how travelers plan their trips. 42% of providers say travelers are actively asking for sustainability options from them, according to Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW).\n\nVacationers are becoming more conscious of how tourists are ruining destinations, with many looking to ensure that no more beautiful places in the world are ruined by overtourism. According to a study carried out by Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) in 2023, 76% of travelers say they want to travel more sustainably. Our article on Spectacular Floating Hotels Around the World highlights that #SustainableTourism and #ConsiousConsumer have been some of the most viral travel trends on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) websites in recent times.\n\nAs governments, corporations, and vacationers converge in the effort to make tourism sustainable and prevent tourism damaging places of natural beauty, some destinations continue to suffer at the hands of overtourism. If left unchecked, these could be places you\u2019ll no longer be able to visit in five years\u2019 time. To remind ourselves of what we stand to lose, let\u2019s take a look at beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. 20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism\n\n20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism, we began by combing through similar lists on the web. We compiled over 10 notable sources such as The Travel,CN Traveler, and Business Insider, to develop a preliminary list of beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. Using these lists, we developed a scorecard with 2 metrics. The first metric was the frequency of destinations in our sources. The second metric was a ranking factor based on the damage sustained by each place due to tourism. This was scored subjectively by examining news articles, tourist reviews, and reports from relevant authorities & the UN.\n\nIn the scope of this article, damage sustained due to tourism consists of pollution, vandalism, environmental degradation, inflationary impacts, and excessive erosion/ structural damage due to overcrowding. Our ranking factor was then scaled to a number between 0-1. By accumulating the frequency and ranking factors, we calculated our Insider Monkey scores. Once sorted in descending order, the first 20 destinations were selected as beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. Please note that the ranking presented in this article is subjective and based on our assessment criteria. We acknowledge that perceptions of beauty and the impacts of overtourism may vary.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are 20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.\n\n20. Kyoto, Japan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.3\n\nThe cultural city of Kyoto is famous for its ancient streets, shrines, and temples. Owing to unbridled tourist visits, the city struggled to maintain order, with frequent trespassing on private properties and harassment of local geishas. In response, the government has imposed tourist taxes and penalties for violation of the city\u2019s policies.\n\n19. Hawaii, USA\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.9\n\nDue to an overwhelming number of tourists each year, housing and living costs on the islands have soared, preventing locals from being able to afford their homes. Excessive foot traffic on hiking trails and beaches is contributing to a loss of natural beauty and wildlife. There has been significant debate on whether the island should ban, or at least limit, short-term rental accommodations. However, no such permanent measure has been enforced so far.\n\n18. The Great Pyramids, Egypt\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.5\n\nThe only remaining ancient wonder of the world is struggling to cope with mass tourism. The sheer foot traffic of vacationers has caused immense soil erosion and structural damage to the Great Pyramids, making them one of the most beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. In addition, continuous attempts by visitors to scale the pyramids are only worsening the situation.\n\n17. Bali, Indonesia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.6\n\nThe city of Bali is one of the many beautiful places destroyed by pollution, so much so that in 2017 authorities declared a \u201ctrash emergency\u201d due to an abhorrent amount of plastic waste being dumped on its popular beaches. As of 2024, the Bali Provincial Government has imposed a tourist tax of 150,000 Rupiah to combat overtourism.\n\n16. Cozumel, Mexico\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.8\n\nThe island of Cozumel is one of the most popular beaches in the world, especially among cruise tourists. However, scuba diving and cruise ships have damaged much of the coral reefs that lie below its azure waters. Despite this, Cozumel hosted over 1.6 million tourists in the first quarter of 2024, although some of the diving sites have been closed in an effort to sustain its coral population.\n\n15. Fja\u00f0r\u00e1rglj\u00fafur Canyon, Iceland\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.1\n\nThis majestic canyon was featured in HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones and Justin Bieber\u2019s music video I\u2019ll Show You, after which there was a sharp rise in tourists visiting the area. Over fears of damage to its natural beauty, the canyon was fenced off in 2019, however, tourists continue to illegally enter the canyon, increasing the risk of it becoming a beautiful place in the world ruined by overtourism.\n\n14. Stonehenge, UK\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.4\n\nThe neolithic structure was severely compromised as tourists chipped fragments of the structure as souvenirs. For several decades, tourists have been banned from entering the stone circle, however, it is still one of the most overcrowded spots on the planet.\n\n13. Great Wall, China\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.6\n\nAccording to National Geographic, approximately 30% of the Great Wall is crumbling into ruin. Natural erosion, foot traffic, and development projects are all factors that have made this destination a beautiful place ruined by overtourism. Since 2019, a cap of 65,000 daily visitors has been imposed.\n\n12. Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.6\n\nAmsterdam is one of the cities in Europe that have imposed stringent policies on rental accommodations to combat overtourism. Currently, Airbnb rentals are limited to 30 nights a year per property, and property owners have to obtain a permit before renting out any accommodation, with any subsequent income being subject to taxation.\n\n11. Angkor Wat, Cambodia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.7\n\nGraffiti and foot traffic to the temple have made it one of the most beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. In addition, a shortage of water supply has caused the water table to drop significantly, which in turn puts the soil underneath the city at risk of sinking.\n\n10. Boracay, Philippines\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.8\n\nConsidered one of Asia\u2019s most overrated travel destinations, Boracay Island has suffered immensely from both overcrowding and its subsequent pollution. In 2018, the island\u2019s popular tourist spots were sealed for six months. Since then, there has been an effort to make tourism sustainable which has faced fierce opposition from those struggling to maintain their livelihood.\n\n9. Mount Everest, Nepal\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.5\n\nThe last place on earth you would expect to witness a traffic jam would be the slopes of Mount Everest, but that is where mass tourism has brought us. Even more appalling are the piles of garbage and litter left for local sherpas to collect. Between 2019 and 2023, 110 tons of waste were collected in a Mountain Cleanup Campaign, and this cleanup is expected to resume in 2024.\n\n8. Dubrovnik, Croatia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.6\n\nThe Old Town area of the city featured as King\u2019s Landing in HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones, causing a huge influx of tourists into an already congested space. The increase in foot traffic and cruise visitors threatened to cause irreparable damage to the ancient structures, after which the city has placed a cap on the number of cruise ships and visitors allowed to enter the city.\n\n7. Barcelona, Spain\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.7\n\nHosting one of the largest ports in the Mediterranean, Barcelona hosts cruise ships all year round. Apart from inflated housing prices, mass tourism places a strain on the city\u2019s public transport and waste management. Recently, the city has increased its tourist tax to \u20ac3.25 to ensure this beautiful place isn\u2019t ruined by overtourism.\n\n6. Rome, Italy\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 7.6\n\nMany of Rome\u2019s most popular sites, such as the mighty Colosseum have suffered at the hands of mass tourism, with graffiti and burglary of stones being rampant. Similarly, the city\u2019s famous Spanish Steps were embellished by wine stains and dried gum, so much so that the city banned tourists from even sitting on the steps in 2019.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in Florida That You\u2019ve Never Heard Of 12 Most Hated Countries in Europe 15 Tax-Friendly Countries To Consider for Your Retirement\n\nDisclosure: none.\u00a020 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Want to spend the night in a Paris museum or a house owned by Prince? Airbnb plans to list them",
        "content": "In a mad mix of game-show glitter and marketing flash, Airbnb is offering customers a chance to spend a night in a Paris museum, stay in houses mocked up to look like movie settings, or sleep surrounded by eight Ferrari racing cars.\n\nThose and other chimerical listings are part of a splashy new campaign by the short-term rental giant, which wants to portray itself as a company that sells experiences and not just alternatives to staying in a hotel.\n\nCEO Brian Chesky announced the 11 temporary listings \u2014 Airbnb is calling them \u201cicons\u201d \u2014 at an event Wednesday in Los Angeles.\n\nThe San Francisco company hit upon the idea for the publicity caper after seeing the response to a Barbie-themed house in Malibu, California, it listed last year in conjunction with a hit movie about the Mattel fashion doll. The formula is the same: link a promotion to a pop-culture product, celebrity or event.\n\nAnd don't be boring.\n\n\u201cWe're not historically known for making anything. We're a platform,\u201d Chesky said in an interview. \u201cI think it's really great to show what it looks like when suddenly you can step into our vision and our imagination. I think it's going to keep Airbnb top of mind.\"\n\nUnlike the rental platform's typical listed properties, Airbnb is practically giving away its \u201cicons.\u201d Chesky said the company will invite people to fill out a profile and explain why they want one of the listings, and Airbnb will pick about 4,000 winners over the course of the year. He said winners will be able to book the featured properties or events for free or at prices under $100.\n\nOne of the exotic opportunities is an overnight stay at the Musee d\u2019Orsay in Paris. Chesky said Airbnb recruited Mathieu Lehanneur \u2014 he designed the torch for this summer's Paris Olympics \u2014 to convert the clock room atop the museum into a bedroom.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the torch is in the bedroom with you,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cYou get the entire museum all to yourself. This is literally night at the museum. It gets even better because you step outside the bedroom on to the terrace, you have the single best seat in the house for the opening ceremony\" of the Olympics, which will take place on the River Seine.\n\nFor those preferring a U.S. setting, Airbnb is listing a house in New Mexico detailed to look like the one from the 2009 Pixar-Disney animated film, \u201cUp.\" Chesky said Airbnb paid to build the house from scratch and attach 8,000 balloons to mimic the helium-filled ones the central character in the movie uses to make the house fly.\n\nThe Airbnb version won't fly, but Chesky said guests will be able to watch a crane lift the New Mexico house 50 feet off the ground.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think we maybe won\u2019t have them inside the house when we lift it, just for safety reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the listings will be one-time events, including the sleepover at the the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, Italy, a living room performance by rapper Doja Cat, and an evening with comedian Kevin Hart in his members-only lounge. The \u201cUp\u201d house and a mansion in New York made to look like the one in \u201cX-Men\u201d Marvel comics will be available for three or four months. A Minneapolis house owned by Prince that was featured in the film \u201cPurple Rain\u201d will be available for a year, according to Airbnb.\n\nThe company won't say how much it spent to acquire rights, dress up the properties, and pay the celebrities involved. Airbnb made a $4.8 billion profit last year and ended 2023 with nearly $6.9 billion in cash. Enough to repeat the \u201cicons\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cThese 11 are the beginning,\" Chesky said. \u201cWe have a lot more under development.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +44.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.07 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Airbnb?\n\nFor Airbnb, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -53.40%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Airbnb will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Airbnb would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of +13.43%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAirbnb doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This article looks at the 20 natural healing hot springs to visit in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of self-care tourism and hydrotherapy, please proceed directly to 5 Natural Healing Hot Springs to Visit in the World.\n\nIt is no secret that tourism was one of the hardest impacted industries during the pandemic. Our article on Least Visited Countries in the World reveals that due to COVID-19 there was a decrease of 2.6 billion international arrivals all over the globe between 2020 and 2022. As of 2023, international tourist arrivals have recovered to 88% of pre-pandemic levels, with strong indications that 2024 is the year when the tourism industry surpasses pre-pandemic levels in terms of volume and revenue.\n\nWhile COVID-19 may have caused tourism to come to a grinding halt, it also helped reshape the industry. Unlike conventional tourism, the rejuvenated version of tourism is influenced by travel trends such as set-jetting, destination dupes, and sustainable tourism, all of which are featured in Unpack 24, a list of travel trends by Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE). If you're interested in knowing more about these trends, check out our take on Best Places for Adventure Travel in the World and Spectacular Floating Hotels Around The World.\n\nSelf-care Tourism\n\nThe idea of self-care has become a focal point of tourism in the post-pandemic environment. The wellness industry is set to increase from $6.3 trillion in 2024 to $8.5 trillion in 2027. As such, wellness tourism is one of the fastest-growing segments in this industry and is expected to surge past $1 trillion in 2024 and reach $1.4 trillion by 2027. Individuals can explore some of the best wellness retreats within the US if they're looking to improve their personal well-being.\n\nIn response to the growing popularity of self-care vacations, brands such as Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H) are diversifying and improving their wellness services. Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR), under its JW Marriott brand, launched a \u201cStay in the Moment\u201d campaign in the Asia-Pacific market, which provides experiences focusing on personal well-being and enrichment.\n\n\"The 'Stay in the Moment' campaign focuses on the discerning luxury traveler who seeks well-being, mindfulness, and profound connections, all the elements that speak to the spirit of the JW Marriott brand.\"\n\n-John Toomey, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer Asia Pacific (Excluding China), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR).\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H) showcased its commitment to wellness by launching the Hyatt Wellbeing Collective, a portfolio of over 30 hotels and resorts that offer customized itineraries for wellness vacationers.\n\n\u201cAt Hyatt, we\u2019re setting a new standard of wellbeing for travel, making sure every touch point is crafted with meaning and intent to support all facets of wellbeing.\u201d\n\n-TJ Abrams, Vice President, Global Wellbeing, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H).\n\nHydrotherapy\n\nIf you go through our article on Best Wellness Retreats in the US, you will realize that wellness retreats aren\u2019t just about spa treatments and foot baths. This is because tourists tend to take these vacations to work towards a specific goal such as stress management, weight loss, or recovering from burnout. A study by Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR) in 2023 showed how wellness travelers are looking to incorporate intensive exercises and mentally stimulating activities into their vacations. The study showed that 65% of respondents expressed interest in active wellness activities such as jiu-jitsu or kickboxing classes, while 58% wanted more mindful activities such as yoga and meditation.\n\nPoolside activities are a prominent activity in the itinerary for any vacation, with tourists relishing any opportunity to be cradled by gentle lapping water. According to Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), the most booked categories for a family vacation during the recent winter season were poolside stays, beaches with surfing activities, and golf courses. Many hotels and wellness resorts around the world have begun to infuse the gentle arts of yoga and meditation into water-based settings such as pools and lakes. Similarly, a phenomenon named \"Hot Potting\" has also become an increasingly popular activity among wellness travelers.\n\nHot Potting is the activity of soaking in a warm, often mineral-rich, body of water for therapeutic purposes. Bathing in hot pools is an activity that dates back thousands of years and is considered to have numerous health benefits. According to a study published in the North American Journal of Medical Sciences, hydrotherapy has several benefits such as relieving muscle soreness and increasing circulation. Another study implies that balneotherapy can be a non-pharmacological treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nOne of the things that has hindered the popularity of natural healing hot springs is the risk of burns and even fatal accidents in case the water is too warm. Moreover, in unstable conditions, jets of near-boiling water can erupt into thermal pools spontaneously, making them extremely dangerous to swim in. However, there are plenty of natural healing hot springs to visit in the world that provide immense therapeutic benefits without such risks. Join us as we look at the greatest natural healing hot springs to visit in the world.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of natural healing hot springs to visit in the world, we initially picked out the most recommended natural healing hot springs to visit in the world on the internet. We used 10+ sources including CN Traveler, Travel & Leisure, and Trip Savvy to develop a shortlist. Further research was narrowed down to these places only. This approach also allowed us to obtain an initial score for each park based on the number of times it was recommended across different sources. Once this list was obtained, we used online ratings from sources such as Trip Advisor and Trip.com as other metrics for our rankings. The cumulative score for each place was summed, based on which we sorted our list in descending order. The top 20 places were chosen as the natural healing hot springs to visit in the world.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "Even in a still-challenging macro environment, you can make your money work for you and gradually move closer to your financial goals.\u00a0Investing in stocks can be a great way to boost your portfolio and compound returns that add to your wealth-building journey through the years.\n\nIf you have $3,000 to invest -- money that you don't need for near-term financial obligations and can leave in your portfolio for several years at least -- here are two phenomenal growth stocks to consider.\n\n1. Fiverr\n\nFiverr International(NYSE: FVRR) is witnessing a surge of growth as the freelance platform capitalizes on the ways that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the gig economy. You could be forgiven for wondering how a company that revolves around facilitating the relationship between buyers and sellers of freelance services would fare amid the AI revolution.\n\nWhile it's still early days, Fiverr's moves to refine its services so that buyers find the help they want and freelancers can cater to buyers' changing needs seem to be paying off handsomely. The company has added a growing collection of AI-driven services over the last year. These include not only new categories of AI-centric skills that freelancers can offer, but also the launch of services like Fiverr Neo, which uses AI to match buyers and sellers for projects.\n\nManagement estimates that AI drove a 4% lift to business in 2024, noting that buyers are focusing more on complex services over simple services. Buyers can be anyone from individuals to large businesses.\n\nComplex services are those that require a person to deliver an end result, but where AI can help drive better efficiency. One example would be mobile app development.\n\nSimple services include jobs like translation or voice-over work that Fiverr management estimates are more likely to experience shifts from the adoption of AI.\n\nWith Fiverr buyers focusing more on complex services, these are becoming a larger driver of its business, an important sign that it doesn't have to be too reliant on growth from simple services. In fact, about 32% of the platform's gross merchandise value (GMV) was derived from complex services in 2023. Complex services GMV rose 29% in 2023, more than double the growth rate in 2022.\n\nOn the flip side, looking back at the full-year 2023, 23% of Fiverr's GMV was derived from simple services. Not only are complex services accounting for more of GMV, but management has also noted that the average transaction for complex services is approximately 30% larger.\n\nRevenue grew 7% year over year to $361 million in 2023, and the company showed a profit according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Net income totaled $3.7 million, compared to a net loss of $72 million in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiverr is also expanding its take rate, and spend per buyer was up 6% at the end of last year compared to the prior one. This business looks to be headed in the right direction, and investors might want to take note now.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) continues to demonstrate that the ongoing travel resurgence is just one piece of its growth story. The company's financials look great, the business is expanding at a solid pace, and growth versus pre-pandemic days is even more impressive than its year-over-year figure.\n\nManagement is working to make the business of hosting a stay on Airbnb just as mainstream as booking a stay. Not only are travelers flocking to the platform, but active listings are also surging as more people see the income opportunity for listing homes.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, the company had more than 5 million hosts globally. Active listings on the platform surpassed 7.7 million by the close of the year, an 18% increase from the year-ago period and an all-time high for the business. Hosts earned close to $60 billion in 2023.\n\nAirbnb has continued to update its platform to grow its number of hosts and guests. Easier price-setting tools, discounts on long-term stays, and improved payment options are just some of the hundreds of upgrades in the last few years. Management said in the 2023 shareholder letter that host cancellations dropped 36% in the final quarter of last year compared to the same period in 2022.\n\nBoth short-term and long-term bookings are key drivers of growth for Airbnb. As of the final quarter of 2023, long-term stays (bookings of 28 days or more) represented 19% of gross nights booked on the platform. Now, about 25% of all long-term stays booked are for three months or more, meaning that people are not just using it for vacation travel.\n\nRevenue was about $10 billion in 2023, up 18% from the prior year and 106% from four years ago. Profits for the 12-month period totaled around $5 billion, while free cash flow came to just shy of $4 billion.\n\nAirbnb benefits from all types of travel spending, catering to travelers of all budgets and needs. With a profitable, cash-rich, and asset-light business, this stock looks like a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Fiverr International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Fiverr International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Fiverr International wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "When it comes to finding tech stocks, investors tend to gravitate to the top stocks in the industry. These companies tend to combine faster-than-average growth rates with solid balance sheets, making them a frequent choice.\n\nHowever, timing can temporarily reduce the popularity of such choices. Although investors may like Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance, they may stay away due to a high valuation. Conversely, Intel's decline and periodic setbacks may leave investors questioning whether one should consider it a \"top\" tech stock.\n\nStill, other top tech stocks may look more like buys now. Investors may want to consider Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB).\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has met with unexpected struggles in recent months. A release of an upgraded version of OpenAI's ChatGPT appeared to catch the company off guard. And given OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, many wondered whether Google's search and cloud platforms could stay competitive.\n\nNonetheless, it is likely too early to count the Google parent out. It has utilized AI for more than 20 years and became an \"AI-first\" company in 2016, so it remains a player in that industry.\n\nAlso, it has responded with its own generative AI product called Gemini. While it has not escaped controversy, Alphabet has shown it is not going to surrender to its competitors.\n\nMoreover, it holds about $111 billion in liquidity, a cash hoard matched by few companies. Thus, if its researchers cannot invent competing in-house products, it can likely buy the technology it needs.\n\nIndeed, Alphabet has sustained revenue growth amid struggles, as its $307 billion in revenue for 2023 rose 9% yearly. Also, its net income for that year of $74 billion is above 2022 levels and has nearly caught up to the 2021 earnings of $76 billion, when many of its customers were in lockdown.\n\nFinally, despite doubts, the stock has generally increased, and the 27 P/E ratio is right at its five-year average. Such conditions make now an excellent time to add shares steadily.\n\n2. Qualcomm\n\nAmid falling sales of its 5G chips in recent months, Qualcomm seems to have fallen out of favor. A sluggish economy reduced sales in past quarters, and with increasing investments in its Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automotive segments, it faces uncertainty as it prepares for the day when smartphone usage may fall.\n\nHowever, the company has not let the rise of AI pass it by. Its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip is AI-enabled, likely bringing more AI capabilities to smartphones. Moreover, it applies AI technology to signal reception, improving overall communication quality.\u00a0This should lead to a significantly improved performance for its smartphone chipsets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most recent financial results indicate the comeback may have already begun. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 24, 2023), revenue of $9.9 billion rose 5% from year-ago levels and improved from the 19% revenue decline in fiscal 2023.\n\nAlso, net income in fiscal Q1 was $2.7 billion, a 24% yearly increase. That should go a long way in turning profitability around, after it fell 44% in fiscal 2023.\n\nOver the last six months especially, investors have steadily turned more bullish on Qualcomm, and the stock gained 33% over the previous year as a result.\n\nAlso, even though its valuation has climbed, its 23 P/E ratio compares well to other AI chip designers. Those factors should bode well for Qualcomm as it continues leading the smartphone chipset market.\n\n3. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb has stood out for applying technology to transform the short-term rental industry. The company's platform has allowed it to turn any room or residential unit into a potential vacation property. Its increased recognition attracts prospective landlords and tenants alike, creating a virtuous cycle that leads to more nights and experiences getting booked on its platform.\n\nAdditionally, AI has played a critical role in its success. That technology helped with challenges such as pricing a property in a specific market, vetting prospective tenants, and preventing disruptive parties from taking place.\n\nOverall, it has become an ecosystem that steadily grows its reach and revenue. In 2023, revenue was $9.9 billion, 18% more than the previous year.\n\nAdmittedly, general and administrative expenses more than doubled due to a spike in operational and business taxes, causing expenses to rise by 29%. However, a $2.7 billion income tax benefit and a spike in interest income allowed it to earn $4.8 billion, a 153% yearly gain.\n\nInvestors have largely overlooked the higher operating costs, and Airbnb stock rose nearly 30% over the last year.\n\nAlso, while the income tax benefit led to an artificially low P/E ratio of 22, the forward P/E of about 35 indicates the market has reasonably priced the stock. That should bode well for investors as Airbnb transforms the short-term rental industry through technology.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "15 Cheapest European Countries to Visit in 2024",
        "content": "This article looks at the 15 cheapest European countries to visit in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Tourism in Europe and ways to budget your vacation, you may skip ahead to 5 Cheapest European Countries to Visit in 2024.\n\nTourism in Europe\n\nEurope is by far the most popular tourist destination among all continents. According to UNWTO, in 2023, 54% of the world's international tourist arrivals were in Europe, with the southern/Mediterranean region being the most visited destination. Europe is extremely appealing for tourists due to its friendly visa policies, a diverse range of destinations, and the fact that it is considered safer than other global destinations.\n\nLike most of the world, tourism in Europe has still not managed to recover to pre-pandemic volumes. In 2023, Europe had 700 million tourist arrivals across the continent, which was 94% of the arrivals witnessed in 2019. This is despite the fact that many southern European and Mediterranean destinations have surpassed pre-COVID levels of tourism. The European Travel Commission reports that countries such as Serbia, Portugal, and Montenegro all hosted 10% more tourists in 2023 than they had in 2019. In comparison, 65% of destinations in Europe are still falling short of pre-pandemic volumes. The most sluggish recovery has been witnessed in the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, each of which has failed to attain even 75% of pre-COVID tourist arrivals. This stark disparity in the recovery of tourism across the continent poses a challenge.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the enormous volume of tourists that fly over to Europe each year, many of its most exquisite locations continue to be dejected in favor of hotspots such as the beaches of Ibiza, the bustling streets of Paris, or the canals of Venice. Owing to such a rapid inflow of tourists into only a handful of destinations, the sustainability of tourism in Europe falls under threat. Recently, more and more vacationers are becoming critical of tourist hotspots, criticizing them for being \u201ctourist traps\u201d and are instead looking to venture towards less crowded destinations. Another factor that unsettles tourists is the rate of inflation witnessed in post-pandemic tourism. According to Allianz Research, the daily rate for a hotel room (global median) jumped to $212 in the first quarter of 2023, up from $156 in Q1 2022 and $129 in Q1 2021. Moreover, a recent survey by Travel Weekly showed that 87% of European travelers are taking measures to reduce costs in their vacations. This includes opting for cheaper accommodations, reducing the budget used on excursions, and switching towards more affordable destinations.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more and more tourists become irked by the overcrowded and inflated vacation experiences in particular hotspots, it is possible that tourists in 2024 will set their sights on destinations offering budget-friendly vacations with similar itineraries. With websites such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB), Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG), and Sun Life Financial, Inc. (NYSE: SLF), tourists have the opportunity to map out their entire vacations at the most affordable prices, exploring new and exciting destinations in the process.\n\nBudgeting your trip\n\nSome would argue that the true beauty of Europe lies in destinations that have been spared from the tirade of excessive tourist inflows. In the past, there were either no avenues for the common tourist to arrange a vacation to such areas, or they would be considered as being unreliable, unsafe, and unfit for tourists. However, over the last decade, this perception has shifted as people have access to more and more avenues to plan trips to some of the most remote recesses of the world.\n\nWebsites like Booking, property of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG), and Budget Your\u00a0 Trip provide data for locations, resorts, and excursions. This enables previously unknown tourist spots all over Europe to market themselves without investing the same level of resources as world-renowned hoteling brands. Tourists can use Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) and similar services to break down each leg of their trips into exact monetary terms, without being beguiled by the fame of prominent destinations.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) is the world's largest platform for alternative accommodation. Alternative accommodation is a relatively new manner of lodging that involves living in rented apartments, hostels, or even a spare guestroom. In comparison to hotels, such accommodation is cheaper and can be found in rural travel destinations as well. In providing this service, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) has diverted a large number of tourists away from saturated hot-spots towards less crowded communities.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to visit a cheap European country in 2024, you may also consider obtaining travel insurance such as the packages offered by Sun Life Financial, Inc. (NYSE: SLF). These cover medical treatment and hospitalization bills in the unfortunate circumstance that you or a family member fall ill. Obtaining insurance from companies such as Sun Life Financial, Inc. (NYSE: SLF) allows you to venture into the wild and vivaciously enjoy your vacation.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of 15 cheapest European countries to visit in 2024, we traversed through similarly recommended lists on the web to develop a shortlist of budget-friendly countries. For these countries, we used Google Flights to obtain data on the cheapest available flight from the US (using JFK as the reference point for departures). Moreover, we used Budgetyourtrip to obtain the average amount required to spend a week-long couple\u2019s vacation in each country. Accumulating these data points allowed us to calculate the total expected amount required on a trip to each country. Each country was ranked in ascending order with respect to this metric, and the top 15 countries were selected as the cheapest European countries to visit in 2024.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Czech Republic\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $741\n\nAverage expense during stay: $1548\n\nTotal cost: $2289\n\nWhilst the capital city of Prague is famous for its State Opera theater and other orchestras, the rest of the country sees far and few tourists.

        "title": "20 States With the Most Beautiful Flags According to Reddit",
        "content": "In this article, we will list 20 states with the most beautiful flags according to Reddit. If you want to skip our discussion about Minnesota's new flag, the importance of flags for tourism, and international and domestic tourism in the United States, go to 5\u00a0States With the Most Beautiful Flags According to Reddit.\n\nAs we head toward May, Minnesota is set to get a new state flag that features a white eight-pointed north star, echoing its motto of being the north star state. On the left, the new flag will have a dark blue shape resembling Minnesota, and a blue field on the right. The flag was one of the many in consideration during a months-long process. Minnesota's older flag was criticized for its seal, which to many people, depicts a Native American running away from land being cultivated by a White man. This current flag is not a part of our list of the states with the most beautiful flags according to Reddit.\n\nCountries have been known to leverage their flags as strategies to attract tourists and distinguish themselves in the competitive tourism market. Flags are frequently a standout feature in countries' tourism campaigns.\n\nIn the United States, travel and tourism contribute significantly to the economy. According to the International Trade Administration, overseas tourists contributed $233.5 billion to the US economy in 2019. The travel and tourism industry, as a whole, contributed to 2.9% of the overall GDP in the United States by generating $1.9 trillion in economic output. In addition, the expenditure made by international travelers in the United States accounted for 14.5% of the total global expenditure on international travel, making it the country where international travelers spend the most.\n\nAs such, many American companies are also at the forefront of the tourism industry. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s theme parks and hotels are one of the key attractions for tourists. In fact, a recent study by Oxford estimated that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) resulted in a statewide economic impact of $40.3 billion in Florida in 2022. The company created 263,000 direct and indirect jobs resulting in 1 out of every 32 jobs in the state. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also generated $6.6 billion in tax revenue during the same year.\n\nAnother company, headquartered in the United States, that has a significant impact on tourism is Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). The company aims to offer friendly accommodation options and focuses on travelers who want a localized experience. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) employs the term \"living like a local\" to attract people looking for local experiences. In 2022, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) hosts in the United States facilitated over 44 million guest arrivals in regions without hotels.\n\nStory continues\n\nState flags are becoming increasingly important as figures indicate a surge in US domestic travel. A report from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) has shown that US tourism has achieved a record $2.36 trillion in 2023, despite a slow return of international spending in the country. So, it is worth looking at some of the state flags that users on Reddit find beautiful. 15 Best Places to Retire in Texas\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 20 states with the most beautiful flags according to Reddit, we used a thread on Reddit. The thread asked users the following: \"Which US state has the most beautiful flag in your opinion? Which is the most ugly/boring one?\"\n\nFor our list, we used all the comments that were addressed directly to the original post and mentioned their favorite state flag. In case a comment mentioned more than one state flag, we accounted for all the flags unless it did not rank them. If such a comment ranked the flags, we accounted for only the flag in the top position. For each comment that fit our criteria, we noted the state flag along with the upvotes on the comment. We continued the process till we got 78 entries.\n\nWe ranked each flag according to the number of times it appeared in our sampled responses and named it 'frequency'. As a tie-breaker, we used the total number of upvotes.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 25 most underrated cities in Europe to visit in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion about tourism rebound, over-tourism, and the global tourism industry, go to the 10 Most Underrated Cities in Europe to Visit in 2024.\n\nOver-tourism is creating a problem for European locals in many tourist destinations. While Europe is on everyone's travel bucket list, most people opt for similar destinations. For instance, 80% of visits in France are concentrated in 20% of the country.\n\nThis imbalance has made lives difficult for many locals. Landlords in touristy places have started evicting their tenants for short-term rentals, creating a shortage of housing. The Guardian reports that Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), one of the largest short-term rental companies, has seen triple-digit growth in some European cities since 2014. As a result of this, some popular city destinations in Europe host 20 or more visitors for each local. Venice, Italy gets so many visitors that it has more tourist beds than the residents, as reported by Daily Mail.\n\nThe over-tourism dilemma is making traveling to touristy places increasingly costly. Authorities in such places are introducing visitor fees to discourage people from visiting and help with the upkeep. Venice, for example, has introduced an entrance fee for the entire city ranging from \u20ac3 to \u20ac10. Tourist tax rates in Paris have increased by almost three times recently. Spain has introduced fees to visit Plaza de Espa\u00f1a to ensure its safety and upkeep. So, it makes more sense now than ever to visit some of the most underrated cities in Europe.\n\nVisiting citieswhere few people go will also help those who are struggling with the impact of over-tourism. Ecologists in Action reported that nearly 800,000 people or 35% of the population of the Canary Islands are at risk of poverty or social exclusion because of rising housing and living expenses. Residents of the Canary Islands recently called for a hunger strike against over-tourism. Activists are also putting up false warning signs at beaches across Mallorca to deter English-speaking tourists. It is worth noting that the Canary Islands are located in Africa but they are a Spanish-autonomous community and are considered European from a political and socio-cultural point of view.\n\nThe tourism industry has seen massive growth in the last few decades. An astounding 1.9 billion people took foreign trips in 2019 compared to only 25 million in 1950. The global travel and tourism industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% for the forecast period of 2021 to 2026. At the end of this forecast period, it is expected to be worth $8.9 trillion. It also has a significant footprint in the world economy, as according to the World Tourism and Travel Council, it contributed to 7.6% of the global GDP.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile European countries serve as a hotspot for tourism, the United States is the country where international travelers spend the most.\n\nAmerican companies, as a result, are at the forefront of the tourism industry. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the largest short-term rental companies in the world. In 2022, hosts using the Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) platform in the United States facilitated over 44 million guest arrivals in regions without hotels.\n\nOne of the key attractions for tourists across the world is Disney theme parks owned by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). The company is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate with a significant economic footprint in several states across the United States. A recent study by Oxford estimated that the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was the source of 263,000 direct and indirect jobs in Florida in 2022. It also generated $6.6 billion in tax revenue during the same year. Overall, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) had an economic impact of $40.3 billion in Florida in 2022.\n\nCircling back to tourism in Europe, it is rebounding from the downturn during the pandemic. For the January to September period in 2023, international tourist arrivals in Europe were only 3.2% below 2019 levels. According to the European Travel Commission, the rebound is driven by intra-European travel and the influx of US tourists benefitting from favorable exchange rates. However, the European Travel Commission reports that the recovery remains uneven with 65% of reporting destinations still having pre-pandemic levels of foreign arrivals.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 25 most underrated cities in Europe to visit in 2024. 25 Most Underrated Cities in Europe to Visit in 2024\n\nPhoto by Jacek Dylag on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nSince 'underrated' is a subjective concept, we relied on a consensus method of frequent travelers to curate our list of the 25 most underrated cities in Europe to visit in 2024. We used a popular thread on Reddit to come up with these 25 cities. The thread asked people to mention the most underrated destinations in Europe. We noted down each city till we got 100 entries.\n\nFor each comment that we considered, we also noted the upvotes. If a comment mentioned more than one city, we awarded the number of upvotes to all the cities mentioned. For our list, we considered all the comments that were a direct reply to the thread.\n\nHere is how we calculated our Insider monkey score: number of times the city appears on sampled responses + (total number of upvotes divided by 100). The higher this Insider Monkey Score, the higher the country ranks on our list. As a tiebreaker, we used our list of the countries with the most beautiful nature in Europe and\u00a0gave preference to the city belonging to\u00a0the country ranking higher on this list.\u00a0For example, if city A and city B have the same Insider Monkey Score but the country of city B ranks higher than city A's country on our most beautiful nature in Europe's list, we ranked city B higher.\n\nIt is important to note that even with a tie-breaking system, some cities were tied, which is why we have 14 ranks in our list. If two destinations have the same rank, they are equally underrated regardless of their position on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "20 Countries That Have The Potential To Be Major Tourist Destinations",
        "content": "In this article, we shall discuss the 20 countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations. To skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry in 2024, go directly and\u00a0 see 10 Countries That Have The Potential To Be Major Tourist Destinations.\n\nGlobal Tourism Industry Outlook: Key Trends\n\nAccording to World Tourism Barometer by the WTO, international tourism ended 2023 by reaching 88% of pre-pandemic levels, with more than 1.3 billion people engaging in outbound travel. The release of remaining pent-up demand, enhanced air and rail connectivity, and a robust recovery of Asian markets and countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations is expected to catalyze a complete recovery by the end of 2024. According to a report by Deloitte, there are five major trends which are expected influence the travel industry in 2024, one of them being the meteoric rise of automated bookings. Although automated bookings are hardly a new phenomenon in travel, they are expected to skyrocket in 2024 and beyond, with the online booking market expected to reach $833 billion by the end of 2025 from $432 billion at the end of 2022. Closely related to this trend is an increased use of mobile phones, with the report citing that more than 70% of the global consumer base uses smartphones to make travel reservations. Furthermore, more than 72% of bookings take place within 48 hours of the first Google search. Thus, major players in the travel industry like Booking Holdings Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:EXPE) are divesting greater investments in targeted advertisements to effectively engage with the consumer's attention. Furthermore, these companies realize the short window they have to efficiently retarget customers with appropriate display ads based on prior activity and engagement.\n\nThirdly, corporate travel is looking at a strong resurgence in 2024 and is expected to reach more than 95% of pre-pandemic levels by the second half of 2024, although gains are decelerating. With macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds disrupting operations in countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations, business leaders are relatively much more stringent with travel spending in 2024. Although they recognize the significance of trips in fostering client relationships and facilitating cross-vertical collaboration, costs still emerge as a significant concern. More than 86% of corporate travel managers cite airfare as one of the biggest factors affecting companies' lack of willingness to travel. Despite this, US corporate travel spending is still expected to cross pre-COVID levels by the end of 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to McKinsey, more than 71% of consumers expect travel companies to offer personalized solutions and interactions, with more than 76% of consumers reporting frustration when this demand is not met. Thus, in a bid to win over the market, companies are ensuring that their interactions with consumers are tailored to their unique needs and preferences. Furthermore, it is also essential that advertisements target consumers' prior interactions, making consumer data invaluable for companies. Lastly, skyrocketing interest rates and elevated costs in countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations have made it incredibly expensive to upgrade hotel and airline experiences. In a bid to navigate macroeconomic headwinds, companies are making continued investments in back-office technology and generative AI which may enhance operational efficiency and better align resources to demand.\n\nAs companies continue to capitalize on these trends, investor sentiment around major travel stocks continues to rise. One way to gauge increasing investor interest in the travel industry is by evaluating the performance of prominent travel-focused ETFs like Amplify Travel Tech ETF (NYSE:AWAY), which gives investors direct access to technology-focused equities within the global tourism industry. The ETF seeks investment results which mirror total return performance of the Prime Travel Technology Index NTR, and as of April 25, has more than 31 holdings including major players like Booking Holdings Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:EXPE). In the last one year, the fund is up by more than 19.12% as of April 25. Another major travel-focused ETF is the Harvest Travel & Leisure Index ETF (TSE:TRVL), which provides investors with exposure to the growth trends in the travel industry driven by structural, demographic forces in countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations. With more than 30 equities under management including prominent players like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Marriot International Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:MAR), and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (\n\nNYSE:HLT), the fund is up more than 6.93% year-to-date as of April 25.\n\nTravel in the Metaverse: An Analysis\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, the global travel industry is incredibly well-positioned for a virtual disruption. As the metaverse - a collective space wherein physical and virtual dimensions converge to generate a more immersive, interactive experience - becomes cheaper and faster to implement, if driven by proactive advertising and virtual events, could provide for a $20 billion opportunity by 2030, even in countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations. As innovative formats become more common, new economic models are coming to the foreground. The travel experience of the future is expected to neither be completely online nor be a solely physical experience. Instead, companies across the world like Booking Holdings Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:EXPE) are gearing for a more hybrid orientation, with virtual events, edutainment, and inspiration carefully balanced and integrated with physical destinations. One major way in which companies are dealing with this complexity is by implementing a traveler-first mentality. By empathizing with their target tourist, companies are able to better identify opportunities to integrate relevant virtual aspects.\n\nDuring the pandemic, there was substantial global gravitation towards virtual concerts with significant surges in consumer demand, spending, and audience numbers. In 2020, the metaverse made up for a mere 0.1% of all live-music spending; by 2021, this figure has multiplied by ten-fold. According to the report, virtual events could make up for more than 20% of revenues by the end of the decade, owing largely to increased audience capacity at a fraction of the cost. With the metaverse expected to revolutionize multiple aspects of the global economy especially with regards to countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations, travel is no exception, with virtual events promising enormous potential for the industry as a whole. However, in the short-term, opportunities may be fairly limited for a select key touchpoints, namely travel inspiration, events, and edutainment. End-to-end travel experiences are still further down the road. Countries That Have The Potential To Be Major Tourist Destinations\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the  20 countries that have the potential to be major tourist destinations, we decided to create Insider Monkey's Tourism Potential Index by considering a conference paper from the 28th\u00a0World Business Congress at the University of Cyprus. The paper used the Delphi technique to run a predictive analysis of future tourism and hospitality scenarios in different states. The paper identified three primary metrics through which the tourism potential of a particular country can be gauged, namely infrastructure and development, cultural heritage and attractiveness, and security. We decided to integrate this study with another research by Bloom Consulting, which measures the nation brands of countries in order to predict the international perceptions and reputation countries may have over a specific time period. Hence, to create Insider Monkey's own tourism potential index, we decided to consider four primary metrics, namely infrastructure and development (25 points), cultural heritage and attractiveness (25 points), security (25 points), and international perception and reputation (25 points).\n\nFirstly, we decided to use the index in our article on the 40 Least Visited Countries in the World in order to shortlist 100 countries with low tourism numbers. In order to determine the tourism infrastructure in each country, we decided to use the index in our articles 30 Most Walkable Cities in the World and Top 20 Countries with the Best Roads in the World. In order to determine cultural heritage, we decided to use our article on the 35 Best Destinations in the World for Cultural Tourism. To determine security, we looked at the index in our article 30 Safest Countries in the World in 2024. Finally, in order to determine international perception and reputation, we decided to use Bloom Consulting's predictive analysis of nation brand value in the coming years.\n\nWe created primary rankings for each metric by listing the top 50 countries in each of the four areas, namely infrastructure and development, cultural heritage and attractiveness, security, and international perception and reputation. As expected, there was significant overlap amongst all four primary lists. Then, we assigned points to each country based on their relative position in each primary list. For instance, if a country ranked number 1 on a list, it received 25 points. If it ranked second, it received 24.5 points, and so on. We then tabulated the total number of points scored by each country out of 100 to arrive at a cumulative score for each entry. We then ranked each entry based on these cumulative scores, from lowest to highest.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20 Countries That Have The Potential To Be Major Tourist Destinations\n\n20.

        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nHow Fast Is Airbnb Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nOver the last three years, Airbnb has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, Airbnb's EPS shot from US$2.97 to US$7.54, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 154%.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While Airbnb did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Airbnb's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Airbnb Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$104b company like Airbnb. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$30b. This totals to 29% of shares in the company. Enough to lead management's decision making process down a path that brings the most benefit to shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Airbnb, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$14m.\n\nThe CEO of Airbnb only received US$295k in total compensation for the year ending December 2023. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.\n\nDoes Airbnb Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nAirbnb's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Airbnb is worth considering carefully. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Airbnb by focusing on just these factors, oryou could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "This article looks at big budget film locations to visit in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of experiential travel and set jetting, you may skip ahead to 5 Big Budget Film Locations to Visit in the World.\n\nHaving withstood the challenges of COVID-19, the global tourism industry has now finally rejuvenated revenues and volumes back to pre-pandemic levels. UNWTO has predicted that 2024 will be the year in which tourism will surpass 2019 levels by 2%. However, traveling in 2024 isn\u2019t just about visiting a relative or blowing off steam to recharge yourself for another grueling year in the bullpen. According to Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW), tourists in 2024 are looking to ditch traditional travel itineraries in favor of personalized trips that deliver unique experiences, in a phenomenon referred to as experiential travel.\n\nExperiential Travel\n\nFlywire Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ: FLYW) survey of travel providers in Australia, Italy, Japan, and South Africa shows that 89% of providers surveyed have seen increased demand for experiential travel. Tourists are inclined towards experiential travel due to its propensity for providing meaningful travel experiences.\n\n\u201cOur research into travel providers around the world shows that as we head into 2024, consumers are likely to continue to prioritize investing in unique experiences\u2026 As travelers eschew traditional \u2018off the shelf\u2019 packages, providers are offering experiences that match travelers\u2019 expectations for immersive, personalized trips.\u201d\n\n-Colin Smyth, VP and GM of Travel, Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW).\n\nIn the effort to provide meaningful travel experiences, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) and Duolingo, Inc. (NASDAQ: DUOL) recently teamed up to launch a campaign based on trends noted in India. Per Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) data, there has been a significant increase in travel interest from India\u2019s Gen Z and Millennials towards destinations in Japan and Korea, with a 75% growth in searches for stays in Korea and 300% growth for Japan. These searches have a strong correlation with data collected by Duolingo, Inc. (NASDAQ: DUOL) showing that Japanese and Korean are emerging as some of the most popular languages learnt by Indian users. In response to these observations, the companies are collaborating to merge Duolingo\u2019s language learning expertise with Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) locally hosted stays.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to partner with Airbnb to bring an opportunity that blends learning and traveling in such a seamless manner, providing people with all the right tools to allow them to have an authentic experience and overcome language barriers during travel with ease.\u201d\n\n-George Audi, Global head of Business Development & Partnerships, Duolingo, Inc. (NASDAQ: DUOL).\n\nStory continues\n\nSet Jetting\n\nIncreased interest in traveling to Japan and Korea isn\u2019t a coincidence. It is fueled by trends such as destination dupes, sustainable tourism, and set jetting. Our articles on most underrated travel destinations in Asia and spectacular floating hotels around the world highlight how influential trends such as destination dupes and sustainable tourism are in driving tourism.\n\nIn addition to these trends, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) revealed in its \u201cUnpack 24\u201d report that set jetting, or planning trips inspired by TV shows and movies, is one of the top travel trends in 2024. According to Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE), more than half of travelers surveyed said they\u2019ve researched or booked a trip to a destination after seeing it on a TV show or in a movie. Inspired by Squid Game, a production of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), South Korea was one of the top set-jetting destinations in the world, per Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE).\n\nWhile set jetting may seem like a typical millennial excursion, its roots seep back all the way to the days of Michael Curtiz\u2019s Casablanca (1942), even though the movie was shot entirely in California. Similarly, films like Sony Group Corporation\u2019s (NYSE: SONY) Bullet Train (2019) are just one example in a long list of iconic big budget films, dating back to Godzilla (1954), which have inspired tourists to journey to the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nLately, however, the passion for traveling to iconic film locations has been reinvigorated. Filming locations today range from production centers in LA to the dunes of Wadi Rum in Jordan, with governments across the world also realizing the potential in films to draw tourist dollars. According to a study by France's National Center of Cinematography, four out of five foreign tourists to Paris got an urge to visit after seeing a movie or TV series filmed in the city. 49% of tourists who visited specifically because of a film or TV show revealed it was either due to Emily in Paris or Lupin, both of which are shows produced by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). In 2023, a travel startup named Dharma launched a tour inspired by Netflix, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ: NFLX) Emily in Paris, offering a chance for avid fans to immerse themselves within the shoes of Emily Cooper.\n\nThus, if you\u2019re looking to enrich your vacation with a trip to one of the most famous movie locations in the world, join us as we look at big budget film locations to visit in the world. 25 Big Budget Film Locations to Visit in the World\n\n25 Big Budget Film Locations to Visit in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of big budget film locations to visit in the world, we began by combing through similar lists on the web. We compiled over 15 notable sources such as Travel & Leisure and Enjoy Travel, to develop a preliminary list of big budget film locations to visit in the world. Using these lists, we also developed a scorecard with 2 metrics.\n\nThe first metric was the frequency of destinations in our sources. The second metric was a ranking factor based on the average position of the destinations in their lists. This was calculated by first dividing the position of a destination in each list by the total number of destinations in the list. For lists that did not rank destinations, an average score of 0.5 was used. Our ranking factor was calculated as the average of these scores (across all sources) for a particular destination. By accumulating the frequency and ranking factors, we calculated our Insider Monkey scores. Once sorted in descending order, the first 20 destinations were selected as the big budget film locations to visit in the world.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are 25 Big Budget Film Locations to Visit in the World.\n\n25.

        "title": "Elon Musk insists Tesla isn\u2019t a car company as sales falter",
        "content": "If you don't like what's being said, change the conversation. That's advice Mad Men's Don Draper once gave. And it appears Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is taking it.\n\nBy the numbers, Tesla painted a dismal picture through its latest quarterly results. But the stock told a different story: excitement. New models are on the way, Musk said. And beyond that, Tesla will prosper as a pioneer in autonomous ridesharing. Shares jumped following the earnings release, and the momentum carried over into morning trading Wednesday as the stock surged as much as 14%.\n\nAs Tesla car sales faltered, Musk delivered an optimistic pivot: Tesla isn't a car company.\n\nSales fell 9% from a year ago in the most recent quarter, the first drop in four years. Operating profit tumbled more than 50% from the same period last year. Guidance, too, was a drag, as executives foresee \"notably lower volume.\"\n\nBut the market loved Tesla reassuring the world that, actually, cheaper cars are coming. As Jefferies analysts said in a note after the report, \"first impression for us is CEO Musk appeasing the market by accelerating new product launches.\"\n\nAnd Musk on the earnings call emphasized over and over again that investors shouldn't view Tesla as an automaker but rather as a digital platform akin to Uber (UBER) and Airbnb (ABNB) for an autonomous fleet.\n\nDuring the call, when VP of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy dodged a question about the specific timeline for a mass market $25,000 vehicle, Musk interjected to say that more details will come at Tesla's August 8 robotaxi unveiling. But he added his patented visionary flourish: \u201cThe way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy, and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet.\u201d\n\nBut there's a tension in Musk's auspicious goal-setting. Call it market dissonance. Musk is enthusiastically trying to convince shareholders that Tesla can leapfrog dedicated autonomous car companies like Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo and swiftly \u201csolve autonomy,\u201d even as the market flashes strong signals that investors want Tesla to deliver cheaper EV\u2019s. \"If somebody doesn't believe that Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\" CEO Elon Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday, (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAs Citi analysts wrote in a note after earnings, \"We like Tesla's product pivot that appears to prioritize speed and launch/redesign on existing capacity.\"\n\nBut in his shift of focus, Musk is de-emphasizing the thing people are clamoring for, moving on to Tesla's next big thing, and shifting the valuation goalposts and ultimate vision for the company.\n\nMusk elaborated later on the call: \u201cWe should be thought of as an AI robotics company. If you value Tesla as just an auto company \u2014 it\u2019s just the wrong framework. If you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHe went on to encourage the autonomous non-believers to get lost.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't believe that Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company. And we will. And we are.\"\n\nEven as Tesla's quarter jolted the stock, market observers expressed some skepticism over the company's ambitious plans. \"Commitment to robotaxi is unwavering, still without providing clarity on timeframe and business model,\" the Jefferies note said.\n\nA note from UBS analysts referring to Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, or FSD, was even more critical. \"We don\u2019t doubt that FSD is making progress, but TSLA has talked up autonomy before, and we are skeptical that TSLA will have a 'cyber-cab' or ride-hailing service this decade,\" analysts at UBS wrote after earnings.\n\nMusk sees the day Tesla switches on unsupervised full self-driving as possibly \u201cthe biggest asset value appreciation in history.\u201d That day might be farther than Musk hopes, and it may never arrive. But saying so is its own kind of value appreciation.\n\nIf your company isn't making enough money from the products it sells, it can be helpful to change the idea of what success looks like.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Tesla, Airbnb upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Tesla, Airbnb upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBofA upgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $220 after the company reported what the firm says were better-than-expected Q1 results. Mizuho upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $200, up from $150. The potential launch of sponsored listings is expected to generate double-digit EBITDA upside over the long-term, the firm tells investors in a research note. Wells Fargo upgraded Neurocrine (NBIX) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $170, up from $140. The firm thinks the company's pipeline is \"turning a corner.\" Keefe Bruyette upgraded Globe Life (GL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $110, down from $130. The stock is down 40% over the past six weeks from a Department of Justice subpoena over agent sales practices and a short report alleging wider spread fraud, and while the firm acknowledges ongoing risk from these accusations, it feels better following Globe Life's response on the Q2 earnings call that included a willingness to accelerate and possibly increase buybacks. B. Riley upgraded Children's Place(PLCE) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $7, down from $12. The firm says that if the company can achieve Riley's \"muted\" 2024 and 2025 estimates, there is a chance the company's \"odd and unlikely set of circumstances may yield a positive outcome for shareholders in time.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Molson Coors(TAP) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $56, down from $66The firm says that while Molson has sounded bullish on Q1 trends and spring shelf space resets, it believes cycling a record sales and profit year \"could be extremely difficult.\" Oppenheimer downgraded MSCI (MSCI) to Perform from Outperform. The firm's downgrade is predicated upon increased risk of downward earnings revision. Benchmark downgraded Hibbett (HIBB) to Hold from Buy after JD Sports Fashion announced an agreement to acquire the company for $87.50 per share in cash. BTIG downgraded HashiCorp (HCP) to Neutral from Buy without a price target. The firm sees a balanced risk/reward after the stock's recent run following takeover speculation. Piper Sandler downgraded Independent Bank (IBTX) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $38, down from $48. The firm believes Independent Bank \"looks poised to underperform peers\" from an overall profitability perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBofA initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with a Neutral rating and $150 price target. While the firm views shares as \"an attractive multi-year self-help story,\" it does not have conviction on near-term positive catalysts. BofA resumed coverage of Altice USA(ATUS) with an Underperform rating and $1.50 price target. The firm believes that Altice USA \"remains fundamentally challenged\" and does not believe a sale to Charter (CHTR) is likely in the near term. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Kura Sushi (KRUS) with a Neutral rating and $114 price target. The firm is \"very impressed\" by the company but says Kura's risk/reward is relatively balanced at current levels with the stock's valuation already reflective of a sizable premium to its full-service industry peer set, at least using conventional metrics. KeyBanc initiated coverage of Supermicro (SMCI) with a Sector Weight rating and no price target. The shares are currently trading relatively in line with Supermicro's infrastructure peer group, the firm tells investors in a research note. Wells Fargo resumed coverage of APA Corp.(APA) with an Overweight rating and $55 price target. The firm says long-duration option value for Suriname and global oil production support bullish rating.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "RPT-Need a hotel in the US for Graduation Day? Good luck",
        "content": "(Repeats with revised headline)\n\nBy Chris Taylor\n\nNEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - If you think getting tickets to a Taylor Swift concert or the World Series is tough, try booking a hotel room in an American college town for Graduation Day.\n\nToni Milbourne faced this before her daughter's graduation from West Virginia University in May. Hotel room rates in Morgantown doubled before the local event. In a nearby town, prices more than tripled to $350 a night.\n\n\"It absolutely feels like price gouging,\" said Milbourne, managing editor for a West Virginia newspaper. \"People need to be aware that companies are taking advantage of people in times that should be a celebration.\"\n\nParents of college kids frequently suck it up, and not just around Graduation Day.\n\nWhether for Family Weekends or Homecomings, smaller communities often get swarmed by visitors far beyond their ability to handle them. Meanwhile, pricing algorithms for airlines and hotels do what they were designed to do - crank up prices when demand soars.\n\n\"A lot of smaller college towns might have 20,000 or 30,000 people, and maybe 2,000 hotel rooms,\" said Professor Chris Anderson, who researches pricing, at Cornell University's Nolan School of Hotel Administration.\n\n\"With crazy high-demand dates, like a college graduation, all of a sudden you have 40,000 parents and guests arriving for multiple days of festivities. Now you have a real imbalance of supply and demand.\"\n\nAs a result, parents must pay super-high prices for hotels and flights, if they are available at all.\n\nTo avoid this quandary, Shama Diegnan, a digital marketer from South Orange, New Jersey, sprung into action for Parents Weekend at a Midwestern college even before her younger son had accepted the school's offer.\n\n\"It never occurred to me that these hotels may cost more than in a major metropolitan city,\" said Diegnan. She was stunned that one local hotel charged over $1,000 a night, up from its usual room rate of about $100.\n\nHow can parents avoid Graduation Day nightmares? Here are a few tips.\n\nPREPARE EARLY\n\nMany hotels typically take reservations a year in advance. If your child is slated to graduate next year, start booking now. As for Parents Weekends in the fall, you should have already booked. If those dates are still not set, check the university parents' Facebook group for updates.\n\nNote that for such high-demand dates, hotels may be stricter than usual, and may require prepayment for nonrefundable bookings or set a minimum number of nights, Anderson said.\n\nStory continues\n\nCHECK OUT ALTERNATIVES\n\nHotels have a fixed number of rooms, but homeowners on Airbnb or VRBO may offer extra rooms, apartments or houses on high-demand dates.\n\nFor Parents Weekend, Diegnan booked a $300-a-night Airbnb 10 minutes from campus, instead of a local hotel room at $500 or more.\n\nOne caveat from Anderson: Some parts of the country, like New York City, are stricter about short-term rentals, limiting homeowners' ability to absorb huge influxes of visitors.\n\nLOOK FOR SECONDARY MARKETS\n\nParents wishing to cancel nonrefundable hotel rooms are in a tight spot. That is why options like www.gohoken.com have sprung up.\n\n\"They specialize in having hotel rooms for high-demand dates, and allowing people to offload prepaid rooms that they don't need anymore,\" Anderson said. \"It's like a StubHub secondary market, but for hotel rooms.\"\n\nMilbourne gave up on local hotels and plans to bunk at the home of family members instead.\n\n\"I don't think hotels should be able to jack up prices in moments like this,\" she said. \"Not only is my daughter graduating, but she spent four years on active duty in the Army. This is a big deal for us.\" (Editing by Lauren Young and Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned -6.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb belongs, has lost 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Airbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share, indicating a change of +61.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.63 points to a change of -36.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 indicates a change of +16.7% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Airbnb is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.08 billion and $12.39 billion estimates indicate +11.7% and +11.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.6%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.57%. The EPS surprise was +13.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we shall discuss the 40 best places to visit in India before you die. To skip our detailed analysis of the tourism industry in India in 2024, go directly and see 10 Best Places to Visit in India Before You Die.\n\nAccording to figures by the \u00a0World Travel & Tourism Council, India is currently the tenth largest country in the world in terms of the travel and tourism industry's total contribution to the country's GDP, which currently stands north of $191.3 billion as of 2023. Moreover, the country's tourism sector is a critical source of foreign exchange, with India offering more than 40 UNESCO world heritage sites, 10 bio-geographic zones, 105 national parks, and 560 wildlife sanctuaries, many of which rank amongst some of the best places to visit in India before you die. India's travel agency business is severely dominated by MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises), with more than 300,000 travel agent businesses facilitating seamless travel to some of the best places to visit in India, thereby representing the largest volumes of business in booking at about more than 52% of the travel market. These are heavily segmented across multiple diverse categories of service providers, like travel packages, cab, and bus booking companies. This segment is expected to reach more than $65 billion by 2027. The country's international tourist arrivals are expected to reach more than 30.5 million by 2028. These are increasingly optimistic figures, especially considering the fact that India was one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic as virtually all public movement in the country was restricted.\n\nZooming In On India's Economic Boom\n\nOur article on the 35 Most Visited Countries in the World in 2024 projects India to be one of the fastest growing tourist destinations for leisure-travel spendingby 2026, causing stocks like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and MakeMyTrip Ltd. (NASDAQ:MMYT) to divert greater investments in India's bustling tourism market. According to a report by McKinsey, India's economic boom and staggering population growth lands it amongst an elite group of countries which are expected to deliver record international travel in the coming years, with the number of total trips skyrocketing from 13 million in 2022 to more than 80 million in 2040. This is supplemented by the fact that India is now the fifth largest economy in the world and its population, predominantly below the age of 25, has overtaken China to become the largest in the world with over 1.4 billion people.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in the Indian Market Potential\n\nOur article on the 10 Best India ETFs sheds light upon the optimism surrounding India's economic boom which peaked investor interest in many India-focused ETFs like iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (BATS:SMIN), which tracks the investment results of the MSCI India Small Cap Index. The index comprises relatively small Indian companies in terms of market cap, thereby providing targeted access to the small cap segment of the Indian stock market. Over the past five years, the ETF is up 93.01% as of April 20.\u00a0 Introduced on February 8 2012, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (BATS:SMIN) holds net assets worth more than $858 million and a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2% as of April 20. Furthermore, as of April 20, it features a portfolio of 486 holdings with the most prominent ones being Voltas Ltd. (NSE:VOLTAS), Max Financial Services Ltd. (NSE:MSFL), and BSE Ltd. (NSE:BSE). Another ETF attracting positive investor interest is WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSE:EPI), which aims to provide investors with exposure to the broad Indian all cap equity of profitable enterprises with a value centric approach. With an expense ratio of 0.85%, the ETF's total assets are valued at $2.91 million as of April 20. Over the past year, the ETF is up 36.9% as of April 20. Some of the most prominent components in the ETF are Reliance Industries Ltd. (NSE:RELIANCE), ICICI Bank Ltd. (\n\nNYSE:IBN), and Coal India Ltd. (NSE:COALINDIA). As a result of these economic tailwinds, prominent travel stocks like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and MakeMyTrip Ltd. (NASDAQ:MMYT) are hoping to capitalize on India's economic growth wave and its expanding middle class.\n\nIndia's impressive economic gains have also resulted in infrastructural advancement, with enhanced air and road connectivity facilitating global demand for tourism to the best places to visit in India whilst driving sector-wide growth as well. For instance, one primary beneficiary of this advancement is the airline travel market in India, which was valued at $20 billion in 2020 and is projected to double in size by 2027 owing to advancements in airport infrastructure and increased access to passports. Massive demand for travel to the best places to visit in India before you die has led to major Indian airline carriers to place lucrative orders for more than 1100 jets and planes over the last couple of months. For instance, in June 2023, Indigo placed the largest commercial aircraft order in history for more than 500 Airbus A320 aircraft carriers which are to be delivered by 2030 to 2035. This development came in addition to Air India's massive deal to acquire more than 450 planes from Airbus and Boeing in the same month. According to Booking Holdings' (NASDAQ:BKNG) report 'How India Travels 2023', Indians are becoming increasingly inclined to shift away from conventional hotel settings to accommodations like apartments, villas, homestays, and other unique alternatives, leading to enormous upsides for companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB).\n\nEco-tourism in India: An Overview\n\nAccording to a report by KPMG, tailwinds from India's rampant tourism growth are expected to rub off on the country's growing services industry thereby facilitating long-term development. However, the report predicts that despite such an optimistic outlook, major companies operating within India's bustling tourism industry like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and MakeMyTrip Ltd. (NASDAQ:MMYT) are under increasing pressure to adopt more climate-friendly alternatives owing to mounting concerns about climate change and the overall need for India to disassociate its impressive economic surge from greenhouse gas emissions. This is owing to the fact that despite having a relatively low per capita consumption rate when compared to some of the larger economies in the G20, India is projected to have one of the largest carbon footprints in the world in the next decade.\n\nWith an increase in travel and tourism in the country to some of the best places to visit in India before you die, India's per capita emissions are on the rise. As per the KPMG report, the industry is well-positioned to to generate revenues upwards of $59 billion by 2028. Moreover, India's sustainable tourism market was valued at more than $26.01 million in 2023 and is expected to reach $151.9 million by 2032 at a staggering CAGR of 19.3%. This meteoric rise sheds light upon the increasing pressure on the country's tourism industry to adopt responsible climate practices, with hotels and resorts resorting to solar, wind and geothermal energy sources in a bid to contain their carbon footprint. Eco-tourism is a critical segment of the global tourism industry and is expected to amount to more than $4.55 billion by 2027. For the fiscal year 2025, the government decided to allocate more than $29.3 million to develop sustainable tourism infrastructure, and promote adventure and religious tourism to some of the best places to visit in India before you die. According to India's G20 Sherpa and former CEO of NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant:\n\n\"We add a huge [carbon] footprint as we travel. India will attract 40-45 million tourists in the coming years and we should focus on enhancing the value per tourist rather than [the raw numbers]. By doing this we will be able to attract more companies and greater investment from around the world.\" Best Places to Visit in India Before You Die\n\nPhoto by Sylwia Bartyzel on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to determine the 40 best places to visit in India before you die, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources, including but not limited to travel blogs, news reports, and Reddit threads (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). We then shortlisted more than 70 places which appeared most frequently during our research. Since determining the quality of a travel destination is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria based on some of the most oft-cited priorities for tourists when picking a travel destination; the criteria is premised on each place's cultural or historical significance (25 points), natural or architectural beauty (20 points), and popularity amongst tourists (15 points). We then proceeded to award each place a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 40 places which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the cultural significance and natural or architectural beauty of the place.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "While revenge travel may be a fading concept, consumers still value accruing their vacation hours, potentially boding well for certain travel stocks to buy now.\n\nAccording to a Deloitte report, we may be moving into a new era of travel prioritization. Per Hotel Dive\u2019s summary of the analysis, \u201cThe report found that travelers are most likely to splurge on in-destination experiences, lodging location and destination distance.\u201d So, the desire to explore hasn\u2019t diminished. Rather, certain preferences may have shifted.\n\nPlus, expenditure data shows that people are still opening their wallets. That being the case, it\u2019s a great time to consider travel stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHilton (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest brands in the lodging industry, Hilton (NYSE:HLT) engages in managing, franchising, owning and leasing hotels and resorts. It operates through two segments: Management and Franchise, along with Ownership. Fundamentally, HLT stock faces stiff competition from the sharing economy, namely Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Nevertheless, Airbnb may be losing its luster.\n\nIncreasingly, I\u2019ve been reading up on some horror stories about the company and its users\u2019 experiences. Granted, this is not the majority experience. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the company has a hold consensus among analysts. Also, its average price target of $147.07 implies an 8% downside risk.\n\nOn the other hand, experts rate HLT stock a consensus moderate buy with a $213.91 price target. That implies about 8% upside potential. However, the high-side estimate calls for a price per share of $254.\n\nAnalysts are also looking at revenue to reach $11.24 billion, up 9.8% from last year\u2019s haul of $10.23 billion. Overall, it could be an intriguing idea for travel stocks to buy now.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) a close-up shot of an airplane engine\n\nSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the top-tier names in the airline industry, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) could be a huge beneficiary if travel sentiment truly picks up. What\u2019s intriguing about UAL stock is that the share price is heavily discounted relative to its pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, if the aforementioned prioritization occurs, United could enjoy a significant upside pathway.\n\nOne aspect to consider is the company\u2019s strong financial performance. In the trailing four quarters, the average surprise came out to 31.45%. Further, UAL recently popped higher on the underlying company\u2019s strong earnings forecast. Even with the boost, analysts\u2019 average price target of $58.27 implies upside potential of over 13%. Further, the high-side target reaches an ambitious $75.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate revenue of $57.39 billion. That\u2019s up 6.8% from last year\u2019s print of $53.72 billion. Also, the most optimistic target calls for sales of $58.33 billion. In the following year, the top line could rise to $60.27 billion. Thus, it makes a reasonable case for travel stocks to buy now.\n\nUber (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the company that launched the ride-sharing concept (and the concept of the sharing economy), Uber (NYSE:UBER) is a powerhouse among travel stocks to buy now. What makes it compelling is that it\u2019s attacking the broader value chain. Yes, the core business will center on ride sharing. However, it\u2019s making big inroads into food deliveries and even shipping.\n\nRegarding the ride-sharing unit, Uber presents two main avenues for growth. First, the service caters to everyday mobility needs. Second, when going abroad to places where English isn\u2019t the main language, the underlying app is a lifesaver. Basically, the traveler and the driver conduct business via the app, not with each other. So, there are less likely to be problems (i.e. scams).\n\nNotably, analysts are quite bullish on UBER stock, forecasting EPS of $1.28 for the current fiscal year. That\u2019s up from last year\u2019s result of 82 cents. On the top line, they\u2019re projecting sales of $40.79 billion or a growth rate of 16.2%. The next year, revenue could fly to $47.47 billion. For speculators, UBER is one of the travel stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Have Airbnb Guest Favorites Overshadowed the Superhost Program?",
        "content": "A living room of a short-term rental in Lisbon, Portugal. Source: Airbnb.\n\nAchieving Airbnb superhost status usually means more money in your pocket, and it comes with several perks. But some hosts are critical about the program\u2019s current status on Airbnb.\n\nThe main complaint: That Guest Favorites have overshadowed superhosts. Guest Favorites highlight properties most liked and booked by guests and superhost status highlights hosts who go above and beyond to provide excellent hospitality. A superhost badge helps profiles stand out, and guests can sometimes use a filter to find them.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the superhost filter itself was very prominently listed,\u201d said Matthew Orley, the CEO of Red Cottage, based in New York City. \u201cIn the update that they did in January, Airbnb removed that. And it was not really spoken to. But it was very clear that the new filters that are prominent at the top are Guest Favorites. So now you\u2019re searching for the Guest Favorite, which is much more of a focus on the individual property, as opposed to the host itself.\u201d\n\nAirbnb said there are more than 1 million superhosts, or about 20% of all hosts around the world.\n\nAn Airbnb spokesperson told Skift, \u201cWe\u2019ve simplified some of our search filters and added a new Guest Favorites filter to help guests find some of the most-loved homes on the platform. Guests will still be able to see whether their host is a superhost on the listing page. Today, nearly two-thirds of Guest Favorites come from superhosts.\u201d\n\nSuperhost Qualifications and Requirements\n\nThis is how it works: In order to qualify as a superhost, the owner of the listing must have an account and have fulfilled the following requirements:\n\nCompleted a minimum of 10 trips or 3 reservations totaling at least 100 nights. Maintained a response rate of 90% or higher. Kept cancellations to fewer than 1%, with allowances for cases covered by Airbnb\u2019s recently changed Major Disruptive Events Policy. Maintained an overall host rating of 4.8 or higher.\n\nAirbnb reviews a host\u2019s performance quarterly, considering the past 12 months of activity on all listings. Hosts don\u2019t need to have hosted for the entire 12 months to qualify. The assessment periods run for seven days starting on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1.\n\nIf they meet the requirements by the assessment date, they will become a superhost automatically without needing to apply.\n\nSuperhost Benefits\n\nAirbnb superhosts are rewarded well: Airbnb claims it enhances the visibility and appeal of listings, builds trust with potential guests, and can lead to increased bookings and revenue.\n\nSuperhosts earn more too \u2014 an average increase of 22%. Additionally, they receive a 20% bonus on host referrals and an annual travel coupon. They may also qualify for complimentary photography sessions to enhance the appeal of listings. Superhosts also get priority support from Airbnb.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome Hosts Feel The Checklist Is Rigid\n\nAirbnb seems to have given heightened prominence to Guest Favorites, which often appear on multiple listings across the homepage.\n\nAnd some hosts say there are other factors that influence superhost status. These could include: the number of guests a property can host, average occupancy nights (i.e. demand for the rental) and average listing price.\n\nSkift spoke to some hosts who feel like the program can be too rigid, without consideration for special circumstances \u2014 especially when it comes to cancellations.\n\nNicki Hutchman, who runs vacation rental company Competa Escapes in Malaga, Spain, said the superhost program, though beneficial for visibility, is very strict about fulfilling all of the requirements.\n\n\u201cThe Superhost program is based on maintaining a minimum number of nights. You can be excellent at what you do and score very highly, but if you don\u2019t get the minimum number of nights (perhaps like us due to a high percent of direct bookings) you may not make this quota,\u201d Hutchman said. \u201cAlso so many guests now threaten to leave a bad review if you don\u2019t give a discount, early check-in, late check-out that hosts can get a negative review score when actually they have offered a great service and delivered everything they promised. Blackmailing over reviews is a real problem in the industry.\u201d\n\nAirbnb acknowledges that it places a lot of emphasis on cancellations. An Airbnb spokesperson said that cancellations, whether last minute or in advance, can cause holiday anxiety for guests and break the trust they expect when booking a listing on Airbnb.\n\nThe company also has made changes to reduce cancellations. These include adjusting default booking settings and reducing calendar availability to give new hosts greater control and flexibility before their first booking. New pricing tools allow hosts to easily see the price guests pay to prevent inaccurate pricing. Also there are firmer consequences and stricter policies for host cancellations that could have been avoided.\n\n\u201cFollowing these updates, in the final quarter of 2023, Host cancellations were reduced by 36%,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nCan Hosts Opt Into Some Features?\n\nOrley, the Red Cottage CEO, which provides vacation rental management for destinations around New York City, said that while traveling he only seeks to stay with superhosts to avoid properties that are not adequately vetted. But he noticed they\u2019re not top of the search on Airbnb anymore.\n\nOrley also said that features like the host offering instant booking \u2014 where guests can book a place without host approval \u2014 give the property more visibility.\n\n\u201cAll of these mechanisms, through which Airbnb gives a property more visibility \u2014 there are a lot of different things at play,\u201d Orley said. \u201cAnd you as an individual or as a professional host, you\u2019re still considering all of these things in tandem\u2026 We don\u2019t do instant booking because we want more security and we want to vet our guests, that diminishes the standing within the search rankings.\u201d\n\nOrley also said that factors that are not within a hosts\u2019 control can sometimes impact superhost status.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, there are things that raise a listing higher,\u201d Orley said. \u201cWe also know that the recency and the frequency of reviews will push you higher, which is not something that\u2019s necessarily in your hands, it\u2019s just all of these things that helped the algorithm soar.\u201d\n\nHosts like Orley and Hutchman, whose businesses don\u2019t depend on Airbnb because they say they have a lot of direct bookings, feel like the superhost badge is an all-or-nothing proposition. They cannot opt into some features and opt out of others.\n\n\u201cWe know there are other things that we\u2019re opting out of, we\u2019re opting out of instant books. So we\u2019re trying to figure out how we can raise, and improve your performance, while not necessarily even buying into the entire package that Airbnb is selling,\u201d Orley said.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s Challenge\n\nSome hosts understand that managing the superhost program can be a herculean task for Airbnb, especially at the rate supply is increasing. At the end of 2023, Airbnb said it had 7.7 million active listings, compared to 6.6 million at the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a struggle the whole industry has had as more and more listings come on board,\u201d said Wendy Qi, who along with her husband owns and manages eight Airbnb properties. \u201cHow do you differentiate? It\u2019s very hard and I understand Airbnb\u2019s position where it\u2019s the arbiter of who makes a good host and who doesn\u2019t. I have had to cancel reservations because of road closure, which was out of my control, and I think Airbnb allows for one cancellation without penalty.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Qi agrees that overall, the superhost badge is validation for a host that comes with certain benefits.\n\n\u201cThere is still something there for hosts in the superhost program. But when I saw that Airbnb came out with Guest Favorites, that also made sense to me because it\u2019s both hard and easy to earn the superhost badge. Like you could be a superhost but guests may not favor you.\u201d\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its \u201cPolen Global Growth Strategy\u201d first-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the first quarter, the fund increased 8.10% gross and 7.81% net, respectively, trailing the MSCI ACW Index\u2019s 8.20% return. The market dynamics that were in place at the end of last year persisted in many respects during the first quarter. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy featured stocks like Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that connects hosts and guests. On April 18, 2024, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock closed at $160.10 per share. One-month return of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) was -6.67%, and its shares gained 35.65% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has a market capitalization of $99.797 billion.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"During the quarter, we initiated new positions in Sage Group and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and added to our existing position in Globant.\n\nAirbnb is a great business model, according to our research, due to its two-sided global network effects. For several reasons, Airbnb has a better mousetrap with its supply growth engine, with its hosts having a far lower cost of capital and more flexibility than hotels. We think private rentals should continue to grow their share of overall accommodation stays, potentially up to 30% of lodging or higher over the long term, letting the private rental gross booking value grow at a low double-digit rate. We also think Airbnb should continue to gain share within the private rental market as its global network effects strengthen, allowing for mid-teens revenue growth.

        "content": "Good morning. Airbnb\u2019s new finance chief has experience steeped in strategy.\n\nEllie Mertz, who took over as CFO on March 1, joined the short-term rental company in 2013 and has been integral in helping to revolutionize short-term stays. Cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky called her his \"right hand for nearly 11 years\" and said that \u201cunder her leadership, our company grew from adolescence to adulthood, with revenue growing over 100x.\u201d\n\nMertz, who spent seven years at Netflix in a variety of financial planning and analysis (FP&A) roles before joining Airbnb, succeeded Dave Stephenson, who, after becoming CFO in 2019, has been promoted to a newly created role of chief business officer.\n\nWhen Mertz first joined Airbnb in 2013, she was the head of global FP&A before being promoted to VP of finance. This CFO role is her first. At Airbnb, FP&A is now called Strategic Finance, Mertz explained, adding that managing budgets, instilling financial discipline, and creating accurate forecasts\u2014are now just table stakes.\n\n\"The real value comes with understanding our business partners\u2019 functions, delivering them actionable insights into how things are working, the returns that we\u2019re getting, and insights into business trends that allow them to make strategic decisions to positively impact the business,\u201d she explained.\n\nAs finance chief, Mertz leads that strategy. \u201cPart of the CFO's role is to steady the ship, no matter what the waters look like,\u201d Mertz told me. And keeping the balance sheet steady is pivotal to ensure that you can \"fight the next fight,\" she said.\n\nAirbnb, which last year earned its first appearance on the Fortune 500 list, reported $2.22 billion in revenue for Q4 2023, up 17% year over year\u2014and exceeding estimates. Its quarterly adjusted net income of $489 million was the most profitable fourth quarter ever.\n\nAnd those figures didn't include thousands of people traveling for one of the year's biggest events in the U.S.: a total solar eclipse. On April 7, the night before the eclipse, with 25% of Airbnb\u2019s total bookings along the path of totality, 90% had been reserved.\n\n\u201cThe reason that Airbnb is so popular for these types of events,\" Mertz added, \"is that we literally do have listings everywhere you might want to go.\"\n\nBy the end of 2023, Airbnb\u2019s active listings exceeded 7.7 million\u2014up 18% in Q4, year over year\u2014and hosts earned more than a combined $57 billion last year.\n\nAnd Mertz doesn't want to be left out. \u201cI'm in the middle of decorating my guest house to list it,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not fully furnished yet, but I will be a host shortly.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTo read the rest of my full conversation with Mertz, including how her work at Netflix helped her succeed after moving over to Airbnb, please see the complete article here.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nMar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 55%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Airbnb implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 9 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders own 29% of Airbnb\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 55% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Airbnb.\n\nView our latest analysis for Airbnb  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Airbnb?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Airbnb does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Airbnb's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Airbnb. With a 11% stake, CEO Brian Chesky is the largest shareholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.2% by the third-largest shareholder. Interestingly, the second and third-largest shareholders also happen to be the Top Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively. This once again signifies considerable insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders.\n\nWe also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Airbnb\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Airbnb, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$100b, and insiders have US$29b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "How navigating Netflix\u2019s DVD-to-streaming transition helped prepare Airbnb\u2019s new CFO for surviving the pandemic",
        "content": "Taking on the CFO role at a Fortune 500 company requires substantial preparation. And Airbnb\u2019s new finance chief has been battle tested.\n\nEllie Mertz, an 11-year veteran of the short-term rental company, began her tenure as CFO on March 1, succeeding Dave Stephenson, who filled that position beginning in 2019 and was since been promoted to the newly created role of chief business officer.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of things I love about the finance function,\u201d Mertz told Fortune. \u201cOne is being able to have broad visibility over an organization and a familiarity across functions where you can be a thought-partner. Another thing I love is actually telling a story with numbers.\u201d\n\nBefore joining Airbnb, Mertz served as vice president of finance at Netflix. During her seven years at the company, she held several financial planning and analysis (FP&A) leadership roles. When she first joined Airbnb in 2013, she was the head of global FP&A before being promoted to VP of finance. This CFO role is her first. She's also a board member at DoorDash and Faire.\n\nMertz said she's long been drawn to the tech world. \u201cI graduated from undergrad right at the beginning of the first internet bubble,\" she added, \"and somewhat flocked to being part of that technology revolution.\"\n\nAnd she certainly did her part to help Airbnb revolutionize short-term stays. Cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky said she effectively was his \"right hand for nearly 11 years\" and that \u201cunder her leadership, our company grew from adolescence to adulthood, with revenue growing over 100x.\u201d\n\n\u2018Knowing what you can control\u2019\n\nA recent McKinsey report points to five priorities for CFO hopefuls: a unique vision for the role, sponsorship, developing skills in relevant areas, taking professional risks to broaden one's experience, and engaging with the board.\n\nBuilding a portfolio of diversified skills played a big part in preparing Mertz for the CFO role, she said, sharing two specific experiences in her career\u2014one at Netflix, the other at Airbnb\u2014that helped build the stamina necessary for a finance chief.\n\n\u201cThis seems like a very dated example, but I joined Netflix back in the days when we just offered DVDs,\u201d she said. The company in 2011 separated its DVD and streaming offerings, charging customers for each, creating an enormous backlash.\n\n\u201cIt was received very poorly by consumers, and we lost about 70% of market cap in about three months,\u201d Mertz recalled, saying she learned the importance of acting quickly and with purpose, while really getting back to the roots of what a company does well. That experience also set Mertz up to help Airbnb to navigate a world crisis in 2020. \"When the pandemic hit, we lost 80% of our bookings overnight, started hemorrhaging cash, and there was really no end in sight in terms of what might happen,\" she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nA big part of Airbnb staying above water came from being \u201cextremely decisive,\u201d Mertz continued. \u201cI would say we were ahead of the game in terms of making sure we were managing across our stakeholders, and also managing the financials to ensure that we would survive to the end of the pandemic. I think our very successful IPO at the end of 2020 is a testament to how decisively we navigated that crisis.\u201d\n\nThe major lesson, Mertz said, boiled down to \u201cknowing what you can control and taking action versus being paralyzed by uncertainty that surrounds you.\"\n\nPost-pandemic, people were ready to travel. Airbnb earned a spot on the Fortune 500 list in 2023 for the first time. In February, Airbnb reported $2.22 billion in revenue for Q4 2023, up 17% year over year, beating estimates, and with an adjusted net income of $489 million\u2014the firm's most profitable fourth quarter ever.\n\nSteadying the ship\n\nUncertain times that include sticky inflation, geopolitical conflicts, and upcoming presidential elections could actually provide opportunities for innovation for companies with a growth mindset. So what\u2019s Mertz\u2019s perspective?\n\n\u201cPart of the CFO's role is to steady the ship, no matter what the waters look like,\u201d she said. And keeping the balance sheet steady is pivotal to ensure that you can \"fight the next fight,\" she added.\n\nMertz stepped into the CFO role at a moment of transformation for Airbnb. \u201cWe've scaled dramatically,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at our financials, last year, we delivered over $70 billion of booking value, and that virtually came from one product\u2014accommodations.\u201d Looking forward, the company is focusing on ways to leverage its brand, the marketplace, and the guest and host communities, with the goal of delivering more products and services.\n\nOn the guest side, there\u2019s a newer product called Experiences, where you can take a cooking or a painting class, or do a tour, during your stay. For hosts, there\u2019s a cohosting option where a local can offer customized support ranging from cleaning or welcoming guests to full-service property management.\n\n\u201cMy priority is to work closely with Brian, and with David, in his new capacity as a chief business officer, to enable that transformation,\" Mertz said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Avoid According to Wall Street Analysts: April 2024",
        "content": "U.S. stocks sold off on Friday due to a number of reasons, including increased geopolitical tensions, higher-than-expected inflation figures, as well as elevation valuation. If the current macroeconomic environment persists, investors are likely to come up with a list of stocks to avoid in the near term.\n\nMoreover, the earnings season isn\u2019t off to a good start after JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock fell more than 6% after the banking giant released its first-quarter results. CEO Jamie Dimon also cautioned about persistent inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.\n\nRisk assets are likely to stay under pressure amid reports of potential conflict between Israel and Iran, adding to inflation concerns alongside fresh U.S. imports data. Iran\u2019s Saturday attack on Israel spurred a flight to safety trade, strengthening the dollar and causing risk assets to sell off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile markets were closed over the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other digital coins fell sharply after Israel experienced its first direct attack from Iranian territory. Israel said it neutralized 99% of the 300 identified threats aimed at its soil.\n\nThe onslaught of drones and missiles was allegedly retaliatory for a suspected Israeli strike that resulted in the death of senior Iranian officials in Syria. The increased tensions are likely to push risk assets lower, like high-growth tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the top three stocks to avoid in April due to heightened geopolitical risks and market pressures.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a financial services company known for its commission-free trading app. Founded in 2013, it offers users access to stocks, options, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies with no trading fees.\n\nRobinhood stock is likely to stay under pressure near-term due to the challenging geopolitical situation in the Mideast, as well as due to the rating downgrade at Citi Research (NYSE:C). The bank\u2019s equity analysts downgraded Robinhood stock from Neutral to Sell, setting a price target of $16.00 (up from $13.00).\n\nCiti noted HOOD\u2019s strong 2024 start, up 44% year-to-date, largely attributed to rising BTC prices. However, Citi believes valuation has disconnected from fundamentals, posing risks on potential BTC price pullback, slower retail activity, or market downturn, despite improved fundamentals.\n\nRobinhood stock is already trading pressure given the pullback in cryptocurrency prices following the attack on Israel on Saturday. These reasons make HOOD one of the stocks to avoid in April.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge fundamentals have improved in recent periods (healthy trading activity, AUC and deposit growth), which are driving an increase to our forward estimates/PT. But we see risks to the stock here on any material pullback in BTC prices,\u201d Citi analysts said.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) is a provider of cloud networking solutions. Founded in 2004, it specializes in high-performance, scalable, and reliable network platforms for large data center and computing environments.\n\nArista stock tumbled last week after Rosenblatt analysts cut their rating on the company\u2019s shares. More precisely, Rosenblatt double downgraded ANET stock from Buy to Sell with a price target, signaling caution about the stock\u2019s near-term outlook.\n\nRosenblatt expressed concerns about Arista\u2019s potential in AI Data Center networking, suggesting that while Ethernet is promising, Arista may not benefit as much as expected. He believes Arista\u2019s AI opportunity is smaller than perceived, leading to an inflated stock price, a commentary which directly affected ANET stock.\n\n\u201cThe company will likely continue to gain Enterprise share, but this type of business typically does not support super-high operating margins and super-premium EPS multiples,\u201d Rosenblatt analysts said.\n\nMoreover, Arista is a high-growth tech stock that is likely to trade under pressure given the sensitive situation in the Middle East.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Girl holding smartphone with Airbnb app on screen.

ABNB Stock.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities. Despite facing challenges, the company remains a dominant force in the alternative accommodations market.\n\nLast week, Needham & Company downgraded Airbnb stock from Buy to Hold and removed its price target, citing challenges for the company to expand beyond its core. Needham believes the market is overly optimistic about ABNB\u2019s potential to disrupt the global OTA industry with artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWith the stock trading at a premium to peers relative to growth we are moving to the sidelines,\u201d stated Needham & Company analysts.\n\nThis is the third downgrade which ABNB stock faced this year, following such actions at DA Davidson and Phillip Securities.\n\n\u201cWith no positive revenue impact from these new \u201cbeyond-the-core\u201d expansion initiatives likely until CY\u201925 and our expectation of a more normalized growth trajectory for ABNB\u2019s core accommodations business, we expect it may prove difficult for ABNB shares to maintain the magnitude of its valuation premium vs. peers,\u201d DA Davidson analysts wrote.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The tech sector is notorious for both its high growth potential and unpredictable volatility. After a challenging last few years, investors are on the hunt for undervalued tech stocks that present solid fundamentals with potential for outsized returns.\n\nUndervalued tech stocks can provide lucrative opportunities if you can spot them amidst the noise. These companies are often overlooked, unprofitable, or temporarily facing short term headwinds. However, they hold underlying strengths and present strong indicators of being undervalued. While their current market valuations may not reflect their intrinsic worth, astute investors recognize the latent value waiting to be unlocked.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top three undervalued tech stocks to buy like there\u2019s no tomorrow!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has revolutionized the travel industry by providing travelers with unique and often more affordable accommodations. With the travel industry on pace to recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, the stock offers a compelling long term value proposition.\n\nAirbnb offers a vast selection of spaces, from private rooms to entire homes, catering to a diverse range of customer needs. Despite the pandemic\u2019s blow to the travel industry, Airbnb adapted its business model. The company delivered impressive revenue growth in the following years, with record FCF and profits in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal year. However, FY23 was truly a remarkable year for the business. Its hosting community surpassed more than 5 million active users, with active listing exceeding 7.7 million.With the gradual recovery of the travel sector, Airbnb is poised to capitalize on the pent up demand. This makes Airbnb one of the top undervalued tech stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nDoorDash (DASH) Close up of Doordash (DASH) logo and symbol displayed at the entrance to one of their offices\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) is one of the best undervalued tech stocks to buy now. Its user-friendly app and expansive network of restaurants and users has fueled its growth since its founding back in 2013. But the company is taking additional steps to grow sales for its merchants and expand into new verticals.\n\nDoorDash is not a company that you may consider to be undervalued. The company has posted staggering operating losses since its IPO. However, those operating losses have been shrinking over the last several quarters as management sets sights on profitability. While the pandemic was a major boost to its business, DoorDash has maintained its momentum as the economy reopened. According to Statista, DoorDash holds 66% market share of food delivery in the United States. This is astonishing, and the company\u2019s FCF swelled more than 6000% YOY to $1.34 billion in FY23. With further improvements to their unit economics and growing marketplace GOV, the path to profitability is right around the corner.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) isn\u2019t a flashy, consumer facing company in the tech sector like some of the companies previously mentioned. However, it is a critical player in the semiconductor industry that has seen impressive growth over the last several years.\n\nMicrochip designs and manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, and flash-IP integrated circuits, which are the brains of countless devices. They power a variety of industries, including automotive, industrial, energy storage, and consumer electronics. The reason the company could be undervalued lies in their valuation and the sheer pervasiveness of its technology. As the world becomes more automated, the demand for microcontrollers is bound to increase. Furthermore, Microchip\u2019s track record of steady growth and profitability lends a positive sign for the future. With a recent 26% hike to its quarterly dividend, Microchip remains well positioned for strong growth while returning cash to shareholders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Airbnb CEO\u2019s 10-Year Pay Package Could Turn Into $1 Billion or More",
        "content": "Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky speaking with Skift CEO Rafat Ali At Skift Global Forum in September 2022. Source: Skift Skift\n\nAirbnb turned heads in 2021 when it announced chairman and CEO Brian Chesky had been awarded a $120 million pay package the previous year that potentially included earning 12 million restricted stock units over the following decade.\n\nThe $120 million figure was for accounting purposes. However, the fair value of those stock units was estimated to be $430 million on the grant date of November 10, 2020, when then-privately held Airbnb\u2019s share price was $35.81.\n\nBut that was a month before the Airbnb IPO. By year\u2019s end 2020, the stock traded above $145.\n\nIt may turn out that the 10-year package for Chesky could soar to $1 billion or more if Airbnb\u2019s share price hits certain price targets during each of the 10 years, and he remains CEO.\n\n$1.3 Billion Value for 2023-2030\n\nIn a proxy statement issued late last month that included its executive pay figures, Airbnb noted that the potential value of Chesky\u2019s eight remaining tranches of unearned shares at the end of 2023 was $1.3 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s the value at the end of 2023 of the remaining 9.6 million shares in the 12 million share package that haven\u2019t already vested. These would be for years 2023-2030.\n\nBut Chesky\u2019s actually receiving them is far from a sure thing. Let\u2019s look at what Chesky has received so far, and the hurdles he needs to clear to hit that potential payout.\n\nPayouts come two years after the vesting eligibility date.\n\nTranche 1: These vested in November 2021 with a stock price hurdle of $125. Airbnb cleared that and Chesky netted around $136 million in November 2023. That payment was based on the share price in November 2023.\n\nTranche 2: Chesky earned this tranche in late 2021, and the shares vested in November 2022 with a hurdle of $165. Chesky won\u2019t receive the shares until November 2024. Based on Tuesday\u2019s closing share price of $156.66, that tranche would be worth about $188 million before taxes.\n\nTranche 3: These vested in November 2023 and were included in the $1.3 billion fair value estimate. But they had a stock price hurdle of $205 per share in 2023, and Airbnb shares didn\u2019t hit that mark.\n\nSo the two tranches already earned could potentially inflate the $1.3 billion figure because they weren\u2019t included in the estimate, but the unmet third tranche for 2023 may lower it.\n\nThat highlights the difficult nature of estimating the potential payout because it is based on whether Airbnb\u2019s share price hits the designated thresholds, and the actual share price on the date an earned award settles.\n\n10 Tranches of Potential Stock Awards to the Airbnb CEO\n\nTough to Achieve\n\nFuture stock awards will be even tougher to achieve than the ones already earned. For example, the stock price hurdle is $245 per share in 2024, meaning the stock would need to average $245 over a 60-day trailing period. That stock price hurdle is $365 in 2027, and $485 in 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Airbnb hits those share price marks, Chesky and fellow shareholders would be making a lot of money.\n\nWhen the board initially awarded the pay package to Chesky, it made the following statement: \u201cIn designing the compensation program for Mr.\u00a0Chesky, our board of directors was cognizant of Mr.\u00a0Chesky\u2019s intention to contribute shares of our common stock worth over $100\u00a0million to support the Host Endowment Fund and to donate the net proceeds from the Multi-Year Award to community, philanthropic and charitable causes.\u201d\n\nSo the payout after Chesky\u2019s taxes get paid could ultimately go to programs to benefit Airbnb hosts \u2014 such as educational grants or emergency funds during pandemic-like crises \u2014 and various charities. Skift could not confirm if any contributions had already been made.\n\nWhat Chesky Already Owns\n\nEven if Airbnb doesn\u2019t hit the stock price hurdles over the next seven years, he still owns a lot of shares.\n\nChesky directly owned more than 14.3 million Class A Airbnb shares and another 187,000 indirectly through trusts, according to a February financial filing. Based on Tuesday\u2019s closing price of $156.66, those holdings would be worth nearly $2.3 billion.\n\nIn addition to the Class A shares, Chesky and co-founders Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia held 88.4% of the company\u2019s Class B shares, and wielded 79.4% of the company\u2019s voting power as of March 15, 2023.\n\nThe Airbnb CEO\u2019s base salary in 2023 was $1, and the company paid $295,124 for his personal security costs that it labeled \u201call other compensation.\u201d\n\nThe median employee pay last year at Airbnb was $243,757.\n\nAccommodations Sector Stock Index Performance Year-to-Date\n\nWhat am I looking at?

        "content": "Handing over the keys to Airbnb of a rented house by a tenant who isn\u2019t paying rent.Photograph: Imagebroker/Alamy\n\nI am banging my head against the wall with Airbnb, which is allowing a tenant to sublet my house illegally. She began to fall short on the monthly rent payments in early 2022. I had a good relationship with her, and showed patience and understanding. Last November, when the rent arrears had increased to \u00a318,600, I discovered that my house was listed on Airbnb, with reviews going back to April 2022. When I confronted the tenant, she ordered me to get out of her house, and has since stopped paying any rent. I asked Airbnb to remove the listing and had to provide proof of ownership before it would discuss the matter. It then told me it did not get involved in third-party disputes and referred me to the host. Relations with the tenant have completely broken down, so that is not an option. My house has continued to be listed on Airbnb, which is enabling the tenant to make money from my house, while refusing to pay rent. LA, Chigwell, Essex\n\nYour tenant signed an assured shorthold tenancy agreement that specifically bans subletting. That\u2019s of no consequence to Airbnb which, extraordinarily, does not require evidence that hosts are legitimate, although it was quick to demand legal documents from you.\n\nIn fact, it does not require any evidence of anything from hosts: not ID, nor insurance paperwork. All new hosts have to do is describe the property, add photos and launch.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe consequences of this insouciance can be harsh for guests, as well as hosts. In 2022 I reported the plight of a family evicted from their holiday rental by the owner who discovered a tenant had listed it illegally on Airbnb.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s aim seems to be to distance itself, as far as possible, from the host-guest contract to avoid any legal liability, while pocketing a percentage fee of every booking.\n\nRemarkably, when I questioned its policy, the company told me that your property had not had any reservations so far this year, as though that resolved the matter. Essentially, it relies on hosts to self-certify and has no plans to require proof of ownership and ID before a property is listed.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt said: \u201cWe have contacted the host regarding these concerns. We ask all hosts to ensure that they have permission to list their space, and remind them to check, and follow, local rules before they list, and throughout the year. \u201cThis is made clear in our terms of service, and on our responsible hosting page.\u201d\n\nAccording to campaign group Landlord Action, unauthorised subletting has soared during the cost-of-living crisis, and can leave owners with onerous legal liabilities.\n\n\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve advocated that short-stay platforms should enforce stringent security measures to verify ownership, yet progress remains limited,\u201d said founder Paul Shamplina.\n\nYou have now sought a repossession order and, in the meantime, your tenant, who has gallingly been promoted to \u201csuper host\u201d status for good behaviour, is continuing to list your house. And Airbnb will continue to pocket its cut from any bookings.\n\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

        "title": "Spring Fever: 3 Travel Stocks Set to Surge as Bookings Bloom",
        "content": "With pandemic-era travel restrictions behind us and an improving economic landscape ahead, travel stocks are adjusting to a new era of global travel. Consumer travel rates for air travel, hotel bookings and more are rising rapidly. While inflation certainly exerts some downward pressure on global and domestic travel, indicators of decreasing inflation suggest a potential travel surge as we march through 2024. This presents several top travel stocks to buy this year.\n\nThese travel stocks represent the best way to leverage this upward momentum with minimal risk. Each company holds a dominant market share in its respective category and is recovering strongly from the pandemic-era downturns, with per-share pricing rebounding toward or surpassing 2019 levels.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), recognized for its extensive travel services, including Priceline and Kayak, is an all-in-one travel stock set to boom as we enter the summer season. Though shares trade above $3,500, the company\u2019s strong financial performance and a positive sector outlook point to big things ahead. A subdued forecast in February pushed shares down nearly 10%, making today a perfect buying time \u2014 if you hurry. In 2023, its free cash flow per share reached $193.66. With huge institutional ownership, Booking Holdings is a cash-cow stock that uses hefty free cash flow to boost share pricing via a robust 8.87% total yield.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts expect Booking Holdings to grow as the global travel market recovers from the pandemic\u2019s impact. The company\u2019s latest earnings report supports this positive outlook, displaying a 16% year-over-year increase in quarterly gross travel bookings and a 24% annual growth in this area. Moreover, annual income jumped by 40% after a 25% rise in revenue, demonstrating management\u2019s ability to navigate higher interest rates and boost profit margins through effective cost control.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough the heyday of professional Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) hosts might be waning, this shift does not spell disaster for the travel stock giant. Instead, Airbnb\u2019s user base is returning to the platform\u2019s original concept of offering spare space as a budget-friendly alternative to hotels. Despite facing significant challenges, such as a $10 million fine for misleading international customers by listing prices in USD rather than local currencies, Airbnb\u2019s market dominance remains unchallenged.\n\nAirbnb holds a 20% share of the total vacation rental market, a remarkable achievement given its competition with established hotel chains. Additionally, the platform\u2019s listing and booking rates have climbed above their pre-pandemic levels in 2019, demonstrating Airbnb\u2019s effective navigation through the pandemic\u2019s obstacles.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Airbnb disclosed nearly a 17% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 15% rise in gross booking value. Spurred by the holiday travel surge, this growth is expected to continue as we move into the spring and summer travel seasons.\n\nTrip.com Group (TCOM) Trip.com Group logo on a smartphone. TCOM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nTrip.com Group (NASDAQ:TCOM), a Chinese travel stock, is returning after the government ended its Zero-Covid policies, with a 40% return since January 1st and prices approaching pre-pandemic levels. This recovery positions Trip.com Group for a potential surge as the company serves over half of the Chinese tourism market, including airline ticketing, hotel bookings and general travel planning.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the Chinese tourism market was a formidable economic force, with nearly 155 million Chinese tourists traveling internationally in 2019. This number plummeted to around 20 million in 2020. However, by the first half of 2023, nearly 40 million had traveled abroad and this upward trend is expected to continue, potentially driving TCOM\u2019s per-share price to new highs.\n\nAdditionally, Trip.com is expanding focus beyond China to capture a larger share of the broader Asian international travel market and explore other global markets. The company is also enhancing its digital and personalized service offerings to meet the changing needs of consumers, aiming to attract and retain attention and build brand loyalty in a highly competitive environment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "DoorDash upgraded, Airbnb downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nMoffettNathanson upgraded DoorDash (DASH) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $164, up from $118. The impetus behind the firm's previous DoorDash downgrade, student loan risks, has failed to materialize. BofA upgraded Nike (NKE) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $113, up from $110. Estimates are bottoming and \"finally look achievable,\" contends the firm, which also notes that the stock's multiple has compressed. Barclays upgraded Atlassian (TEAM) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $275, up from $235. The firm says a \"healthier\" growth profile with more enterprise customers on Atlassian's cloud solutions warrants a higher multiple for the shares given improved revenue \"durability.\" Evercore ISI upgraded Vertex Pharmaceuticals(VRTX) to Outperform from In Line with a $438 price target after the \"surprise move\" to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences (ALPN) for $65 per share or $4.9B in cash. UBS upgraded Gartner (IT) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $550, up from $484. The firm believes the company's contract value growth is likely to trough in Q1, re-accelerate in Q2, and exit the year growing double digits.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nNeedham downgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Hold from Buy without a price target. The firm believes the market has an overly optimistic view on Airbnb's potential to leverage artificial intelligence to disrupt the global online travel agency industry, and sees potential challenges in the company generating the global scale necessary to impact estimates, specifically the potential for price competition with incumbents and need to unlock hotels that likely see Airbnb as an existential threat. Citi downgraded Robinhood (HOOD) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $16, up from $13. Given the increase in stock price, Citi believes Robinhood's valuation levels \"have disconnected from the fundamental outlook.\" JPMorgan downgraded Altice USA(ATUS) to Underweight from Neutral without a price target. The firm cites the company's \"lengthy\" turnaround story as broadband momentum remains weak, persisting elevated competition, elevated leverage profile and limited cash flow generation, and low likelihood of an acquisition near-term for the downgrade. Wolfe Research downgraded Saia (SAIA) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's material outperformance. JPMorgan downgraded Hamilton Lane(HLNE) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $115. Though the firm sees upside still in the shares longer term and remains positive on the company, it sees tactical investment opportunities more attractive elsewhere in the near-term.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nJPMorgan reinstated coverage of Disney (DIS) with an Overweight rating and price target of $140, up from $120, following a period of restriction. While cautious on the media landscape due to pay TV subscriber losses and advertising headwinds, Disney is the firm's favorite in the group due to the company's \"unique\" content, improving streaming financials, and parks operation \"which provides an avenue to attractively deploy capital.\" Benchmark initiated coverage of Airbnb (ABNB) with a Buy rating and $190 price target. Even as competition increases in alternative accommodations within the broader travel market, research shows that Airbnb has retained its number one position with consumers, hosts, and unaffiliated travel experts, the firm tells investors in a research note. KeyBanc initiated coverage of Snowflake (SNOW) with an Overweight rating and $185 price target. The firm is positive on Snowflake's \"durable\" 20% growth, driven by continued legacy migrations, improving public cloud migration trends, a significantly expanding product portfolio, and the use of the company's \"easy-to-use\" governed platform for developing and hosting generative artificial intelligence workloads. Bernstein initiated coverage of Kenvue (KVUE) with an Underperform rating and $18 price target. Kenvue - the former Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Consumer Health business - has consistently lost market share across the majority of its business for the past several years, says the firm, which expects FY24 investment to prove \"inadequate\" and struggles to see \"a path to share stabilization absent significant further re-investment.\" TD Cowen initiated coverage of MasterCard (MA) with a Buy rating and $545 price target. The firm says MasterCard offers an \"attractive high-growth, high-margin business poised to deliver outsized expansion\" over the medium- to long-term. TD Cowen also started coverage of Visa (V) with a Buy rating and $320 price target, saying the company has a \"durable, high-margin business built on the leading scale of its global payments networks\" within a $45 trillion consumer spend market that retains \"healthy runway\" for digital payments penetration.",

        "content": "Victims of holiday scams are losing \u00a3765 on average, according to data from Lloyds Bank.\n\nIt said people aged 35 to 44, who are often booking trips for their families, make up more than a quarter (27%) of victims.\n\nFlight tickets are the most common fake item sold relating to holidays, Lloyds said.\n\nFraudsters use social media as well as booking websites to try to trick people, the bank added.\n\nLloyds suggested that rising flight costs in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic have led\u00a0people to turn to social media and lesser-known websites to look for cheaper deals.\n\nScammers will create fake ads for cheap flight deals or lure unsuspecting victims by pretending to sell airline tickets they can no longer use themselves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey will offer a low price and ask for a fee to change the name on the ticket.\n\nOnce the money has been sent, the scammer will disappear, leaving the victim out of pocket and without a ticket.\n\nThe offer of caravans for sale is the next most commonly reported fake item relating to holidays, according to Lloyds.\n\nThose hoping for their own motorhome or static caravan are offered a cheap price, but may be looking at photos of a vehicle that have been copied from elsewhere online.\n\nFraudsters will also list fictional holiday rentals with fake photos or photos stolen from other listings.\n\nThey may initially take a deposit through a legitimate website but will then ask for further payments offline, for example by bank transfer, before disappearing.\n\nIn some cases, victims may turn up with their suitcases, only to discover the address is fake or the \u201choliday rental\u201d is actually a home belonging to someone else, Lloyds said.\n\nAirbnb and Get Safe Online help raise awareness of holiday scams as new research finds that 18-34-year-olds are scammed more than any other age group and lose an average of \u00a31,150 in spite of being the most confident they would never fall victim to one https://t.co/Vcbtq4SDRv\n\n\u2014 GetSafeOnline.org (@GetSafeOnline) April 10, 2024\n\nLiz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cAlways take the time to think about purchases you make online, and when in doubt, always book through a trusted retailer.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to booking stays, always use your card and don\u2019t be fooled by hosts asking you to ignore the website\u2019s rules and transfer money directly to them.\u201d\n\nAirbnb, which has teamed up with online safety experts Get Safe Online to help protect people, said it has safeguards in place to help protect stays booked on its website, including secure payment processes.\n\nThe website said it also encourages consumers to report suspect websites or phishing emails to Airbnb for investigation and it works with third parties to report them for further action.\n\nAmanda Cupples, general manager for the UK and Northern Europe, Airbnb, said: \u201cAs people take advantage of the upcoming bank holidays, travellers should remain vigilant when browsing for their trips online and book directly with trusted providers.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all of our guests to book, communicate and pay for their stay on the Airbnb platform, where we have secure processes and support measures like AirCover in place to help keep our community safe.\u201d\n\nTony Neate, chief executive of Get Safe Online, said: \u201cMany of us book our holidays online, and it is so important that we can do so safely, securely and with confidence.\n\n\u201cTwo top pieces of advice to remember when booking trips and travel online \u2013 if a deal seems too good to be true, then it probably is, and, if you\u2019re booking with Airbnb, always stay on the platform when searching for a property and making payments.\u201d\n\nHere are some tips from Lloyds Bank\u00a0to stay safe from holiday scams:\n\n1. Purchase tickets and hotel stays from trusted retailers or directly from the airline or hotel. When booking stays, look for valid reviews on websites such as Tripadvisor.\n\n2. Paying by card can give added protections if something goes wrong.\n\n3. Pay through booking websites\u2019 own systems. If you are booking a hotel through a third party and receive what appears to be a message from the hotel asking for more money, after the original booking has been confirmed, do not pay this without contacting the website or the hotel directly using the contact details on their websites.\n\n4. Be cautious on social media. If you are looking to buy a caravan or motorhome, always see the item in person before handing over any form of deposit.\n\n5. If a seller is trying to rush you, or bombarding you with messages, take a step back and question whether this is pressure selling.\n\n6. Pay attention to warnings from your bank. Your bank is likely to provide a warning when you set up a new payee or make an unusual payment. Be sure to follow any advice provided.",

He now oversees advertising on the various Expedia Group brands, including Vrbo.\n\nTorres said individual property owners and large property management companies have expressed interest in sponsored listing for short-term rentals on Vrbo. \u201cIt\u2019s on our side to figure that out in my team and I am pushing them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re smart enough, we have technology, we innovated, we have to figure it out.\u201d\n\nAfter the interview Monday, an Expedia spokesperson said the idea of launching TravelAds on Vrbo \u201cis something Expedia Group is looking at. It isn\u2019t in progress yet and is still in a nascent discovery phase only.\u201d\n\nTravelAds and Flight Sponsored Listings\n\nExpedia Group currently lets hotels buy TravelAds and airlines purchase Flight Sponsored Listings, both of which enable them to boost the visibility of their listings for a cost per click on Expedia.com and Hotels.com.\n\nA TravelAd, or sponsored listing, placed by the Mercure Biarritz Centre Plaza Hotel in Biarritz, France on Expedia.com. Source: Expedia\n\nTorres said there have been a number of recent changes to Expedia\u2019s sponsored ads, which have been in existence for around two decades.\n\nWhat\u2019s Changed\n\nFor example, Expedia recently launched automated bidding for these ad placements. The auction used to be solely a manual process and parts of it still are, Torres said. But now it is more automated and Expedia can inform the advertiser when its budget is running low, or how its sponsored listing is faring against the competition, he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpedia already runs a limited amount of vacation rental sponsored listings on Expedia and Hotels.com, but not on Vrbo.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed for Vrbo is that it recently transitioned to a common backend tech platform with Expedia and Hotels.com. Torres said that enables Expedia Group to make available some of these sponsored ad features to Vrbo, but it\u2019s complex because unlike a hotel room, a vacation rental property can have unique features and they generally don\u2019t have the guest capacity that hotels have.\n\nExpedia Claims an Advantage\n\nAsked about any differentiation between Expedia\u2019s sponsored listings and that of the competition, Torres claimed that Expedia has more in-depth targeting capabilities, and has an advantage over Google, which doesn\u2019t process many bookings.\n\n\u201cWe have the full funnel,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe offer top of the funnel and bottom of the funnel so we know if somebody\u2019s actually converted, based on one of our sites versus of Google or someone. We can run that or incorporate that information into our data and insights so that we can actually make better decisions on who we\u2019re targeting these ads.\u201d\n\nExpedia touted its sponsored ads as a way for hotels to take advantage of big events such as Wimbledon last year where hotels using TravelAds in the Wimbledon area saw an average 30% revenue boost. Phoenix hotels generated a 15% boost over Super Bowl weekend, and when Taylor Swift played Nashville, TravelAds users saw a 5% revenue and booking boost, Expedia said.\n\nIt\u2019s about a 50-50 split between independent hotels and big brands that are using TravelAds, Torres said.\n\nMissed Opportunity for Airbnb?\n\nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky stirred up interest in sponsored listings for short-term rentals a year ago when he floated the idea of debuting them on Airbnb. Skift Research estimated at the time that if Airbnb had launched an ad platform in 2024 \u2014 it still doesn\u2019t have one \u2014 then it could have generated $1.2 billion in additional revenue annually by 2026.\n\nAirbnb officials subsequently said sponsored listings were not a priority because Airbnb chose to focus on its core business.\n\nTorres wouldn\u2019t comment on whether Airbnb was missing an opportunity by not pursuing sponsored listings.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really speak about them in terms of that,\u201d Torres said, referring to Airbnb. \u201cBut, I just think overall, we think it\u2019s a very great business.\u201d\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.",

        "content": "(Repeats story first published on Friday with no changes to text)\n\nBy Nathan Gomes, Deborah Mary Sophia and Akash Sriram\n\nApril 5 (Reuters) - The upcoming solar eclipse is proving to be a good omen for travel firms, as some parts of the United States that fall in the \"path of totality\" see unprecedented demand for lodging from eager Americans waiting to catch a glimpse of the celestial event.\n\nIn a total solar eclipse occurring on Monday April 8, the moon will blot out the sun for millions of people in Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nAirbnb listings along the U.S. path of totality, or the narrow strip stretching from Texas to Maine from where people will be able to view the sun's corona, have seen occupancy levels skyrocket to nearly 90%, the vacation rental firm said.\n\nOccupancy for all active rental listings across the path in the United States, Canada and Mexico was at 92.4% for the night of April 7, up sharply from about 30% a few days prior, according to travel data firm AirDNA.\n\n\"It is a nice bump in demand in a relatively slow period of the year. Typically April isn't a high point for short-term rental demand,\" said Jamie Lane, chief economist at AirDNA.\n\nShort-term rental listings in New Hampshire and Missouri, for example, are seeing demand surge 514% and 338%, respectively, for the week, AirDNA added.\n\nHotel, rental car and flight bookings have also tripled, data from consultancy firm Navan showed, with room prices in some cities seeing a more than two-fold rise. Niagara Falls, for instance, saw prices surge 249%.\n\nRental car company Hertz said advanced car bookings for April 6 jumped 3,000% in cities along the path of the eclipse. The company has been preparing for more than a year to meet the rush by boosting staffing and cars in high-demand areas.\n\nWith most hotels and rental properties being fully booked or listed at higher prices, some Americans are exploring the options of campsites and recreational vehicles to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Demand for eclipse camping has been huge - we've experienced a massive spike in bookings for stays this week,\" said Alyssa Ravasio, founder and CEO of camping firm Hipcamp, which saw weekly bookings in the region surge 9,000%.\n\nThe company is also seeing a surge in international visitors, with campers from countries including Japan, Iceland, Germany and Australia, Ravasio said.\n\n(Reporting by Nathan Gomes, Deborah Sophia and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "content": "By Nathan Gomes, Deborah Mary Sophia and Akash Sriram\n\nApril 5 (Reuters) - The upcoming solar eclipse is proving to be a good omen for travel firms, as some parts of the United States that fall in the \"path of totality\" see unprecedented demand for lodging from eager Americans waiting to catch a glimpse of the celestial event.\n\nIn a total solar eclipse occurring on Monday April 8, the moon will blot out the sun for millions of people in Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nAirbnb listings along the U.S. path of totality, or the narrow strip stretching from Texas to Maine from where people will be able to view the sun's corona, have seen occupancy levels skyrocket to nearly 90%, the vacation rental firm said.\n\nOccupancy for all active rental listings across the path in the United States, Canada and Mexico was at 92.4% for the night of April 7, up sharply from about 30% a few days prior, according to travel data firm AirDNA.\n\n\"It is a nice bump in demand in a relatively slow period of the year. Typically April isn't a high point for short-term rental demand,\" said Jamie Lane, chief economist at AirDNA.\n\nShort-term rental listings in New Hampshire and Missouri, for example, are seeing demand surge 514% and 338%, respectively, for the week, AirDNA added.\n\nHotel, rental car and flight bookings have also tripled, data from consultancy firm Navan showed, with room prices in some cities seeing a more than two-fold rise. Niagara Falls, for instance, saw prices surge 249%.\n\nRental car company Hertz said advanced car bookings for April 6 jumped 3,000% in cities along the path of the eclipse. The company has been preparing for more than a year to meet the rush by boosting staffing and cars in high-demand areas.\n\nWith most hotels and rental properties being fully booked or listed at higher prices, some Americans are exploring the options of campsites and recreational vehicles to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\n\n\"Demand for eclipse camping has been huge - we've experienced a massive spike in bookings for stays this week,\" said Alyssa Ravasio, founder and CEO of camping firm Hipcamp, which saw weekly bookings in the region surge 9,000%.\n\nThe company is also seeing a surge in international visitors, with campers from countries including Japan, Iceland, Germany and Australia, Ravasio said.\n\n(Reporting by Nathan Gomes, Deborah Sophia and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 40 least visited countries in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Least Visited Countries in the World.\n\nThe tourism industry is multifaceted. It is contingent on several other industries, including transport, accommodation, and more. According to a report by the United Nations Tourism, the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a 2.6 billion decrease in international arrivals all over the globe between 2020 and 2022 combined. The travel restrictions posed to control the spread of the pandemic also resulted in a 62% dip in export revenues generated by international tourism in 2020, which was the highest number ever recorded. 2021 saw another 59% decrease in international tourism export revenues as compared to the 2019 statistics. Although these numbers bounced back in 2022, they still remained 34% lower than the pre-pandemic statistics. The three-year timeline between 2020 and 2022 saw a $2.6 trillion total loss in export revenues from tourism. However, the tourism industry is recovering from the shocks of the pandemic. International tourist arrivals have bounced back to 88% of their pre-pandemic levels between January and December, 2023. To learn more about tourism, you can look at the Top 15 Countries for Dental Tourism and the 35 Best Destinations in the World for Cultural Tourism.\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on Global Travel\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had adverse effects on the global travel and tourism industry. The World Tourism Barometer put together by the United Nations World Travel Organization, showed that international tourist arrivals worldwide decreased over 80% between March and December, 2022.\n\nAnother report by the World Tourism and Travel Council showed that the share of travel and tourism\u2019s total contribution to GDP went from 10.4% in 2019 to 7.6% in 2020. It eventually went up to 9.2% in 2023 amidst more flexible travel restrictions and is anticipated to touch the 11.6% mark by 2033. The restrictions set in place to counter the spread of COVID-19 also affected the number of travel and tourism jobs around the world. The numbers fell to 271 million in 2020, as opposed to 334 million in 2019. Despite a gradual annual increase, the total number of jobs was still 13% lower in 2021, as compared to 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs the Travel and Tourism Industry Bouncing Back in 2024?\n\nThe travel and tourism industry experienced major setbacks due to the pandemic but is set to make a complete recovery in 2024. According to statistics from the United Nations\u2019 World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international tourist arrivals are highly likely to increase by 2% in 2024, as compared to 2019. The first UNWTO World Tourism Barometer of 2024 reported that international tourism made an 88% recovery to its pre-pandemic levels in 2023, with around 1.3 billion international travelers leading this change. The performance in Asia and the Pacific was mixed. South Asia already went back to 87% of its pre-pandemic international tourism levels in 2023, while North-East Asia went to about 55%. The Asian markets coming out of hibernation and resuming their tourism-related activities are a primary cause of this recovery, as well as improved air connectivity between countries.\n\nTourism recovery in Africa increased to around 96% of its pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Europe and the Americas recovered 94% and 90% of their tourism rates in 2023, respectively. However, recovery in the Middle East was the most promising, leading its pre-pandemic levels by 22% in 2023. You can also look at 35 Most Visited Countries in the World: 2024 Rankings.\n\nKey Players in the Travel and Tourism Industry\n\nThe travel and tourism industry is driven by several key players that ensure the provision of adequate travel, accommodation, and other services to travelers. The most prominent of these include Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), and Qatar Airways.\n\nAirbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has ushered in a new age of short-term rentals in competition with hotels and lodges. The company released its fourth-quarter and complete-year results for 2023 on February 13, reporting $2.22 billion in revenue, up 16.61% year over year and ahead of market estimates by $53.47 million. The results also marked the company\u2019s highest Q4 ever, with the total revenue increasing by 17% year-over-year. These results exceeded the company\u2019s expectations by totaling 99 million in Nights and Experiences Booked, with a 12% increase year-over-year. Airbnb Co-Founder and CEO Brian Chesky said in the company's Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"I am excited to share our results with you. We wrapped 2023 with another strong quarter. We had 99 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q4, marking our highest fourth quarter ever. Revenue of $2.2 billion grew 70% year-over-year. Net loss was $249 million. But when excluding nonrecurring tax items, adjusted net income was $489 million, representing an adjusted net income margin of 22%. For the full year, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion, our highest ever. Because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased $2.25 billion of our shares during 2023. And I\u2019m excited to announce that today, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion of our Class A common stock.\"\n\nAnother prominent player in the travel and tourism industry is Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), offering tourists its hospitality services. On March 26, Bloomberg reported that the company is planning to expand its footprint into Africa. The continent has seen an increase in the demand of luxury hotel rooms and suites over the past years, leading Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) to double its operations in the region. A majority of the planned constructions will be luxurious and upscale. The decision also came after a positive output from JW Marriott Masai Mara Lodge that the company built in Kenya last year. Even though individual rooms in this lodge average more than $3,000 a night in costs, there are about 138 hotels in the Marriott chain under construction in Africa.\n\nA key industry driving global tourism is transportation, and Qatar Airways is one of the most notable airlines in the world. On March 15, Zawyareported that the company announced its codeshare partnership with Aer Lingus, providing travelers with increased access to destinations across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The partnership will also improve connectivity and facilitate air travel for travelers to destinations in Africa, Australia, Asia, Middle East, Africa, and New Zealand. On March 26, Nasdaq reported that Qatar Airways has become the first airline in the world to announce an AI assistant on its airport premises. This \u201cdigital human in aviation,\u201d is named Sama 2.0. The AI assistant will help clear passenger queries and allow them to book flights seamlessly. It would also assist the airline in providing essential travel information about on-board series and other airline-related topics. Sama 2.0 is a second generation AI, and is relatively more human-like than its first version. Not only does it have realistic expressions, but it also imitates human breathing.\n\nNow that we have taken an overview of the travel and tourism industry, let\u2019s look at the 40 least visited countries in the world.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned +0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb belongs, has gained 2.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAirbnb is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +66.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -35.4%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.40 indicates a change of +15.4% from what Airbnb is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Airbnb.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Airbnb, the consensus sales estimate of $2.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.4%. The $11.07 billion and $12.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.6% and +11.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb reported revenues of $2.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.6%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.57%. The EPS surprise was +13.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "There may be no more important business leader these days than OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman's company kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) boom with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, and since then it's remained at the cutting edge of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nIt's received an estimated $13 billion in investments from Microsoft and forged a close partnership with the tech giant, powering AI on products like Azure, Github, and Office. OpenAI has also continued to impress with its own products such as Dall-E, a text-to-image generator, and Sora, a text-to-video generator, in addition to ChatGPT.\n\nPrior to serving as OpenAI CEO, Altman led Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator, and he's made a number of successful investments in start-ups through various funds that have helped him become a billionaire. Keep reading to see four stocks Altman has invested in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Reddit\n\nProbably the best known of Altman's investments is Reddit (NYSE: RDDT). The social media company revealed Altman to be a major investor in its initial pubic offering (IPO) paperwork. His stake was estimated to be worth $600 million after Reddit's post-IPO pop.\n\nAltman knows Reddit well. He previously served on the company's board and was even its CEO for eight days. He also said in 2014 when he announced his investment in Reddit that he had been a daily Reddit user for the last nine years and got to know Reddit's founders at Y Combinator.\n\nOpenAI also used Reddit's content to train its AI models, and Reddit has sold itself on its AI potential as it believes it has a competitive advantage in AI training data.\n\nAltman clearly knows the company well and, thus far, his investment has paid off.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAltman is good friends with Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky. The two consulted on various initiatives in the past, and Chesky came to Altman's defense when he was briefly fired as OpenAI's CEO.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltman invested $100,000 in Airbnb in 2008 when the company was in its short-term rental infancy.\n\nIt's unclear what the current status of Altman's investment is, but it's paid off handsomely for the OpenAI CEO even if he already sold it. Airbnb continues to grow the top line and generates a wide operating margin, a sign of its competitive advantage.\n\nToday, Airbnb has a market cap of $106.8 billion and is the clear leader in its market.\n\n3. Uber\n\nAltman was also an early investor in Uber (NYSE: UBER), putting $100,000 into the ride-sharing app and recognizing the potential for an app-based transportation marketplace.\n\nIn a blog post in 2014, Altman argued that Uber was undervalued because it often presents a more affordable alternative to car ownership.\n\nHe also frequently uses Uber, showing he's a fan of both the products and the business.\n\nLike Airbnb, investing in Uber in its early days has paid off handsomely. The company now has a market cap of $162 billion, and it dominates the global ride-sharing industry.\n\n4. Asana\n\nIt's clear Altman is a fan of marketplaces like Airbnb and Uber, and he's also an investor in Instacart and DoorDash, but the OpenAI chief has made a few investments in software companies like Asana (NYSE: ASAN), which specializes in collaboration and project management tools.\n\nAltman was the lead investor in Asana's $50 million Series C round in March 2016 and also participated in the follow-up $75 million investing round in January 2018.\n\nAt the time of his first investment, Altman argued that Asana solved a lot of the communication problems in business such as giving clear tasks and goals and having clear and frequent measurements. He also predicted that Asana could someday massively increase the productivity of hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n\nAsana has been a disappointment as a publicly traded company thus far and is now trading below its $27 IPO price.\n\nWhich Altman stock is the best buy now?\n\nOf the four stocks above, Airbnb seems the best bet for long-term returns. The company continues to deliver steady growth in its core travel business. Its margins are strong and expanding, and the travel specialist has responded to customer complaints about things like cleaning fees and chore lists to make the platform stronger.\n\nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky has also teased new products, saying the company would move beyond the core, which could open up Airbnb to new revenue streams.\n\nUber has also made an impressive comeback over the last two years, benefiting from cost cuts and the economic reopening.\n\nAsana is still unprofitable and its stock has underperformed, and Reddit could be overheating after a promising IPO.\n\nEven the OpenAI CEO can't be right every time, but he spotted the promise of new marketplaces like Airbnb and Uber over a decade ago. Today, they remain outstanding businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Reddit right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Reddit, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Reddit wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "This article looks at the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Over-Tourism, you may go ahead to 5 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia.\n\nTourism was one of the most impacted industries by COVID-19. Lock downs and travel restrictions brought the industry to a grinding halt for much of 2020. According to UNWTO, global tourist arrivals fell from 1.5 billion in 2019 to just 381 million in 2020, a staggering 74% decrease. This shift led to massive losses for companies operating in the hospitality and travel sectors, resulting in losses, layoffs, and shutdowns in unprecedented numbers. According to ECBM, at the peak of the pandemic, the hospitality industry reduced its workforce by over 18%, equating to a loss of 62 million jobs around the world.\n\nDespite this, the tourism industry managed to wither the storm and began to show signs of gradual recovery in 2021. Since then, the resurgence of tourism has picked up momentum, aided by the fact that the WHO has declared COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency as of May 2023. In 2023, global tourist arrivals recovered to approximately 88% of pre-pandemic arrivals. Moreover, revenue generated by the industry reached approximately $1.4 trillion, 93% of the $1.5 trillion generated in 2019.\n\nBased on these trends, it is anticipated that 2024 will be the year in which global tourism surpasses pre-pandemic figures, in terms of both tourist arrivals and revenue, therefore asserting that the industry has well and truly recouped from the aftermath of the pandemic. However, the revival of global tourism might prove to be a double-edged sword as it brings forth the threat of over-tourism.\n\nOver Tourism\n\nThe resurgence of global tourism brings with it several new, and old, challenges. One such challenge is the issue of over-tourism. Over-tourism is essentially the idea of a greater than optimal number of tourists visiting any given area. If left unchecked, excessive tourists can have economic, social, and environmental repercussions that impact the longevity and sustainability of any destination.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent years, the use of travel platforms such as Booking.com (a project of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG)) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) have made it incredibly convenient for tourists to customize their vacation itineraries. Using these platforms, tourists are able to obtain cheaper accommodations, knowledge regarding the best rated excursions, and all-inclusive packages. However, such convenience has resulted in an inflow of tourists into popular hot-spots without accounting for the fact that many of these destinations do not have the infrastructure to accommodate a high volume of tourists. Consequently, many such destinations are being rated as the most overrated travel destinations in the world.\n\nOne of the most evident cases of over-tourism is Hawaii. In 2023, the islands welcomed 9.5 million visitors who brought along $16 billion in tourism revenue to the islands. However, the insane demand for tourism has caused a sharp rise in housing costs over the last decade, consequently making it impossible for the native population to afford homes.\n\nApart from social distress, New York Times suggested that Hawaii\u2019s housing crisis might have far wider environmental implications. Referring to the 2023 wildfires which claimed the lives of 96 individuals, the article suggested that the ongoing housing crisis has increased the homeless population on the islands, many of whom cook outside, which in turn increases the risk of wildfire ignitions. In response, the governor of Hawaii recently proposed a $25 tax on all tourists, with the proceeds being used to ensure the islands\u2019 sustainability.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) has faced fierce criticism and reprimand for fueling over-tourism. Many European countries have introduced strict regulations on rental accommodations. From July of 2024, Vienna has placed a citywide restriction on house rentals meaning that owners can only rent out units to tourists for 90 days per year. Berlin, on the other hand, introduced a complete ban on Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) and similar platforms in 2016, however, this was later relaxed in 2018. Instead, owners must now obtain permits in order to rent out their accommodation.\n\nAs more and more governments introduce regulations on travel and tourism, platforms like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) are looking to adapt accordingly. In 2019, Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) launched the UNESCO sustainable travel pledge with the objective of providing travelers with visibility into travel companies committed to sustainability. Both Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) joined the Travalyst coalition in 2019 which aims to promote solutions that will make travel more sustainable.\n\nOver Tourism and Asia\n\nIn comparison to the rest of the world, tourism in the Asia-Pacific region has not been able to revive at the same pace as the rest of the world. In Asia-Pacific, tourist arrivals in 2023 were only 65% of pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, countries are showing concerns for the sustainability of tourism in their regions.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, tourist arrivals in Japan recovered to 25 million in 2023, approximately 79% of arrivals witnessed in 2019. Despite this, the tourism ministry recently revealed plans to counter over tourism which includes mechanisms to draw tourists towards lesser-known destinations. In addition, Euronews reported in November that the city of Hatsukaichi has implemented a tourist tax on visitors to the Itsukushima Shrine.\n\nIn Indonesia, the alarm bells already seem to be ringing as the country looks to avoid the pitfalls of over-tourism. Bali alone saw the arrival of 5.3 million foreign tourists in 2023 and was criticized as being one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. This accounted for nearly 46% of Indonesia\u2019s 11.7 million foreign tourists in 2023. According to the Bali Sun, Indonesia Minister for Tourism and Creative Economies announced that the country would be taking stern measures to develop quality and sustainable tourism in Bali.\n\nApart from over-tourism, many tourist destinations in Asia tend to provide a disappointing tourist experience on account of pollution and safety concerns. In other cases, tourists fall victim to scams by locals. Even though such scams tend to impact only a minor proportion of tourists, they yield massive negative publicity which impacts on the reputation of any destination. Recently, in Tokyo, tourists who had booked a luxury accommodation using Booking.com found out they had been scammed on arrival as the hotel they were supposed to check into never existed.\n\nIf you plan on visiting Asia, you might be interested in finding out which popular destinations are likely to provide a disappointing experience.

You might also find our list of 20 Cheapest Asian Countries That You Can Travel To Affordably to be insightful in this quest. 20 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia\n\n20 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of 20 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia, we began by combing through similar lists on the web. We compiled over 15 notable sources such as The Travel, Times of India, and Business Insider, to develop a preliminary list of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. Using these lists, we also developed a scorecard with 2 metrics.\n\nThe first metric was the frequency of destinations in our sources. The second metric was a ranking factor based on the average position of the destinations in their lists. This was calculated by first dividing the position of a destination in each list by the total number of destinations in the list. For lists that did not rank destinations, an average score of 0.5 was used. Our ranking factor was calculated as the average of these scores (across all sources) for a particular destination. By accumulating the frequency and ranking factors, we calculated our Insider Monkey scores. Once sorted in descending order, the first 20 destinations were selected as the 20 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are 20 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia.\n\n20. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.23\n\nThere are several reasons why Kuala Lumpur is considered to be one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. The capital city of Malaysia was once renowned for its unique culture and heritage, however, due to urbanization and development, much of the city\u2019s traditional sites have been replaced by contemporary attractions. Thus, it has become incredibly unlikely to obtain an authentic cultural experience in the city. Moreover, the feature attraction of Petronas Twin Towers, albeit beautiful, has become a hassle to visit. Since tickets are limited, many tourists are unable to visit the towers and even the ones who do have to deal with the fact that this viewing experience is quite expensive.\n\n19. Sihanoukville, Cambodia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.48\n\nThe coastal city of Sihanoukville features Cambodia\u2019s premier beach attractions. Many of the tourists who visit Cambodia for its incredible historical landmarks often save a day or two to visit Sihanoukville for beach side activities. However, the city tends to be extremely congested due to a mixture of excessive tourists and continuous road closures due to construction activities. Moreover, it has become increasingly notorious for littered beaches and unhygienic accommodations. The city is also considered to be unsafe for tourists due to a high crime rate.\n\n18. Da Nang, Vietnam\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.57\n\nThe coastal city of Da Nang is famous for its beaches, historical landmarks, and cultural excursions. Since the city has everything that tourists seek in a perfect vacation, it has become an increasingly popular travel destination with approximately 7.4 million visitors in 2023, per VietnamPlus. However, this surge of tourists has made the city\u2019s popular attractions, such as the Golden Bridge, extremely crowded. In lieu of sustainable tourism practices, rapid commercialization in the city and its coasts poses a threat to the natural beauty of Da Nang and makes vacationing in the city an extremely overrated experience.\n\n17. Manila, Philippines\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.29\n\nManila sees much fewer tourists in comparison to other capital cities in the region such as Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta. Despite this, Manila\u2019s infrastructure already seems incapable of managing current tourist volumes. The city is polluted to the point that tourists with any form of respiratory condition should reconsider their visit. There are also safety concerns which mean that several localities in the city are considered unsafe to tour. Overall, while the city does house many notable landmarks, it is one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia.\n\n16. Hong Kong, China\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.33\n\nHong Kong is one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia due to the fact that it is one of the most densely populated areas in the entire continent. According to the government of Hong Kong\u2019s website, it had a population density of 6,740 people per square kilometer, as of mid-2022. Therefore, any trip to Hong Kong tends to be ruined by traffic and over-crowdedness. Moreover, the destination is extremely expensive, even when compared to metropolitans in Europe and the rest of Asia. Even without considering excursions, the cost of food, transport, and accommodation is enough to price out most budget-conscious travelers.\n\n15. Kyoto, Japan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.41\n\nIn comparison to other destinations on the list, Kyoto is a city where residents have more of an issue with over tourism than tourists. Kyoto is set to reach pre-pandemic levels in terms of tourist arrivals, and the city has introduced several regulations to deal with the threat of excessive tourists. According to the NZ Herald, the city has restricted tourists from visiting several private streets in the city. Moreover, the city\u2019s new mayor has vowed to introduce a 2-tier transport system under which tourists would be charged higher fees. Although the city claims these measures are being used to make tourism sustainable, the reality is that tourists continue to rush into the city, with the only change being that their experience is now more expensive than it used to be.\n\n14. Fiji\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.47\n\nFiji is famous for its pristine beaches and mesmerizing corals. However, the destination is incredibly expensive in terms of accommodation. Resorts and hotels in prominent locations such as Denarau Island tend to be quite costly, and downgrading to more economical alternatives forces you to significantly compromise on amenities. Moreover, a vacation in Fiji can prove extremely unsatisfying depending on the weather. The wet season can often prolong into the early weeks of summer, meaning that the vacation is often disrupted by intermittent or heavy rainfall. Many of the beaches are located in a cyclone-prone region which can cause serious inconvenience.\n\n13. Shanghai, China\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.62\n\nIf you plan on visiting China for a vacation, there are a myriad of locations to choose from. In comparison to other cities in the country, Shanghai is one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. Despite sufficient infrastructure, the city is as expensive as it is vast. According to USGS, the city\u2019s population crossed 24 million in 2023. Owing to rapid urbanization, getting cheap accommodation in the city is extremely difficult, and vacation costs are further aggravated by the sheer distance you are required to cover in order to enjoy the city\u2019s best attractions.\n\n12. Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.65\n\nIndonesia features some of the most popular vacation destinations in the world, however, its capital city of Jakarta is one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. Whilst it may be the economic backbone of Indonesia, the city does not offer enough attractions and infrastructure to adequately cater to its large population. According to StraitsTimes, in a survey of 390 global cities in 2022, Jakarta was the 29th most congested city in the list. Further, it was also the 9th most congested city in Asia. In comparison, many of Indonesia\u2019s islands offer a much better itinerary and value for your buck.\n\n11. Penang Island, Malaysia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.47\n\nPenang Island in Malaysia is home to several tourist attractions such as the heritage sites of George Town and the picturesque Penang Hill. The area is famous for its vibrant and diverse blend of cultures along with its culinary delights. However, it has now transformed into an expensive and overrun hot spot, making it one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. The Penang region is one of the most densely populated areas in Malaysia, and a scarcity of land suitable for construction has resulted in a steep increase in rents. Last year, Penang Hill was named Asia\u2019s worst tourist trap by USA Today.\n\n10. Boracay Island, Philippines\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.69\n\nIn the last decade, Boracay Island has faced massive interventions in the hope of sustainable tourism. In 2018, the government of the Philippines shut the island down for nearly 6 months, attempting to enforce regulations to ensure the destination did not end up becoming a cesspool. Ever since there has been a struggle to find a balance between sustainable tourism and maintaining revenue. Lately, many of the policies introduced by the government have been relaxed due to protests by the local community, whose livelihood is compromised by any reduction in tourists. As a result, the government has increased caps on the number of tourists permitted to the island, despite the fact that pollution from illegally pumped sewage and littered beaches continues to spoil the tourist experience.\n\n9. Pattaya, Thailand\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.24\n\nPattaya is the party capital of Thailand and is known for its vibrant (and often ominous) nightlife. Apart from sex tourism, there are several islands off the coast of Pattaya which offer outdoor excursions and watersports. Pattaya is regarded as being Asia\u2019s sin city, however, in all other respects, it is one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. Pattaya\u2019s beaches are overrun with garbage and unfit for swimming. Its famous Walking Street is notorious for the exploitation of escorts which tends to be off-putting for many tourists, and if that is the case you won\u2019t find anything else to do on your vacation in this city.\n\n8. Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.36\n\nHanoi is the capital city of Vietnam and is considered to be a pleasant vacation destination. However, if you\u2019re looking to go to the city in hopes of touring its traditional attractions, you might find it to be one of the most overrated travel destinations in Asia. Although the city has a variety of tourist attractions, one of its most prominent destinations is the Old Quarter. Owing to its popularity, this area of the city is consistently overcrowded and chaotic, leading to an underwhelming experience. Another factor is that Vietnam is home to many other tourist destinations that tend to offer a better vacation experience than Hanoi. If you\u2019re interested in exploring these, check out our list of 20 Most Underrated Travel Destinations in Asia.\n\n7. Maldives\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.43\n\nIt would be wrong to classify Maldives as an overcrowded or disappointing holiday retreat. It is home to some of the most extravagant hotels and some of the most pristine beaches on the planet. However, the islands of Maldives are insanely focused on luxury tourism, meaning that unless you have the financial resources to afford its expensive resorts and excursions, there isn\u2019t much you can get out of your vacation other than sunbathing. In comparison, there are many beach destinations in Asia that offer budget-friendly vacations with comparable itineraries. Another issue with Maldives is that because of commercialization throughout the archipelago, it is impossible to get an authentic experience in which you can immerse yourself within the local community.\n\n6. Tokyo, Japan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.51\n\nAlthough Tokyo has a clean and vibrant vibe, with an extremely welcoming community and beautiful city scape, a vacation to the city has several underlying problems. Firstly, due to overcrowdedness, the entire city seems to feel claustrophobic. This includes the city\u2019s public transport as well as its attractions. Moreover, attractions such as Disneyland have turned into a hot-spot for over-tourism, meaning that each ride has a waiting time of an hour, no matter which season you visit. Further, owing to rapid development and urbanization, the city has lost touch with its cultural heritage, meaning that you are unlikely to get an authentic cultural experience.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Biggest Spanish Companies 15 Biggest Swiss Companies 20 Most Underrated Bourbons on the Market\n\nDisclosure: none.\u00a020 Most Overrated Travel Destinations in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 28, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Airbnb ABNB, Angi ANGI and Perion Network PERI.\n\nIndustry: Internet Content\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2246509/3-internet-stocks-to-buy-from-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Content industry is benefiting from solid demand for digital offerings, as well as the increasing importance of video content and cloud-based applications. The proliferation of AI and rapid deployment of generative AI is benefiting industry players. Participants like Airbnb, Angi and Perion Network are also expanding their presence across social media, display and connected TV, and search, driving top-line growth.\n\nHowever, the industry has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions globally. Persistent inflation and higher interest rates are having a detrimental effect on ad spending, the primary revenue source for the industry participants. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, as well as in Israel, has been an overhang on the prospects of the industry participants.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Content industry comprises providers of video encoding platforms, personal services, Internet content and information, staffing and outsourcing services, publishing, capital markets, media-based, home service, digital insights and measurement, stock photo, video and music licensing, and online travel companies. The industry is witnessing a rapid change in consumer behavior and ongoing digitalization. Advertising is a major revenue source for industry participants.\n\nTherefore, these companies are trying to expand their digital presence to win customers. They are also expanding their presence across social media, display and connected TV, and search. Apart from the United States, a number of companies in this industry are located in Israel, the U.K., Germany, Russia and China.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Internet - Content Industry\n\nDemand for Digital Offerings Growing: The industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service introductions, and evolving standards. An expanding range of mobile, digital and cloud-based offerings by industry participants is a major growth driver. Moreover, the proliferation of smart devices and increasing automation of the application development process bodes well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry Prospects are Driven by Ad Spending Rate: Industry participants are focusing on marketing efforts to boost traffic to websites. Advertising and subscriptions are major revenue sources for these companies. Also, the industry is dependent on consumer spending trends, making holiday spending a major deciding factor. However, macroeconomic challenges, lingering effects of the pandemic, raging inflation and higher interest rates are expected to hurt ad spending in the near term.\n\nIncreasing Regulations Mar Prospects: Industry participants involved in online search and other social networking activities are increasingly facing regulatory pressure, particularly in China and the European Union (\"EU\"). The China government has a number of regulations related to direct advertising, which is a prime revenue source for these companies.\n\nThe implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect on May 25, 2018, in the EU, adds to the concerns. Enactment of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU aims to prevent large online platforms, which connect users with content, goods, information and services, from abusing their market power. DMA further adds to the headwind already faced by the Internet content providers in the EU.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Content industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

        "title": "A million solar eclipse enthusiasts expected at Niagara Falls",
        "content": "By Wa Lone and Nivedita Balu\n\nNIAGARA FALLS, Ontario, March 28 (Reuters) - From vintage train rides costing almost $4,000 per person to hotel rooms listed at $1,600 a night, businesses in and around majestic Niagara Falls are preparing to cash in on the April 8 total solar eclipse - with around a million visitors expected.\n\nThe dramatic waterfall, situated along the Canadian-U.S. border, is in the path of the eclipse, and many people are splurging on hotels and rentals in advance to experience the phenomenon at one of North America's natural wonders. Demand has pushed up prices of hotels as people making last-minute plans book the last of the available accommodations.\n\nThe eclipse will be a busy time both on the Ontario side and the New York side of the waterfall, with numerous special activities planned.\n\nMany enthusiasts are planning to drive thousands of miles (km) across Canada to be there when the moon's shadow covers the sun for about three to four minutes starting at 3:20 p.m ET. For Canada, this marks the first total solar eclipse since 1979, with the next forecast for 2044.\n\nJim Diodati, mayor of the Ontario city of Niagara Falls, predicted \"by far the biggest crowd that we've ever had\" on the Canadian side for the eclipse. Diodati estimated that up to a million people will be there, compared with the 14 million who typically visit during the course of an entire year.\n\n\"Clear weather is the cherry on top,\" Diodati said. \"I'm just keeping fingers crossed and hoping.\"\n\nMost hotel rooms are booked and prices are higher than usual, according to Janice Thomson, president and CEO of Niagara Falls Tourism.\n\nMany hotel rooms were priced at C$1,000 per night and above - and some boasting views of the falls even reached around C$2,200 ($1,620).\n\nThe region, which includes the municipalities of Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and St. Catharines, is one of the most heavily booked Airbnb destinations in Canada for the eclipse, according to the lodging service.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Percy, president and CEO of regional tourism promotional agency Destination Niagara USA, said in a press release that he expects the eclipse to bring \"the largest influx of visitors we've ever seen\" to the U.S. side of the falls.\n\nPARTY ATMOSPHERE\n\nHotel company Hilton's property that overlooks the falls is hosting a \"parking lot party\" offering eclipse views from its outdoor venue along with live music, a DJ and food trucks - priced at a C$10 entry fee, which includes a pair of protective solar eclipse glasses and a souvenir drink cup.\n\nHilton's falls-facing rooms, which typically cost about C$200 a night, were priced at more than C$1,000 for the eclipse period. Prices at Marriott's Sheraton Hotel were upwards of C$1,000 a night, compared to about C$250 a night for a weekend later in the month.\n\nOn the U.S. side, a vintage train will be taking people from New York City to Niagara Falls, with tickets at nearly $4,000 per person.\n\nNiagara Falls-based hoteliers and business owners have had the event on their radar for years, hoping to recoup losses they experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Small businesses are staffing up.\n\nGabriel Gabrie, owner of Bravo! Pizzeria & Grill in Ontario's Niagara Falls, said the solar eclipse will bring \"more people and more luck.\"\n\n\"I am calling back our staffs from the previous year and training them again. We are expecting to have a full house,\" Gabrie said.\n\nSome visitors like University of Toronto physics professor Jason Harlow will travel with their families.\n\n\"Seeing something that's so rare and so beautiful - to see the stars come out in the day - yeah, something that my kids will remember their whole lives,\" Harlow said.\n\n($1 = 1.3568 Canadian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Wa Lone and Nivedita Balu in Toronto; Editing by Will Dunham and Denny Thomas)",

        "content": "Forced to cancel a stay in Toronto when the host raised the price by \u00a34,000 \u2026 after the booking.Photograph: M4OS Photos/Alamy\n\nMy daughter used my credit card to book a five-month stay using Airbnb after taking up an internship in Toronto. After the host accepted the booking, she got an email saying the price for the overall stay had increased by \u00a34,000 \u2013 a further 39%.\n\nPanicked, and unable to afford the extra sum, she cancelled. Airbnb has taken a \u00a31,962 fee, plus a further \u00a3682 for cleaning and taxes. As my daughter cancelled immediately, it is extremely unlikely that a booking was lost.\n\nAirbnb is endlessly quoting T&Cs and says it has asked the host to return the money, but he won\u2019t. It feels as if it has assisted this man to perpetuate what looks like a scam.\n\nJS, by email\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI am amazed Airbnb didn\u2019t sort this out in your favour before I became involved. A request for an extra 39% payment after the booking had been made \u2013 seriously? Happily, the company has now refunded you in full.\n\nIt told you that you should have declined the host\u2019s request for the extra sum. It would then have been up to the host to decide whether to go ahead at the original price, or to cancel.\n\nYou have to wonder who at the company came up with the T&Cs that allowed such a request to stand, but all\u2019s well that ends well. I hope your daughter enjoys Toronto.\n\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Alternatives to Expedia in 2024.\n\nTourism Industry: Recovering From a Global Pandemic\n\nThe pandemic gravely impacted the global tourism industry. In light of the travel ban and new restrictions, the inbound and outbound tourist flows in all countries dropped drastically. However, the industry is recovering quickly post-pandemic. According to a report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in 2023, international tourism was able to recover 88% of the pre-pandemic levels. The travel restrictions in place have created a pent-up demand that is now fuelling the growth of the market. In 2022, the number of international tourists was recorded to be 325 million. The number of international tourists increased by 34%, from 2022 to 2023, to reach 1.28 billion.\n\nThe tourist rates across various regions around the globe are recovering differently. The non-uniformity is caused by various factors including government policies, ease of traveling, and tourist attractions in the region. In 2023, the Middle East had the strongest tourism recovery rate and was able to surpass the pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, the number of international tourist arrivals in the Middle East was 22% ahead of the pre-pandemic levels. Europe was able to recover 94% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023, while Africa recovered 96% and the Americas recovered 90%.\n\nThe recovery of international tourist arrivals is adding to the global economy as well. In 2023, the estimates of tourism direct gross domestic product (TDGDP) point to $3.3 trillion. The TDGDP rate corresponds to 3% of the global GDP which is the same as the pre-pandemic level in 2019. The international tourism is expected to reach the pre-pandemic levels in 2024. Some estimates even suggest the surpassing of the pre-pandemic levels by 2% in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOnline travel booking platforms provide unmatched ease when planning a trip.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Cheapest Latin American Countries To Visit In 2024.\n\nTourism in Latin America\n\nThe global tourism industry took a major hit during COVID-19. Travel restrictions were imposed and tourism rates dropped drastically. The tourism industry in Latin America also suffered greatly during this tumultuous period. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the contribution of tourism to GDP in Latin America slumped from $490 billion in 2019 to $300 billion in 2020. The pandemic was marked by a drastic reduction in the number of tourism-related jobs in the region as well. The number of tourism-related jobs in Latin America dropped from 23 million in 2019 to 18 million in 2020. Almost 5 million people working in the tourism sector lost their jobs during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, as we made our exit from the pandemic era, the tourism industry has picked up momentum. The Latin American travel and tourism market is estimated to reach a value of $52.18 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.41% from 2024 to 2029 and reach $67.91 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The tourism industry around the globe is recovering and reaching back to the pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAccording to a report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the number of international arrivals in Latin America initially dropped by 63% in 2021, compared to 2019 numbers. The number of arrivals in Latin America recovered to around 29% of pre-pandemic levels in 2022. Finally, in 2023, global tourism had returned to 88% of the pre-pandemic levels. The Americas has shown remarkable recovery and recovered to 90% of the pre-pandemic visitors in 2023. The influx of tourists from the United States is expected to be a main contributor to the recovery of the Latin American tourism market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotable Travel Services Companies\n\nAirbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL), and Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) are some of the most prominent travel services companies.\n\nAirbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a global online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts offering lodging and experiences.

We delivered record fourth-quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which were ahead of our expectations. Finally, the GAAP and earnings per share in the quarter grew 29% year-over-year, helped by the reduction in our share count versus last year. At the start of 2024, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. As we look to the year ahead, we see strong growth on the books for travel that\u2019s scheduled to take place in 2024, which gives early indications of potentially another record summer travel season.

With that, let's take a look at the cheapest Latin American countries to travel to in 2024. 15 Cheapest Latin American Countries To Visit In 2024\n\n15 Cheapest Latin American Countries To Visit In 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the cheapest Latin American countries to visit in 2024, we initially used a consensus methodology. We sifted through 10 sources that listed the cheapest countries to visit in Latin America and tabulated the ones mentioned in at least 50% of the sources. We then checked the average flight fares and accommodation costs in each of the shortlisted countries. The rationale for using this metric was that flight and accommodation are inevitable costs of any visit, therefore, it can help gauge which of these places is the cheapest to visit. Furthermore, each of these countries has a variety of dining and activity options within every budget range. We have used Kayak to get the prices for flights and accommodation. The flight fares are round-trip, one person, with the starting location being Newark, New Jersey, to the capital city of the destination country. For the accommodation costs, we looked up options for a two-person room with more than 6 ratings in the capital cities. The data was collected on 21st March 2024 and is prone to change over time. It is important to note that these prices also vary based on where you are traveling from, the destination city, and the city of accommodation.\n\nAfter collecting the data, we aggregated the two costs to get a total. The total cost is our primary metric. The list has been arranged in descending order of the primary metric moving from the most expensive to the cheapest Latin American countries to visit in 2024.\n\n15 Cheapest Latin American Countries To Visit In 2024\n\n15.

        "content": "This article looks at 15 cheap alternatives to Aruba for a vacation. If you wish to skip our detailed introduction highlighting the benefits of vacations and what to expect when visiting Aruba, you may go to 5 Cheap Alternatives to Aruba.\n\nBenefits of Vacations\n\nThe never-ending chase to be a dedicated employee makes it easy to overlook one\u2019s health and productivity.\u00a0 Much like Icarus\u2019s desire to fly just that little bit higher, our professional ambitions often end up becoming the reason we fail to reach our true potential. In today\u2019s world, how we spend our time off work has massive repercussions on our ability to deliver inside the bullpen. In this context, there is no better way to rejuvenate your mind and body than a reclusive vacation. Sadly,\u00a0more than 50% of Americans give up paid time off each year. This is largely because of the misconception that unless you are a travel influencer, vacations are a luxury you simply cannot afford. Our list on countries with the most paid vacation days per year  reveals the same. It talks about how even though the US is one of the countries with the least vacation days, many US workers underutilize paid time off benefits. Referring to a Pew Research Center survey, it reveals that over 46% of employees take less time off than what their employers offer. Notably, 51% of upper-income workers underutilize this benefit, compared to their middle- and lower-income counterparts. Thankfully, vacations don't always have to break the bank. By avoiding extravagances like champagne and caviar, planning ahead, and choosing budget-friendly destinations, you can enjoy a beach getaway without financial strain. Websites such as Airbnb, Inc . (NASDAQ: ABNB) provide access to affordable accommodation for all vacation destinations around the world. Furthermore, you can use websites like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ :BKNG) to map out your entire trip from airline tickets to car rentals to activities that you plan on enjoying during your trip.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeach Vacations\n\nBeach vacations create a unique blend of tranquility and physical exertion that help your mind wander away from the stress and anxiety of your everyday life. Bathing under the soothing rays of an afternoon sun while the tide tickles your toes isn\u2019t just a good way to tan yourself, but also a very effective way of regulating your serotonin levels. Moreover, beach trips aren\u2019t just a summer activity anymore. According to Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB), the most booked categories for a family vacation during the recent winter season were poolside stays, beaches with surfing activities, and golf courses. Fittingly, major hotel chains such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) have beachfront resorts in various tropical destinations, such as Aruba, Bora Bora, and the Maldives. In 2023 alone, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) opened 19 new hotels containing more than 4000 rooms in the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nPablo Maturana, VP for Development, Caribbean and Latin America at Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) acknowledged the potential for leisure travel in the CALA region.\n\n\u201cThe record growth that we achieved in the region in 2023 is a result of our strategic focus to bring the right hotels to the right destinations\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to lay back and enjoy your vacation if you have to break the bank every time you buy a Pina Colada.\n\nVacationing in Aruba\n\nAruba, one of the most famous destinations in the world for a soothing holiday, is a prime example of how insanely expensive beach vacations are. On one hand, the island offers an experience like no other, allowing you to take part in beach activities like snorkeling & scuba diving, interacting with the native pink flamingos on the coast, and then hitting the clubs to enjoy some of the most electrifying parties in the world. Planning a vacation to Aruba is extremely convenient. One visit to Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) and you\u2019ll see that the island has regularly scheduled flights from most major US cities, and if you live on the East Coast, you can make the journey on some of the most luxurious cruises in the world.\n\nHowever, this experience is often ruined by the fact that each activity ends up costing over a hundred dollars per person. Not to mention that even some of the cheapest food options on the Island are so expensive that you end up spending between $80 to $120 on a single meal. Moreover, with over 1.24 million people visiting Aruba in 2023 (a number that continues to rise), the chances of availing discounts during any time of the year have diminished considerably.\n\nBecause of this, it may be worth asking what island is similar to Aruba for a vacation? While there are many other popular islands in proximity, such as the Bahamas or the Virgin Islands, these tend to be equally high-priced. Therefore, vacationers on a budget are forced to consider where can I go instead of the Caribbean? Consequently, we have scoured the web to develop a list of cheap alternatives to Aruba that offer the same combination of serenity and vibrancy, with the added bonus of being feasible to the average tourist. Our list comprises some of the most underrated destinations in the Caribbean, and Mediterranean Sea, as well as some based within the US.\n\nSince this list comprises beaches around the world, you may be interested in reviewing travel deals to help streamline your vacation. If so, you may find our list of Top 20 Most Valuable Travel Companies in the World (including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG)) very insightful. If you feel as though budget isn\u2019t much of a constraint for you, you may also want to check out our list of 20 Best Caribbean Islands to Visit for Families. 15 Cheap Alternatives to Aruba\n\n15 Cheap Alternatives to Aruba\n\nMethodology\n\nOur list of cheap alternatives to Aruba was compiled by using a consensus approach. We compiled lists published by several notable sources such as The Washington Post & CN Traveler. Wherever possible, we recorded specific destinations (rather than countries as a whole) as not all holiday destinations within a large country would have the same affordability. Using a consensus approach, we obtained a list of the most recommended cheap beach vacation destinations apart from Aruba. Our initial scoring was based on the number of times each place was recommended across different sources.\n\nOnce this list was obtained, we scored each location out of 5 on six different variables. These included overall costs, quality of beaches, variety of activities, quality of entertainment, whether tourists could visit round the year, and the cultural/ historical excursions available. This allowed us to score each destination out of 40, ranking them in order of their final accumulated scores. The places have been organized in ascending order according to their Insider Monkey (IM) scores, ranging from the lowest score to the highest.\n\nFor costs, we used budgetyourtrip to calculate the average vacation costs for a one-week couple's trip. Our research showed that a one-week trip to Aruba for 2 people would cost an average of $4,550. As this was a list of cheap alternatives to Aruba, all the places in our list have an average cost below $3,100 (except for Bonaire which has a cost of $3,682).\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are 15 Cheap Alternatives to Aruba:\n\n15. Morocco\n\nIM Score: 20\n\nWhile it's renowned for Medinas and Mosques, Morocco also hosts some of the most exotic all-season beaches in the world. The country has a shoreline along both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, with a climate that closely replicates Southern European nations such as Portugal and Spain. Oualidia, a village approximately 125 miles from the city of Marrakesh, has become a very popular destination for international tourists. Apart from acres of glistening gold sand, lush blue water, and beautiful flamingos, it also offers fun excursions such as wind surfing and kayaking. Moreover, in comparison to similar destinations around the world, the cost of food and accommodation is a bargain. The only drawback would be that in comparison to other destinations on our list, the beaches of Morocco may not appeal to revelers looking to hit the clubs once the night falls.\n\n14. Philippines\n\nIM Score: 23\n\nUnlike Bali and Phuket which no longer qualify as inexpensive, the Boracay island in the Philippines is still one of the best cheap alternatives to Aruba in the Orient. From paragliding to kiteboarding, there are numerous water sports for adventurers to pump their veins full of adrenaline. For those seeking a reclusive experience, there are many secluded beaches to enjoy moments of tranquility. Moreover, you can rent boats to neighboring islands in the Visayas archipelago at reasonable prices, allowing you to explore some of the Philippines\u2019 historical sites. Local fire dancing shows and nightclubs make for exciting nightlife as well.\n\n13. Myrtle Beach, USA\n\nIM Score: 23\n\nIf you\u2019ve failed to plan ahead for a trip, you might be alarmed when you search the web for a last-minute ticket to an international flight. If this is the case, you may wish to consider a destination that is closer to home. Myrtle Beach in South Carolina is one such destination that checks all the boxes for a relaxing vacation, whilst also being easy on the wallet. From hotels to Airbnbs, there is a range of affordable, cozy venues to select from. Moreover, the beach hosts a prominent boardwalk, dolphin viewing cruises, and live music festivals throughout most of the year.\n\n12. Dominican Republic\n\nIM Score: 24\n\nOne of the most budget-friendly options on our list, the city of Puerto Plata is a natural paradise. If your goal is to seek cheap alternatives to Aruba all-inclusive, you need not look any further. Unlike other locations where you may be compelled to forego accommodation in resorts on account of expensive meals, resorts in Puerto Plata tend to include food and excursions within your rent, thus making it easier to budget your trip accurately. Moreover, the town has a very dependable public transportation system, meaning that you need not worry about hailing expensive cabs or renting transport. Unlike other places, however, the variety of activities in this area is quite modest, with most common tourist excursions being trekking, sunbathing, and visiting the local markets.\n\n11. Spain\n\nIM Score: 24\n\nWhile Spain\u2019s popular beaches do not qualify as cheap alternatives to Aruba, the country also hosts some incredibly underrated holiday destinations. Costa del Sol, also known as the Sun Coast, is one such destination in the south of Spain. Depending on your budget, it may be smart to avoid luxury beach-view resorts and instead opt for accommodation inland. Luckily, there are many ways to get around, from cheap cabs to rental car services, making it one of the more viable destinations in Europe to enjoy an economical holiday. Apart from the usual water-sporting activities, it also offers world-renowned golf parks, historical tours in nearby towns, and incredible nightlife.\n\n10. Portugal\n\nIM Score: 26\n\nThe affordability of a vacation in The Algarve region of Portugal relies on several factors such as time of the year. Generally, prices in spring and fall tend to be remarkably more economical than in the summer. Moreover, as with other European destinations, the currency fluctuation of the Euro in comparison to the American Dollar is often a concern. However, The Algarve generally makes for a consistently cheap alternative to Aruba, particularly for vacations in excess of 5 days. Moreover, the area offers magical natural landmarks, such as the Benagil Sea Cave, arguably the most beautiful sea cave in the world. You can take a boat ride to enjoy Lagos\u2019s infamous grottos, or trek through the marshes of Ria Formosa, or simply bake yourself against the sand on one of the many beaches in the area.\n\n9. Turkey\n\nIM Score: 26\n\nAlthough people use vacations to offer some respite to their brains before another grueling 52 weeks behind a desk, some may want to go back to work with some inspiration. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re unlikely to find a better spot than Antalya Turkey. Affordable housing? Check. Bustling beaches? Affirmative. Historical significance? Be prepared to have your mind blown. Antalya is rooted in the history of all 3 Abrahamic religions, with numerous mosques, churches, and synagogues dating as far back as the 3rd century. Moreover, just a short trip away, you can visit the ruins of the city of Perge, built by Romans over 2000 years ago. The Temple of Artemis and the Grand Theatre are 2 of many sites still preserved today.\n\n8. Martinique\n\nIM Score: 27\n\nThe island of Martinique is a hidden gem among vacation destinations in the Caribbean. The island contains over 60 accessible beaches facing either the Caribbean Sea or the Atlantic Ocean. Plage des Salines and Grande Anse d'Arlet are two of the most famous coastal places on the island, offering activities such as paddle boarding, scuba diving, and other water sports. In comparison to other Caribbean Islands, Martinique has incredible diversity among its beaches, from purely white sand shores to black sand beaches. If you trek inland, you are likely to come across lush green mountains, breathtaking waterfalls, and colonial landmarks. The best thing is that many of the island\u2019s attractions are free to visit, which includes its most popular beaches and historical sites.\n\n7. Tybee Island, USA\n\nIM Score: 27\n\nTybee Island, located near Savannah Georgia, is another underrated beach vacation destination that should be considered by any American looking for a cheap alternative to Aruba. The island offers acres of accessible coastline, perfect to soak your dose of Vitamin D in. If that isn\u2019t for you, you may hop up on a jet ski and sail over the ferocious waves of the Atlantic. If you\u2019re a history geek, you can check out Fort Pulaski, a landmark of the civil war. Thus, whatever your poison is, it is likely you\u2019ll find a way to satisfy your craving at this destination.\n\n6. Panama\n\nIM Score: 30\n\nIf you're looking for a captivating tropical destination, Panama offers a unique blend of Caribbean and Pacific coastlines to explore. Even the capital itself, Panama City, is cheaper than areas such as Barbados, Costa Rica, and the Bahamas. However, you can just as easily find even cheaper accommodation in the town of Bocas del Toro, which hosts some of the finest mangrove-lined beaches in the region. Panama has the luxury of being bordered by both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, meaning that its beaches range from turquoise to crystal clear. It is a common destination for adventure tourists interested in surfing and zip-lining. Moreover, the islands offer a chance to interact with the Kuna culture, an indigenous settlement in the area.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Cheap Alternatives to Aruba.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n30 High-Quality Street Foods in the World 20 Best Products For Acne-Prone Skin in 2024 30 Most Spoken Languages in the World in 2050\n\nDisclosure: none.\u00a015Cheap Alternatives to Aruba is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "30 Countries With Most Paid Vacation Days Per Year",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30countries with the most paid vacation days per year. We have also talked about the companies that offer paid vacation days in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries With Most Paid Vacation Days Per Year.\n\nWhile US is largely known as one of the countries with the least vacation days, the Pew Research Center's recent study reveals that a large portion of US workers don't fully utilize their paid time off benefits. More than 4 in 10 employees, approximately 46%, take less time off than offered by their employers, according to the survey. Notably, upper-income workers exhibit a higher tendency of 51% to underutilize this benefit compared to middle- and lower-income counterparts.\n\nDisparities are also evident across educational attainment levels, with 51% of workers with a bachelor's degree or higher opting not to take all their available time off, contrasting with 41% of those with less education. Factors such as employment type and industry further influence this trend. Salaried employees (52%) and managers (54%) are more inclined to forego their allotted time off compared to hourly workers and non-managers. Moreover, workers in education (68%) and government/public administration/military sectors (57%) demonstrate higher rates of underutilization than those in other industries. While reasons for not taking all available time off vary, most common reasons are not feeling the need to, concerns about falling behind at work, and guilt about placing additional burdens on coworkers.\n\nSimilarly, less than two in 10 employees in Japan take annual paid leave, with Gen X employees being the most reluctant to do so, with 84% of them not utilizing their owed leave. This reluctance stems from deep-rooted cultural attitudes towards work ethic and a fear of inconveniencing others, as taking leave is often viewed as causing meiwaku, or inconvenience, to colleagues and clients. The pressure to prioritize work over personal time is further exacerbated by the belief that overtime or time spent at work, rather than on holiday, increases the chance of promotion, perpetuating a cycle of overwork.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite government reforms introduced in 2019 in Japan to address issues such as excessive overtime and unused leave, the cultural norms surrounding work persist. While initiatives like caps on working hours and premium pay for overtime have been implemented, there remains a major challenge in changing attitudes towards taking time off.\n\nIn the context of the US, where paid holiday isn't mandated by law, travel perks hold particular appeal. With rising living costs globally, offering paid holiday expenses becomes a significant value-add for employees. Moreover, the attraction of these perks isn't merely about extravagant vacations; it's a strategic way to attract and retain talent in a competitive job market.\n\nIn a post-pandemic era where work-life balance is paramount, companies are redefining perks by offering generous travel incentives. Travel-related companies spearheaded this trend, with Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) granting employees $2,000 in annual travel credits, while Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) reimburses travel expenses between $1,250 to $1,750. Now, different industries are following suit, with companies like Calendly providing a $1,000 vacation stipend and Bamboo HR offering a $2,000 annual travel allowance.\n\nAirbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) has established itself as a pioneer in supporting its workforce with strong paid leave policies. Recognized by the National Partnership for Women and Families in 2021, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB)\u2019s innovative approach to bereavement leave, offering paid time off for employees mourning the loss of a close family member, highlights its commitment to employee well-being. With a range of paid leave options available, including parental leave of up to 10 weeks, medical leave for birth parents of up to 12 weeks, and caregiver leave offering up to 6 weeks of paid time off, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) ensures that employees can prioritize their familial responsibilities without financial strain.\n\nThrough initiatives like phased return to work, providing a 12-week transition period for new parents to work at 80% capacity while receiving full pay, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) empowers employees to balance their professional and personal lives effectively. These policies not only enhance employee morale and satisfaction but also contribute to improved productivity and retention rates within the company.\n\nHowever, despite Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB)\u2019s proactive stance on paid leave, the absence of a national policy in the US highlights broader challenges facing workers nationwide.\n\nOn the other hand, apart from paid leave, staff members at Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) also enjoy exclusive discounts on the platform and receive travel bonuses for successful referrals. Moreover, many employees at Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE)\u00a0 qualify for an IATAN card, granting them professional travel credentials that unlock a plethora of perks including special incentives from airlines, hotels, cruise lines, car rental services, and tourist attractions. 30 Countries With Most Paid Vacation Days Per Year\n\nKamira/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the countries with the most paid vacation days per year, we 50 identified countries with the most public holidays in the world. Then, out of those 50, 30 with the highest number of total paid vacations, including weekends, were shortlisted, and have been listed below in an ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "This article looks at the 20 cheapest Asian countries that you can travel to affordably. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Tourism in Asia, you may skip ahead to 5 Cheapest Asian Countries That You Can Travel To Affordably.\n\nUnless you\u2019re that one in a million person, it\u2019s extremely likely that you\u2019ve spent plenty of nights rolling over in bed, swiping your thumb away as you watch reel after reel of various influencers as they share montages of their latest vacation. If so, you\u2019re definitely not alone. The sad truth is that in a world where some people spend half the year frolicking along the shores of Ibiza, there are those whose desire to wander is squashed by the thought of high travel costs.\n\nHowever, an important reason for this perception is that when people think of tourism, their mind races to the bustling streets of New Orleans, or the serene beaches of the Bahamas, or the majestic landscapes of the Swiss Alps. While we look to flock towards these bougie hotspots, there lies a treasure trove of countries that remain in the shadows, ready to offer the same cultural charm and scenic beauty for a fraction of the cost. If you\u2019re looking for a vacation where the thrill of adventure isn\u2019t eclipsed by financial strains, join us as we reveal the 20 cheapest Asian countries that you can travel to affordably.\n\nTourism in Asia\n\nUnlike other regions in the world, tourism in Asia-Pacific has not managed to rejuvenate to pre-COVID levels. UNWTO reported that while global tourism reached 88% of pre-COVID levels in 2023, the Asia-Pacific region attained only 65% of its 2019 tourist arrivals last year. In comparison, the neighboring countries of Middle East reached 122% of pre-COVID levels, becoming the first region to surpass pre-COVID tourist arrivals.\n\nThese numbers might force you to think that the continent lacks the appeal or the infrastructure to provide a worthy vacation experience, however, this is far from the truth. Asia is home to a vast tapestry of unseen tourist destinations, and it is about time that tourists turn their attention towards these underrated gems.\n\nStory continues\n\nDepending on the location you travel to, destinations in Asia can provide both luxury and budget-friendly itineraries. Companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) and Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR) are rigorously expanding their footprint in Asia in anticipation of an increase in tourist activity. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) recently announced that it will be opening 25 luxury hotels across the Asia-Pacific in the next few years, targeting countries such as Malaysia, India, and Vietnam. Recently, the company launched Conrad Singapore Orchard, its second hotel in the country.\n\n\u201cThe growth of our Conrad Hotels & Resorts brand reflects our commitment to expanding our luxury portfolio in inspiring destinations around the region.\u201d\n\n-Alan Watts, President, Asia Pacific, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT)\n\nSimilarly, Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR) closed 2023 with 560 hotels in the Asia Pacific region. The company\u2019s president for its APEC portfolio commented on this achievement:\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to meeting the demands of modern travelers underscored by our diverse portfolio of brands and strategic presence in new destinations.\u201d\n\n-Rajeev Menon, President APEC, Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR)\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, companies focusing on budget friendly trips, such as Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB), are also reporting positive signs from the region. Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) revealed that Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore were among the top 5 countries with the highest increase in searches on Airbnb when comparing Q1 \u2013 Q3 2023 to Q1 \u2013 Q3 2024. Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) also revealed that 4000 new cities welcomed their first Airbnb stays in 2023, highlighting how tourism is dispersing towards previously neglected destinations. 20 Cheapest Asian Countries That You Can Travel To Affordably\n\n20 Cheapest Asian Countries That You Can Travel To Affordably\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of 20 cheapest Asian countries that you can travel to affordably we traversed through similarly recommended lists on the web to develop a shortlist of budget friendly countries. For these countries, we used Google Flights to obtain data on the cheapest available flight from the US (using JFK as the reference point for departures) for 2 adults. Moreover, we used Budgetyourtrip and whereandwhen to obtain the average amount required to spend a week-long couple\u2019s vacation in each country. Accumulating these data points allowed us to calculate the total expected amount required on a trip to each country. Each country was ranked in ascending order with respect to this metric, and the first 20 countries were selected as the cheapest Asian countries that you can travel to affordably.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

China\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2194\n\nAverage expense during stay: $1008\n\nTotal cost (for two): $3202\n\nRecovery of tourism in China has been even more sluggish than the rest of the region. The number of foreign entries (business, leisure, or personal affairs) to China in 2023 were still around a third of the figures recorded in 2019. Consequently, a lack of demand coupled with the fact that the country has many historical monuments, majestic country sides, and bustling metropolises means that it is one of the cheapest Asian countries to visit.\n\n19. Laos\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2572\n\nAverage expense during stay: $588\n\nTotal cost (for two): $3160\n\nIn terms of expenses during the trip, Laos is one of the cheapest countries in our list. Located in Southeast Asia, it is renowned for its incredible riverscape and Buddhist heritage sites. Moreover, several ports offer 30-day tourist visas to US citizens on arrival, making the process of entry quite convenient. The city of Luang Prabang was recently featured in our list of 20 Most Underrated Travel Destinations in Asiaand is the perfect location for an exotic vacation if you aren\u2019t fixated on travelling to a beachside destination.\n\n18. Bhutan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2095\n\nAverage expense during stay: $1008\n\nTotal cost (for two): $3103\n\nBhutan is an outrageously underrated Himalayan Kingdom isolated between the vast nations of India and China. Known as \u201cThe Last Shangri-la\u201d, its history is both mysterious and fascinating. The government of Bhutan has adopted a policy of \u201cHigh Value, Low Impact\u201d which aims at preserving the country\u2019s resources and attractions by restricting the volume of tourist arrivals each year. This means that visas can be difficult to procure. However, it remains one of the cheapest Asian countries that you can travel to affordably.\n\n17. Kyrgyzstan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2078\n\nAverage expense during stay: $954\n\nTotal cost (for two): $3032\n\nKyrgyzstan is the perfect recluse for an authentic cultural experience. The country\u2019s landscape mostly comprises of a rugged mountainous terrain wherein you can find plenty of opportunities for trekking, skiing, and sightseeing. Many tourists who visit the country are taken away by the nomadic and pastoral lifestyle of a vast population. Moreover, the capital city of Bishkek contains museums, an opera house, and several Soviet-Asian monuments that flaunt the cultural legacy of the nation.\n\n16. Tajikistan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2233\n\nAverage expense during stay: $763\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2996\n\nThe land locked and sparsely populated country of Tajikistan is home to breathtaking mountainous landscapes, with some peaks rising as high as 7000 meters. It also houses the second highest highway in the world, Pamir Highway, which makes for a spectacular road trip. Moreover, the ancient settlement of Sarazm dates back over 5 millennia and is believed to be one of the first proto-urban territories in Central Asia. Whilst increased caution should be taken to avoid the eastern regions of Wakhan Corridor and the Gorno-Badakhshon Autonomous Province, Tajikistan is one of the cheapest Asian countries that you can travel to affordably.\n\n15. Taiwan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1914\n\nAverage expense during stay: $1030\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2944\n\nThe island nation of Taiwan is both affordable and offers an immensely diverse range of activities. From serene mountains to pristine beaches, the country features all the essentials of an adventurous retreat. Moreover, it offers the chance to interact with the spiritual and cultural roots of the region with its vibrant night markets and spiritual monasteries.\n\n14. Kazakhstan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1864\n\nAverage expense during stay: $1015\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2879\n\nIn comparison to other landlocked states in central Asia, Kazakhstan offers both natural and modern attractions. Its capital city of Astana features some of the most unique incredible architectural sites, including mosques, skyscrapers, and the world famous Baiterek monument. Despite having blossomed into such a beautiful and successful destination, the country is still one of the cheapest Asian countries you can travel to affordably.\n\n13. Mongolia\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2099\n\nAverage expense during stay: $771\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2870\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reclusive holiday, why not visit one of the least densely populated countries in the world. Mongolia offers a chance for you to part from the fuss and feathers of everyday life and immerse among the nomadic population. Its blend of tranquility and tradition is the perfect cocktail for introspection and inspiration.\n\n12. Nepal\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2059\n\nAverage expense during stay: $687\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2746\n\nTourism in Nepal isn\u2019t just confined to summitting Mount Everest. Unfortunately, the world\u2019s tallest peak literally and metaphorically casts a shadow on Nepal\u2019s incredible portfolio of tourist-centric activities. Nepal is home to 6000 rivers, 15 national parks and 8 of the 14 tallest peaks on the planet. Major tourist activities include kayaking, bungee jumping, paragliding, and birdwatching. Moreover, being the birth place of Buddha and hearth and home to several ancient Hindu temples means that there is plenty of history and culture to unravel in a trip to Nepal.\n\n11. Sri Lanka\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $2003\n\nAverage expense during stay: $733\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2736\n\nJust 20 miles to the south of India, the island of Sri Lanka is home to a myriad of ancient cities and monasteries. The island\u2019s documented history dates back to the Kingdom of Tambapanni in 6th century BCE, and the land has ever since been witness to a nexus of wars, incursions, and invasions. Consequently, there are many colonial, spiritual, and medieval landmarks present throughout the region, some dating as far back as 125,000 years to the Paleolithic settlements of Balangoda. Even though the country\u2019s economy and currency is on track to recover from the economic crisis of 2022, it is still one of the cheapest Asian countries you can travel to affordably.\n\n10. Cambodia\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1972\n\nAverage expense during stay: $748\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2720\n\nCambodia\u2019s main attractions are its various stone complexes, a stunning feat of architecture dating back to the Middle Ages. Angkor Wat, the largest religious complex in the world, is often referred to as the 8th wonder of the world. Moreover, the ruins of the temple of Ta Prohm, now enveloped behind centuries of overgrown jungles, are another prominent destination among tourists. On the other hand, Cambodia is also blessed with some of Asia\u2019s most spectacular beachscapes, making it just as ideal for an oceanside vacation as it is for a cultural tour.\n\n9. Azerbaijan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1695\n\nAverage expense during stay: $908\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2603\n\nThe transcontinental country of Azerbaijan embodies a vibrant tapestry of ancient and modern cultures. Famous for its cuisine, night life, and craft markets, the capital city of Baku is one of the best destinations for any tourist to enjoy an exotic vacation. Moreover, the rural areas of the country offer diverse landscapes, from lofty peaks and mud volcanoes to the shores of the Caspian Sea. That said, the eastern borders of the country are subject to continuous armed conflicts and skirmishes against Armenian forces, necessitating a high level of precaution.\n\n8. Uzbekistan\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1733\n\nAverage expense during stay: $847\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2580\n\nUzbekistan is the cheapest Central Asian country on our list. The country\u2019s history is heavily inspired by both Islamic and Soviet influence, which is visible in the bold architecture of its many mosques, madrassas, and museum. Uzbekistan has a lively arts scene, as the country is famous for its ceramic and crafts, in addition to Savitsky Museum\u2019s vast collection of Soviet era art. The region of Khorezm was once part of the famous Silk Road, and remnants of desert castles in this area are visited by tourists to this day.\n\n7. Malaysia\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1838\n\nAverage expense during stay: $611\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2449\n\nIn comparison to the likes of Indonesia and Japan, Malaysia offers far more avenues for a budget friendly vacation. Kuala Lumpur is one of the most developed cities in the whole of Asia and features iconic sites such as the Petronas Twin Towers and the Menara. Malaysia is famous for its cultural heritage, as it is home to landmarks from Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and colonial periods. Furthermore, the nation has been bestowed with an abundance of beaches and rain-forests. Because of all these options, tourists can easily customize their itinerary to their taste and spending power, making it one of the cheapest Asian countries you can travel to affordably.\n\n6. Thailand\n\nCheapest Return Ticket: $1745\n\nAverage expense during stay: $687\n\nTotal cost (for two): $2432\n\nThere is simply no limit to the number of excursions you can choose from in a trip to Thailand. While places such as Bangkok and Phuket are not as economical as the other regions of the country, the beauty of Thailand is that every sunset gold beach has a perfect, budget friendly substitute. Therefore, travelers can easily find budget friendly destinations, activities, and accommodations. Another important factor is that Thailand\u2019s cuisine is extremely affordable and can be savored by simply visiting street stalls and seaside counters. Overall, Thailand invites travelers to immerse themselves in its rich cultural heritage and natural beauty, whilst also being one of the cheapest Asian countries you can travel to affordably.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Cheapest Asian Countries That You Can Travel To Affordably.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Highest Quality Scotch Whisky Brands in the World 15 States With the Most Beautiful Beaches in the US 20 Most Humid Cities in the World\n\nDisclosure: none.\u00a020 Cheapest Asian Countries That You Can Travel To Affordably is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAirbnb's estimated fair value is US$209 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$162 suggests Airbnb is potentially 23% undervalued Analyst price target for ABNB is US$147 which is 30% below our fair value estimate\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Airbnb\n\nThe Model\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$4.04b US$4.62b US$5.13b US$5.87b US$6.69b US$7.30b US$7.82b US$8.26b US$8.64b US$8.98b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x11 Analyst x12 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 9.11% Est @ 7.07% Est @ 5.63% Est @ 4.63% Est @ 3.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4%  US$3.8k US$4.0k US$4.1k US$4.4k US$4.7k US$4.8k US$4.8k US$4.7k US$4.6k US$4.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$44b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$9.0b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.3%) = US$181b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$181b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$89b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$133b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$162, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Airbnb as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.102. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Airbnb\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for ABNB.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "content": "In this article, we shall discuss the 25 most amazing countries in Asia. To skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry in 2024, go directly and see 10 Most Amazing Countries in Asia.\n\nTravel Industry Outlook: Key Trends\n\nThe global travel industry has always managed to stay afloat, even in times of immense financial anxiety and turbulence. This has partly been due to an increased enthusiasm for in-destination activities, peaking interest in more diverse destinations like some of the most amazing countries in Asia, and the influx of baby boomers in great numbers into the travel market. However, despite this historically optimistic outlook, the impending economic downturn is slated to massively impact sentiments around tourism across the globe. The report projects that the frequency and optimism around travel may see a consistent decline; however, if higher-income groups remain insulated from economic headwinds in 2024, higher-end travel products could post better returns than budget products. In the corporate arena, the report posits that key stakeholders will aspire to an intricate balance between conservative budgeting and strategic tailwinds.\n\nAccording to a report by Deloitte, top players in the travel industry like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) are likely to be influenced by three key trends in 2024, the first of them being the fact that skyrocketing interest rates and increased costs of certain goods have made it more difficult for hotel companies to upgrade hotels. Airlines have also been negatively impacted by unforeseen weather conditions and staffing concerns. Hence, top airlines and hospitality providers are diverting greater investments into improving consumer experience in fear of losing out on tourists' attention. To read more on how hospitality providers are navigating the current macroeconomic currents, check out our coverage of the 25 Most Luxurious Hotels in the World. Secondly, although the return of corporate travel is not going anywhere for the foreseeable future, gains are on a steady decline. Companies still feel that travel to build relationships with clients and support team collaborations are integral to the holistic success of any business endeavor, the rising costs of travel can no longer be shrugged off. Despite these concerns, US corporate travel spending is still projected to exceed pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024. Lastly, generative AI is a huge influencer with respect to travel. The most widely reported benefit of gen AI remains with respect to call-centers and customer support. In 2024, gen AI is expected to impact the global travel industry in unprecedented ways. From advertising strategies to marketing personalization, gen AI is widely perceived to be the future of travel, especially in some of the most amazing countries in Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nTravel in the Digital Age: An Analysis\n\nAs the world shifts towards digitally-enabled travel, innovations and advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and AR/VR are reinvigorating tourism as we know it. These advances in technology have also brought about enormous shifts in customer expectations, causing major players in the travel industry like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) to rethink and revaluate their engagement with consumers, development of new products and services, and management of day-to-day operations in some of the most amazing countries in Asia. According to a report by McKinsey, the average time spent on digital devices has skyrocketed by more than 70% since 2013, with the trend accelerating during the 2019-21 time period when online interactions replaced person-to-person contact during the heyday of the pandemic. With traditional travel still being primarily a human-centric enterprise, major travel companies have a golden opportunity to capitalize upon the global digital transition in a bid to redefine travel in the internet age.\n\nOne of the primary ways this can be achieved is to effectively accumulate, process, and interpret the vast amounts of consumer data which is now available to travel companies, with newer technologies like AI-powered assistants only exacerbating this trend. However, it is true that oft times, consumer data can get incredibly complicated to process and does not always paint an accurate portrait of the consumer and his/her preferences. In an effort to optimize interpretation of consumer data, companies have started to acquire the services of third-party sources in order to attain a more holistic understanding by distilling commercial, operation, financial and behavioral inputs. Furthermore, companies are also diverting greater investments into creating consumer segments to guide their engagement with different kinds of consumers in many of the most amazing countries in Asia. This segmentation tends to rely on the analytics capacity in hand and can range from segmentation based on single macro characteristics to hyper-segmentation. Hyper-personalization is also an excellent alternative for companies to rebuild trust in case of operational inefficiencies. Personalized communication tends to reassure the consumer that their preferences are at the very top of the company's agenda and that an effective recovery plan is in the works to best address their concerns. For instance, some companies tend to share real-time status updates during service disruptions or provide personalized prescriptions to the consumers' complaints, or may even undertake proactive compensation to ensure that customers feel that they are in good hands.

Most Amazing Countries in Asia\n\nPhoto by Hilmi Can Ta\u015fk\u0131ran on Unsplash\n\nTravel in Asian Economies: An Overview\n\nTravel and tourism is a significant contributor to employment and growth in Asian economies, with a burgeoning middle-class, swift visa approvals, and enhanced digital connectivity leading to the market accounting for more than 9.8% of the regions GDP as of 2023. In countries like Cambodia, Thailand, and the Philippines, travel tends to account for more than 20% of the state economy. The industry suffered enormous setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, with local travelers preferring domestic travel options. However, successful containment of the pandemic and vaccine proliferation in some of the most amazing countries in Asia has led to a strong rebound, with major players like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) investing in enhancing their footprints in the region.\n\nAs the region's travel sector posts strong growth with demands of outbound flights set to meet pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024, experts are predicting that the Chinese boom will soon supplement this growth in times to come. According to a report by CNBC, the region's travel demand skyrocketed to 83% of pre-pandemic levels as of December 2023, with Chinese tourists ramping up visits to the Southeast-Asian belts within the wider region. According to a report by Citigroup, the US, UK South Korea, Japan and Australia are slated to be some of the most popular holiday destinations of Chinese tourists in 2024. They are also likely to visit some of the most amazing countries in Asia like Thailand, which welcomed more the highest number of Chinese tourists in 2023. Singapore follows close behind, with the number of flights booked from China surging more than six times in 2023.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 25 most amazing countries in Asia, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We then shortlisted more than 40 countries which appeared most frequently during our research. Since how amazing a particular country is is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria; the criteria is premised on each country's natural beauty (20 points), cultural heritage (15 points), and safety (10 points). We then proceeded to award each country a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 25 countries which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the natural beauty of the respective country.\n\nTo sum it up, we ranked the 25 most amazing countries in Asia using a consensus methodology. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

If you want to skip our discussion about the travel industry and adventure travel, go to 5 US Bucket List Trips In 2024 For Adventure Lovers.\n\nThe global tourism industry is rebounding. It already reached 90% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and is expected to surpass it this year, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. The United States has been leading this comeback of the global tourism industry, with the travel and tourism sector contributing $2.6 trillion to the economic footprint of the country in the year 2022. The US Travel Association also reports that the United States had reached 84% of 2019 visitation levels by December 2023.\n\nIn our piece about the best cheap summer vacation destinations in the US, we saw how an increasing number of Americans expressed a desire to travel in the summer months. Most travelers prefer domestic travel due to rising international travel costs. Summer travels often entail adventure vacations, which we are going to look at later in this article.\n\nThe United States offers diverse vacation experiences, including those for adventure lovers. The country has a plethora of hiking trails, national parks, waterfalls, and mountains for those who love to seek adventure. Adventure tourism is a large segment of the overall tourism market. The people in this segment seek outdoor activities and natural experiences. According to Allied Market Research, the global adventure tourism market size was estimated to be valued at $324 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2032, growing at a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5%. Adventure travel in the United States alone is quite significant. It contributes $887 billion annually to the US economy, with millions of Americans participating in outdoor activities each year.\n\nThe United States, although one of the most adventurous places in the world, does not top the list of adventurous countries. Many experts and adventure enthusiasts agree that New Zealand is the most adventurous place in the world. According to a survey conducted by Booking.com, New Zealand consistently ranks as the top destination for adventure tourism. Adventure tourism also contributes significantly to the economy of the country, with activities like bungee jumping, skydiving, and extreme sports.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the US is not the most adventurous place in the world, it ranks pretty high on the list. The variety of travel experiences within the United States combined with the rising cost of travel makes domestic vacation an attractive option for American travelers. This is one of the reasons why, despite the rising costs of everyday lives, Americans are spending a substantial amount on travel. In 2022, the total travel spending in the country reached $1.2 trillion as travelers started looking to travel smarter, exploring hidden gems, and opting for cheaper alternatives.\n\nWhile the global travel and tourism industry is rebounding, the pace has been slower than expected amid inflation and rising travel costs. Companies, such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), which are associated with the travel and tourism industry suffered slightly because of inflation. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a leading short-term rental company that faced significant shifts in the year 2023. People were starting to wonder whether the company was on its way to dying out after a report published in Bloomberg reported available revenue per room in areas of Orlando and California dropped by 6.4% and 17%, respectively, in the first half of 2023. However, the company recently reported a positive revenue surprise for the fourth quarter of 2023, which depicts that Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and the travel industry are on the rise. The company reported a revenue of $2.22 billion and outperformed market expectations by $53.47 million.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 15 US bucket list trips in 2024 for adventure lovers.  15 US Bucket List Trips In 2024 For Adventure Lovers\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 15 best bucket list trips in 2024 for adventure lovers, we looked at 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources on the internet. We used a consensus methodology in which we gave the highest priority to the number of times each adventure destination appeared on our sources (frequency). However, we also wanted to account for the ranking of each destination in our sources while giving each an equal weightage. So, we used our previously devised ranking factor and added it to the frequency to arrive at the Insider Monkey Score. The higher this score, the higher the destination ranks on our list. We used the following calculation for our ranking factor: (15/sum of rankings*100). The ranking factor is devised in a way that it is always greater than zero but less than one. So, if source A has an Insider Monkey Score of 3.25, 3 is its frequency and 0.25 is the ranking factor.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "3 Surprise AI Stocks Headed for a $1 Trillion Market Cap",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformational technology. Because of AI, some established businesses will develop additional sources of revenue, and others will struggle to find a place in the new business and tech environment.\n\nStill, other companies, often not thought of as AI stocks, could experience rapid growth and possibly emerge out of nowhere to grow to a market cap of $1 trillion and beyond. Although it's difficult to accurately predict which growth stocks will achieve such a milestone, three Motley Fool contributors have ideas on which of these less obvious AI stocks can grow their market cap beyond $1 trillion.\n\nAn old-school tech stock profits from the AI revolution\n\nJake Lerch (Oracle): My pick is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), thanks to its resurgent cloud business\u00a0that's being fueled by skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence data servers.\n\nOn the company's most recent earnings call (for the three months ending on Feb. 29), Oracle chairman Larry Ellison was very straightforward in admitting that Microsoft's explosive cloud growth is driving knock-on success for Microsoft's suppliers, including Oracle. \"We're building 20 data centers [for] Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter,\" Ellison said.\n\nIn turn, Oracle's overall revenue rose 7% year over year in its most recent quarter to $13.3 billion. Better yet, management gave upbeat guidance, indicating that future sales goals may be met earlier than expected, as the company's cloud services segment is growing at a 25% year-over-year rate.\n\nAs for the company's stock, it might be a surprise that Oracle is already America's 20th-largest company with a market cap of $345 billion, making it more than twice the size of iconic companies like Verizon, Caterpillar, and AmericanExpress.\n\nWhat is perhaps more shocking, particularly to those of us who lived through the stock's utter collapse in the wake of the dot-com bubble, Oracle has actually been a solid investment for more than a decade. In fact, Oracle's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade.\n\nStory continues ORCL Total Return Level Chart\n\nSo, it might be time for investors to give Oracle another look. Thanks to its red-hot cloud business, this Web 1.0 name could be on the fast track to a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nTSMC doesn't get the credit it deserves\n\nJustin Pope (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Semiconductors have become the building blocks of AI; the chips power the massive computers needed to crunch the data to train AI models. Nvidia, the current king of AI chips with most of the market share, is doing just over $60 billion in companywide sales annually. CEO Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's rival, believes the AI chip market will grow as large as $400 billion over the coming years.\n\nDespite being well-known chip giants, neither Nvidia nor AMD actually manufacture their chips. That job belongs to manufacturing specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, with an estimated 56% share of the world's chip production. As the market leader, you can be sure that TSMC is the go-to for these new, highly advanced chips powering the latest innovations like AI.\n\nThe market isn't exactly sleeping on TSMC stock. After all, the company is worth over $600 billion today. However, it's still reasonably priced at 23 times analysts' estimated 2024 earnings of $6.17 per share.\n\nThink about it. If semiconductor demand pushes the AI chip market to such massive growth (several times its current size if Lisa Su is correct), much of that business will trickle down to TSMC. It's not a stretch to see the company's earnings doubling over the next decade, which would be more than enough to push TSMC past a trillion-dollar market cap.\n\nThe future looks bright for the world's leading chip fab, and a trillion-dollar valuation seems more like a matter of when not if.\n\nThis travel stock should continue to book AI-driven gains\n\nWill Healy(Airbnb): Most consumers see Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) as a tourism company, and understandably so. It has turned the vacation rental industry on its head, changing any residence into a potential vacation property. Moreover, it has reinforced this reputation by offering activities that might appeal to vacationers.\n\nNonetheless, it would likely surprise many customers and even some investors to know that Airbnb probably owes its success to AI. For one, it's not a first mover in this space. That claim belongs to Expedia's Vrbo. Furthermore, unlike a hotel chain like Hilton, it doesn't own the properties it helps lease.\n\nIn reality, Airbnb is little more than a website for listings with a high level of name recognition. The company fosters its competitive advantages through AI. The technology helps with challenges such as determining proper pricing levels in a given area or estimating the reputations of prospective tenants.\n\nAirbnb has also found unusual applications for AI. The technology plays a role in enforcing holiday activity restrictions and estimating the likelihood a tenant might violate such rules.\n\nAlso, Airbnb has begun testing its AI chatbot to handle many customer support inquiries. To this end, it recently bought GamePlanner, a company that can presumably make AI experiences on Airbnb seem more human.\n\nMoreover, the company might be closer to a $1 trillion market cap than some might assume. Thanks to its 7.7 million listings and 448 million nights and experiences booked in just the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, the stock has already grown to a market cap of $105 billion -- meaning it has to double roughly 3.2 times to take the market cap to $1 trillion.\n\nAdmittedly, such a feat will likely take a few years since the market cap will still have to grow by almost ninefold to achieve that milestone. Also, Airbnb's P/E ratio of 23 was skewed lower by a one-time income tax benefit, making its true earnings-based valuation higher than it might appear.\n\nHowever, its price-to-sales ratio of 11 is not far from record lows, a factor that should serve as a catalyst as revenue and earnings rise further. With AI continuing to increase the company's productivity, the $1 trillion market cap should eventually be within reach.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Turbulence Ahead? 3 Travel Stocks to Scrutinize After the Expedia Layoffs",
        "content": "The travel industry has been in a post-pandemic boom, but the wind may be going out of its sails. Online travel agent (OTA) Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) surprised the market by announcing it was firing 1,500 employees, or 9% of its workforce, because of sagging demand. The cuts will hit its bottom line by $80 million to $100 million.\n\nIt\u2019s not alone. Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) also said to expect a slower first-quarter result as well as weaker full-year financials. Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) pretty much said the same thing.\n\nAirline fares are still falling as consumers prioritize their travel plans, but high costs and repeated mechanical failures at Boeing (NYSE:BA) could dampen demand further. With doors popping off planes, landing gear breaking off and reports the plane manufacturer is failing numerous safety checks, travelers just might decide to choose some other form of transportation. The \u201cstaycation\u201d could even make a comeback.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf demand is slowing so much, investors may want to use caution when buying travel stocks. Here are three companies to scrutinize in the wake of Expedia\u2019s layoffs.\n\nCarnival (CCL) cruise stocks docked cruise ships. CCL stock.\n\nSource: Kokoulina / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest cruise ship operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL, NYSE:CUK) has failed to recover its former heights before the pandemic hit. The government forced the cruise industry to remain drydocked longer than just about any other industry. It cost the cruise liner owners billions of dollars that they have yet to make up. Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) finds itself in much the same situation. Shares of both companies remain between 65% and 70% below the levels they traded at pre-pandemic.\n\nOnly Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) is running full steam ahead. RCL stock trades about 15% above where it was before the global health crisis. RCL stock is also just below its all-time high hit right before the crash.\n\nMake no mistake, Carnival has rebounded sharply from the depths it sunk to during the pandemic. CCL stock is up 76% over the past year. But the cruise line operator still faces rough seas. Although it paid down large swaths of debt it acquired during the health crisis, it still has $28.5 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet. There is only $2.4 billion in cash, with another $5 billion in liquidity available to it.\n\nStory continues\n\nCarnival\u2019s saving grace is that cruise demand remains relatively strong. Booking volumes are at record highs, and customer deposits of $6.4 billion are a record. The cruise ship owner will not sink, but spiking inflation won\u2019t help. If a recession hits, CCL stock could get hit by a rogue wave.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike much of the cruise industry, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is doing much better than it was at the onset of the pandemic but has still failed to gain much altitude. UAL stock remains about 43% below pre-COVID levels. Boeing\u2019s woes are not going to help.\n\nThe industry has been constrained by shortages of planes and pilots and a lack of capacity to meet post-pandemic demand. However, airlines were able to record profits that might soon end if travel demand weakens further. Slowing plane deliveries from Boeing will cause airlines to cut costs, meaning hiring plans will get put on hold. United posted a $600 million GAAP net profit last quarter, a 28% decline from last year. It also has nearly $30 billion in long-term debt and operating leases. High interest rates, elevated jet fuel prices and high labor costs will all weigh on the airline.\n\nWarren Buffett famously critiqued the industry as a unique business that destroys capital.\n\n\u201cBut seriously, the airline business has been extraordinary. It has eaten up capital over the past century like almost no other business because people seem to keep coming back to it and putting fresh money in.\u201d\n\nHe broke his vow to not invest in airlines a few years ago, including United, only to quickly retreat and sell off his entire stake. The structural inadequacies of the industry don\u2019t make it a good one to invest in, at least if you\u2019re a buy-and-hold investor.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne travel stock showing surprising strength amid a declining market is short-term vacation rental outfit Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). The stock is up 22% year-to-date and over 38% higher than it was a year ago.\n\nAlthough growth is slowing, it is still increasing at double-digit rates. Revenue grew 17% last year when adjusted for currency fluctuations, while profits more than doubled to almost $5 billion. Gross booking values were up 16% to $73 billion, and nights and experiences booked grew 14% to over 448 million.\n\nBy serving both hosts and travelers it benefits by offering the widest possible selection of options. Its global presence attracts the largest audience to meet any budget or need. It means Airbnb doesn\u2019t have to be affected by a worldwide slowdown in travel demand, as guests can choose getaways closer to home at price points they can afford.\n\nIt\u2019s like why ABNB stock is only about 20% below the all-time high it hit in early 2021. Management expects business to continue growing this year. Because Airbnb has proven adept at generating free cash flow, it has sufficient cushion to cover any temporary downturns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Learn how these stocks may redefine investment returns with a projected 400% leap in the next two years.\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nHims & Hers (NYSE:HIMS) has attained considerable subscriber growth. This can be observed in the increase in its subscriber base, representing a 48% YoY growth. This substantial expansion in subscribers suggests the company\u2019s fundamental capability to attract and retain customers, boosting its market reach and top-line potential.\n\nAdditionally, the trend of subscriber growth points out Hims & Hers\u2019 lead in scaling its platform and increasing its user base over time. The YoY boost indicates a solid demand for the company\u2019s offerings. This is also based on solid marketing strategies, personalized offerings, and positive subscriber experiences.\n\nMoreover, the constant quarterly growth in subscribers throughout 2023 signals the edge of the company\u2019s subscriber expansion efforts. By steadily increasing its subscriber base each quarter, Hims & Hers signifies its fundamental capability to sustain momentum and derive long-term value growth through an ending user community.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Hims & Hers has delivered an efficient operational edge, reflected in profitability and cost control metrics. The company\u2019s capability to manage its operations sharply leads to its consolidated performance. One main metric in this context is the gross margin, which hit\u00a082% in 2023 against 78% in 2022. This increase in gross margin reflects the company\u2019s capability to optimize its cost structure, improve product margins, and boost operational efficiency with time.\n\nLastly, another core indicator is adjusted EBITDA. This has reached\u00a0$49.5 million for 2023, up from a negative $15.8 million in 2022. This considerable improvement in adjusted EBITDA suggests Hims & Hers\u2019 ability to derive positive operating income and bottom line through disciplined costing and top-line growth strategies. Hence, these developments bring massive valuation potential to Hims & Hers.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB)\n\nAirbnb\u2019s (NASDAQ:ABNB) focus on mainstreaming hosting can be observed in the growth of its host community. The number hosts reached 5 million globally at the end of 2023. Additionally, the active listings exceeded 7.7 million, representing an 18% YoY increase. Expanding its accommodation inventory has made solid progress in Airbnb\u2019s efforts to attract and retain hosts.\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on perfecting its core service is reflected in introducing over 430 new features and upgrades in the past three years. Notably, a post-cancellations\u00a0YoY drop of 36% in Q4 2023 suggests reliability and customer experience improvements.\n\nFurthermore, Airbnb\u2019s focus on underpenetrated international markets\u2014Germany, Brazil and Korea\u2014supports its strategic shift towards expanding beyond its core business. The company\u2019s rollout of its playbook in new countries and regions reflects its sharp approach to expansion and diversification.\n\nThis tangible progress and achievement reinforce Airbnb\u2019s strategic priorities. In Q4 2023, Airbnb attained a solid top-line of\u00a0$2.2 billion, a considerable 70% YoY boost. This indicates the company\u2019s capability to sharply monetize its platform and capitalize on the growing demand for accommodations and experiences.\n\nDespite a net loss of $249 million, Airbnb attained an adjusted net income margin of 22%, excluding non-recurring tax items. Hence, this reflects the company\u2019s proficiency in managing costs and optimizing the bottom line.\u00a0Overall, Airbnb\u2019s solid top-line and bottom-line growth reflects its leading market position and capability to derive growth through its platform.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW)\n\nPalo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) leads in deriving adoption across its three platforms: network security, Prisma Cloud and Cortex. The company attained considerable milestones in Q2 2024. It includes constant growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) business. This is also a strong trend in multi-module adoption within Prisma Cloud.\n\nIn the network security business, Palo Alto Networks delivered continued progress in deriving ARR growth in its SASE business. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of 50% ARR growth. Additionally,\u00a0more than 30% of new SASE customers signed in Q2 were new to Palo Alto. This indicates the company\u2019s capability to win market share and expand its client base.\n\nPalo Alto has significantly invested in Prisma Cloud to acquire new customers. This has resulted in the highest new annual contract value (ACV) growth in five quarters. The company also has solid trends in multi-module adoption. Moreover, there is nearly 30% growth in customers using two or more modules and nearly 60% in customers using three or more modules.\n\nIn Cortex, Palo Alto continued to leverage its autonomous security operations platform (XSIAM), which is a catalyst for large transactions and growth across the business. XSIAM adoption saw considerable progress in Q2. Most deals were signed in a single quarter, and bookings exceeded $90 million.\n\nFinally, Palo Alto\u2019s platform adoption and cross-selling leads reflect its fundamental capability to deliver high-quality cybersecurity solutions to capture diverse market demand. Therefore, by expanding its offerings and capturing additional business from existing and new customers, the company may continue to derive top-line growth and solidify its valuation growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Will Start to Warm Up as Winter Wanes",
        "content": "With warmer days just around the corner, investors may want to look at some of the top stocks for Spring.\n\nFor example, college kids all over the U.S. are going on Spring Break. That\u2019s great news for airlines with the\u00a0Transportation Security Administration already seeing travel volumes 6% higher than year-earlier numbers.\n\nWe can even look at hotel stocks, like Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT), which push higher in the warmer months. Cruise lines, like Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL), typically do well, too. Warmer months are even great for companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) especially with guest demand still strong, according to a company letter to shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven\u00a0Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is attractive as we head into the warmer months. Granted, it\u2019s a $3,500 stock, but the latest pullback is an opportunity.\n\nBetter, according to Forbes.com,40% of respondents expect to travel even more than they did in 2023, which could fuel even more upside for Spring stocks. That being said,\u00a0investors may want to start buying these top stocks for Spring.\n\nCarnival (CCL)\n\nWith its latest pullback, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) looks interesting as one of the top stocks for Spring.\n\nFor one, according to\u00a0Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), about 35.7 million people are expected to cruise in 2024, up from 31.5 million in 2023. Two, most cruise lines are now booked solid for the next 12 months. Three, its competitors, such as Royal Caribbean just blew earnings out of the water. In fact, RCL posted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.25, which was far better than expectations for $1.14. It even issued a strong outlook.\n\nAll of which makes CCL even more attractive, as it nears earnings on Mar. 25.\n\nIn addition, analysts at Stifel just raised their price target on CCL to $26, with a buy rating. The firm noted that \u201crecent \u201cunjustified underperformance\u201d relative to peers has presented an attractive buying opportunity,\u201d\u00a0as quoted by TheFly.com.\n\nStory continues\n\nStifel also believes CCL could raise its full-year guidance when it releases earnings. All thanks to strong demand and pricing.\n\nWe also have to consider that its forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 15.3 isn\u2019t reflective of the company\u2019s improvements. CCL is also still trading at less than sales, too.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL)\n\nWe can also look at airline stocks, like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).\n\nAccording to the TSA, spring break travel volume is expected to topple 2023 numbers across the country.\u00a0As noted by MassLive.com, \u201cIn 2024, officers said there could be nearly 400,000 travelers coming through the airport during each week of spring break in March.\u201d\n\nAlso, according to\u00a0Hayley Berg, lead economist for the\u00a0booking platform Hopper,\u00a0noted by The New York Times, airfares will continue to rise into late spring, as travel heats back up.\n\nEven better, analysts are bullish on the airline sector, with a majority rating stocks, like DAL a buy.\u00a0Deutsche Bank, for example, rates Delta a buy, noting, \u201cthe more moderate available seat mile, or ASM, growth rate for 2024\u201d will have \u201cmore positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance.\u201d\n\nEven Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio just increased its stake in\u00a0DAL by 529,100 shares. Plus, with Delta, we can collect its current yield of about 1%.\n\nAmplify Travel Tech ETF (AWAY)\n\nOr, if you\u2019d prefer to diversify your Spring travel holdings at a lower cost, there\u2019s always an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the\u00a0Amplify Travel Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:AWAY).\n\nWith 31 holdings, and an expense ratio of 0.75%, the ETFtracks companies in the \u201ctravel technology business\u201d that use the Internet for travel services such as bookings, ride-sharing, price comparisons and travel advice.\n\nSome of its top holdings include\u00a0Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Airbnb, Booking Holdings, and Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM). What\u2019s nice about the AWAY ETF is that it\u2019s less than $20 a share. If I wanted to buy 100 shares, it would cost me about $2,000, which allows me to diversify with 31 travel stocks, including the $3,500 Booking Holdings stock.\n\nEven better,\u00a0according to Forbes.com, \u201cWhen asked how much they\u2019ll travel in 2024, 52% of consumers said they plan to travel the same amount as they did in 2023. Another 40% of respondents expect to travel even more. Younger generations are the most likely to travel more this year. Gen Z (56%) and Millennials (49%) report more travel on their agenda compared to only 39% of Gen X and 29% of Baby Boomers increasing travel amounts.\u201d\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top Trader\u201d Issues A.I.

        "title": "Airbnb Is Redefining Travel Economics",
        "content": "Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of those ultra-rare phenomenal growth stories that started as a little incubated startup in San Francisco and has now mushroomed into a powerful force in the holiday home rental industry.\n\nThe company has disrupted the travel industry, injecting an idea of a property-sharing economy, redefining multiples of spaces and, at the same time, generating money in hotels.\n\nHow does Airbnb make money?\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with ABNB.\n\nFounded in 2008 and headquartered in California, Airbnb is an online marketplace for travel bookings. The platform connects those with spaces to rent out and those looking for places to stay. Consequently, it has grown into a global powerhouse in the multibillion-dollar hospitality industry because of its ability to offer travelers alternative accommodations away from hotels.\n\nBy offering a platform that connects hosts and guests, the company is able to generate fees on any transaction that takes place. Most of its revenues come from the 14% fee it charges guests who reserve accommodations on the platform. In addition, it generates some revenue from hosts by imposing a 3% fee on the booking fee. Therefore, the company profits from both the hosts and guests.\n\nAirbnb's double-sided network means the more guests and hosts the company has on its platform, the more money it can make in booking fees. Its other revenue sources are experience, customer support and payment processing fees.\n\nAirbnb soars to new heights as global travel rebounds\n\nWith the opening of the global economy following the easing of Covid-19 travel restrictions, the company has bounced back to profitability amid booming business. As more people travel to various destinations around the globe, Airbnb continues to record booming business on its platform, translating to more transaction fees and, thus, revenue.\n\nIts revenue increased 18% to $9.90 billion in 2023, out of $73.30 billion in gross bookings. The company turned a profit of $4.80 billion in the year, representing a robust increase from $1.90 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the dip in 2020 that stemmed from the pandemic shutdowns that nearly destroyed the travel industry, revenue has been increasing consistently since 2018. Thus, the company's quick comeback to growth shows a resilient business model.\n\nApart from its strong revenue growth, Airbnb also maintains a solid balance sheet. The company exited 2023 with more than $10 billion in cash and short-term investments, and it has less than $2 billion in long-term debt.\n\nLastly, the company is using its cash prudently. In addition to investing the cash in the market and production expansion efforts, Airbnb is returning money to its investors through share repurchases.\n\nSince announcing its first repurchase program in 2022, Airbnb has returned $3.80 billion to investors. It recently added $6 billion to its share repurchase program. The company had $750 million under its previous plan at the end of 2023.\n\nMassive addressable market and expansion ffforts\n\nWhile it already pulls in considerable revenue, Airbnb sees more room to grow ahead. The company classifies its target markets into short-term stays, long-term stays and experiences.\n\nAcross these market segments, Airbnb estimates its addressable market opportunity to be $3.40 trillion. The short-term stay is the company's largest market segment, accounting for $1.80 trillion of the market opportunity.\n\nTherefore, the company has a $1.40 trillion opportunity in the experience market and a $210 billion opportunity in the long-term stays market. Airbnb Is Redefining Travel Economics\n\nThe experience market segment consists of activities that guests can participate in during their stays in a location. These include tours of the host's city and culture and activities like hiking in the local communities.\n\nWhile it has already built a significant footprint in North America, Airbnb still has a limited presence overseas. The company has embarked on an international expansion drive to fuel revenue growth.\n\nAirbnb is building a footprint in underpenetrated international markets like Germany, Brazil, Korea, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the international expansion drive, the company is focusing on brand awareness and localized services.\n\nHuge untapped opportunities for Airbnb still exist in regions like Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Airbnb Is Redefining Travel Economics\n\nExpanding and diversifying the business\n\nThe company is expanding both its geographic footprint and its service scope.\n\nGoing into more countries and deepening its presence in existing markets allows the company to expand its host community and increase rental choices and variety for its guests. These initiatives help the company stay competitive and maximize the addressable market opportunities.\n\nIn addition to widening its geographic market, Airbnb is also expanding its service scope. The experience market segment is particularly promising since it remains a less-explored opportunity with vast revenue potential.\n\nAs the company's host and guest communities grow, it can also build adjacent businesses around them. For example, payment processing and other financial services present a huge business opportunity for the company.\n\nMoreover, diversifying its services beyond home-sharinginto experiences, long-term accommodations, boutique hotels and transport serviceshas, according to Bailey Moran, transformed Airbnb into a multifaceted travel company.\n\nFinally, Airbnb has developed a great business model with an enormous market opportunity. Therefore, expanding into additional countries and launching additional services put the company in a great position to continue driving strong revenue growth.\n\nA leading market share in a competitive industry\n\nThough lucrative, the vacation rental market is fiercely competitive with many established participants.\n\nHowever, Airbnb has disrupted the scene and captured a substantial market share of 26%, being among the top three players in the market.\n\nThe company's double-sided networkhosts on one side and guests on the otheris a great advantage. For example, as the number of hosts increases on the platform, rental space options and variety increases for guests.\n\nTherefore, that incentivizes more guests to come to the platform, expanding the booking fee revenue opportunity for the company. Airbnb Is Redefining Travel Economics\n\nSource: enterpriseappstoday.com\n\nValuation\n\nAirbnb went public in 2020 for $68 a share and started trading at $146 after a 112% price gain. Three years down the line, the stock has underperformed despite taking over the accommodation sector on the back of significant innovations.\n\nThe stock has gained less than 10% over the past three years. The biggest beneficiaries have been investors who bought the stock before it started trading.\n\nAmid the underperformance, Airbnb looks undervalued while trading with a forward price-earnings multiple of 35 compared to the industry average, considering it is a growth stock. Its price-sales ratio of 11 is close to record lows at a time when the company is recording booming business, depicted by robust revenue growth.\n\nWhile trading for just $159 a share, Airbnb seems fairly valued, as per the GF Score. However, the booming travel outlook and the company's improving fundamentals with growth and profitability from 2021 with the opening of the global economy support a favorable outlook for the stock. Airbnb Is Redefining Travel Economics\n\nU.S. market dependence and rising hotel competition threaten growth\n\nOne of the biggest risk factors associated with Airbnb is its dependence on the U.S. market. The company has always relied on American consumers' high travel demand. While travel has climbed significantly since the pandemic, the high interest rates could affect the ability of most Americans to travel.\n\nWith most companies slashing spending to conserve cash as economic growth stalls out, American travelers are also following suit. U.S. consumers going slow on travel could significantly impact Airbnb's ability to generate money.\n\nOn the other hand, Airbnb is also staring at resurgent competition from hotels that are also finding ways to stay competitive in the hospitality industry. Thus, offering affordable accommodations could pose significant competition that could affect Airbnb travel volumes.\n\nBottom line\n\nAirbnb has maintained strong travel volumes above 2019 levels amid deteriorating economic conditions fuelled by runaway inflation. Likewise, the company remains well positioned for further growth in 2024 on the basis of improving consumer sentiment and economic conditions, supported by falling inflation and interest rates.\n\nThe company's growing market share and expansion into emerging markets, coupled with diversified offerings such as hotels and cruises, affirm its long-term prospects. The company has also started leveraging artificial intelligence to determine property pricing for photo arrangements that enhance the user experience and unlock new opportunities.\n\nFinally, Airbnb's unique approach, growing market share and client base and rising revenue affirm why the stock is a long-term play.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Tuesday, March 12, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+88.4% vs. +36.8%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus in the diabetes market and obesity drug Wegovy have been performing well fueled by increasing demand.\r\n\r\nLabel expansions of these drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by increasing its manufacturing capabilities. Wegovy is now indicated in the United States to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost. Studies on other pipeline candidates are also progressing well.\r\n\r\nAcquisitions to widen its portfolio are also encouraging. However, intense rivalry in the obesity sector threatens Novo Nordisk\u2019s market share. Patent expiry and pricing pressure across the diabetes market also remain a woe.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+1.9% vs. -6.8%). The company also cautioned that its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 is expected to be lower than 2023.\r\n\r\nThat said, production ramp-up at Gigafactory 4 and 5 and new models, including Cybertruck, are set to support long-term delivery growth. Importantly, the prospects of Tesla\u2019s Energy Storage business are encouraging. The company anticipates the growth rate of deployments and revenues in the Energy Storage business to surpass that of the Automotive business in 2024.\r\n\r\nRobust liquidity and the solid potential of its charging business are other positives. While shrinking margins remain a near-term concern, the Zacks analyst expects Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Airbnb have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Content industry over the past year (+40.6% vs. +35.2%). The company is benefiting from continuous improvements in Nights and Experiences Booked, enabling it to witness a positive trend in its Gross Booking Value. Growing gross nights booked, owing to solid momentum across high-density urban areas and first-time bookers is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nFurther, increasing guest demand and continuous recovery in cross-border travel are major positives. Strong momentum in active listings, owing to supply growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America, is benefiting the top line. Moreover, growing awareness around hosting and new features introduced for hosts is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, greater volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties, rising competition and impacts of geopolitical conflicts, remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Airbnb here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB), ONEOK, Inc. (OKE) and CDW Corp. (CDW).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Airbnb said Monday that it's banning the use of indoor security cameras in listings on its site around the world by the end of next month.\n\nThe San Francisco-based online rental platform said it is seeking to \u201csimplify\u201d its security-camera policy while prioritizing privacy.\n\n\u201cThese changes were made in consultation with our guests, Hosts and privacy experts, and we\u2019ll continue to seek feedback to help ensure our policies work for our global community,\" Juniper Downs, Airbnb\u2019s head of community policy and partnerships, said in a prepared statement.\n\nAirbnb had allowed the use of indoor security cameras in common areas, as long as the locations of the cameras were disclosed on the listings page. Under the new policy, hosts will still be allowed to use doorbell cameras and noise-decibel monitors, which are only allowed in common spaces, as long as the location and presence of the devices are disclosed.\n\nAirbnb expects the policy update to impact a small number of hosts because the majority of its listings do not report having indoor security cameras.\n\nThe policy change will take effect April 30.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, Airbnb said its bookings and revenue rose, and the company said demand remains strong.",

        "content": "Samantha Andrews, 49, has taken advantage of her big garden in her house in Cheshire by building a glamping pod - Lorne Campbell\n\nSamantha Andrews retired in 2017 aged 49, joining her husband to enjoy the fruits of decades in the workforce.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to retire on his own,\u201d she said, now 56. Not long after she quit her job as a manager of a college, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. \u201cThey were trialling younger people for a mammogram. I would never have known if I hadn\u2019t retired early.\u201d\n\nWhat ensued was a year of treatment followed by recovery. Ms Andrews and her husband have a big garden in their house in Cheshire, so they decided to build a glamping pod. Initially, Ms Andrews used it to recuperate in.\n\nBut before long, the two realised its business potential. Now, the pod \u2013 which is Hobbit-themed \u2013 turns over \u00a32,000 a month renting it out for half the year, from April to September.\n\nShe is one of a growing number of older homeowners who are turning to Airbnb in order to plug shortfalls in their retirement savings.\n\nNearly a third of Airbnb\u2019s UK-based hosts are retired, with those over 50 now making up 42pc of all hosts on its platform \u2013 up from 37pc five years ago.\n\nThe proportion of hosts over 60 has also increased over the same period, from 15pc to 19.2pc \u2013 and the holiday let portal also counts 7.5pc more retired hosts since 2019.\n\nThose in their late 40s and early 50s currently face an average savings shortfall of around \u00a3160,000 if they want to enjoy a \u201cmoderate\u201d retirement, according to insurer Phoenix.\n\nA \u201cmoderate\u201d annual retirement income in the UK was recently reclassified, with the goalposts now between \u00a331,300 and \u00a343,100 \u2013 depending on whether you\u2019re single or married. In addition to her AIrbnb income, Ms Andrews' teachers' pension is about \u00a35,000 a year ~ equal to around \u00a3100 per week - Lorne Campbell\n\nEven now that Ms Andrews can draw on her private pension, the supplementary income still feels essential. Her teachers\u2019 pension is about \u00a35,000 a year, equal to around \u00a3100 per week.\n\nThe Airbnb pays for her home and car insurance, Christmas, and the couple\u2019s oil-fuelled boiler. \u201cWithout it, it would be really tight. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do things in retirement. We have a motorhome which it pays for too, and that allows us to go away for a few weeks after summer is over.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a stream of income which will be mine in the future and gives me my independence.\u201d\n\nOlder homeowners have many available rooms to rent out in this way. More than four fifths of baby boomer households have spare bedrooms that are being left unused, according to Telegraph analysis of official data. The most recent census found that 84.1pc of households where the main resident is over 65 were considered \u201cunder-occupied\u201d.\n\nWhen Liz Matthews\u2019 son left for university in 2022, she started to let out his room, which has its own private entrance.\n\nThe 54-year-old freelance bookkeeper in South Devon, who earns \u00a332,000 a year, isn\u2019t sure when she will retire. After her divorce five years ago, she realised she needed to make sure her savings are ready for the future.\n\nShe now makes an extra \u00a310,000 each year from renting out the unused room. Living in Kingsbridge, the four-bedroom family home is 15 minutes from a lot of beaches and just half an hour away from Dartmoor. Liz Matthews makes an extra \u00a310,000 each year from renting out her son's unused room - Jay Williams\n\nMs Matthews said: \u201cA lot of my friends do the same here. One has a basement flat in her five-bedroom house. Hers is even busier than mine, but she\u2019s not working so she\u2019s got more time to do the changeover between bookings.\n\n\u201cThe extra income funds my holidays and the running of the house \u2013 but I am also trying to save as much as possible for retirement. The house is for a family, so I might as well make use of it.\u201d\n\nIn the next five to 10 years, Ms Matthews intends to downsize to a two-bedroom flat. But for now, she wants to keep the home her children grew up in so she can still host them and their families when they come to visit.\n\nThe Government\u2019s Rent a Room scheme allows homeowners to make up to \u00a37,500 in rental income before having to pay any tax on their earnings. For Ms Matthews, this means she pays 20pc tax on \u00a32,500 in earnings \u2013 equivalent to \u00a3500 each year.\n\nThe mother-of-two said: \u201cThe threshold makes it appealing too, because I don\u2019t have to pay too much in tax on my earnings.\u201d\n\nPatrick Thomson, of Phoenix, said that midlifers fast-approaching retirement are among \u201cthe least financially prepared\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey have typically missed out on final salary pensions and also the introduction of a lifetime of workplace pension saving through auto-enrolment.\n\n\u201cSome are looking to save more where they can, from spending less on holidays and luxuries items to renting out a spare room. But a significant group is still at risk of sleepwalking into retirement without sufficient savings to fund it.\u201d\n\nRecommended\n\n'Each of my holiday lets generates \u00a350,000 a year \u2013 here's how'\n\nRead more",

        "title": "Expedia Offers an Attractive Buyback Yield and Upside Potential",
        "content": "In the past 12 months, Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) has delivered a decent gain of 29%. However, its long-term performance is a bit disappointing. In the past 10 years, it has only returned 90%, or a compounded annual return of 6.60%, which is lower than the S&P 500 at 10.30%.\n\nAs such, with the projected business growth going forward, the stock is quite undervalued at the current price.\n\nBusiness overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with EXPE.\n\nExpedia is a leading online travel company that has a comprehensive global network with more than 3 million lodging properties, including 940,000 hotels, alongside partnerships with over 500 airlines and a wide array of rental car services, cruises, insurance options and experiences. This extensive offering is made accessible through three consumer brands: Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. The company operates across three main segments: Business to Consumer, Business to Business and Trivago.\n\nThe business-to-consumer segment, which is the primary source of revenue, generated $9.1 billion in 2023, accounting for approximately 71% of the company's total revenue. The business-to-business segment ranked second, contributing $3.39 billion, or 26.4% of the total. Trivago, the smallest segment, brought in $338 million in sales in 2023.\n\nExpedia offers a diverse range of services to both consumers and businesses, including airline bookings, advertising and media solutions and lodging. Lodging stands out as the most significant service category, generating $10.26 billion in revenue in 2023, underscoring the company's strong position in the online travel market.\n\nGrowing revenue and consistent profitability\n\nExpedia generates revenue by charging commissions on travel bookings made through its platform. This revenue comes from the gross bookings, which represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions. Expedia earns a percentage of these gross bookings as its revenue, known as the revenue margin. Therefore, the company can increase its revenue in two ways: by increasing gross bookings or by improving the revenue margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince 2005, the company has successfully grown its gross bookings every year, with the exception of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The gross bookings increased from $15.34 billion in 2005 to $107.87 billion in 2019. However, the pandemic severely impacted the global travel market, causing gross bookings to plummet to $36.80 billion. After the pandemic, gross bookings rebounded strongly to reach $104.10 billion in 2023. Expedia Offers an Attractive Buyback Yield and Upside Potential\n\nSource: Statista\n\nWith the exception of 2020, Expedia's revenue and operating income have followed a consistent growth trend over the past 19 years. Revenue increased annually from $2.12 billion in 2005 to $12 billion in 2019, while the operating income surged from $397 million to $961 million. In 2020, when the whole world was locked down, less people were travelling and a lot of airlines and hotels went bankrupt, Expedia's business was also negatively affected. Its revenue fell to $5.20 billion while the operating income plummeted to $1.53 billion in losses. Fortunately, the company's revenue has recovered to $12.84 billion in 2023 and the operating income rebounded to $1.47 billion, surpassing the pre-pandemic level. Expedia Offers an Attractive Buyback Yield and Upside Potential\n\nExpedia's business demonstrates notable resilience, with its performance only significantly impacted by extraordinary events like the pandemic. This resilience is underscored by the strong rebound in revenue and operating income, illustrating the company's robust recovery and growth capability in the aftermath of major global disruptions.\n\nHuge cash position with conservative leverage\n\nExpedia's balance sheet is quite strong with $2.8 billion in shareholders' equity at the end of 2023, including $5.66 billion in cash and restricted cash. Its long-term debt stood at $6.25 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $590 million. Thus, the company's net debt-to-equity ratio was quite conservative at 0.21. Debt maturities are spread from 2025 to 2031, with amounts due ranging from $750 million to $1.24 billion annually. The nearest debt obligation is $1.04 billion due in 2025. Given its operating cash flow of nearly $2.7 billion and substantial cash reserves, Expedia can comfortably manage its debt and interest payments. Expedia Offers an Attractive Buyback Yield and Upside Potential\n\nSource: Expedia's 10-K filing\n\nExpedia has regularly rewarded its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. However, due to the pandemic, the company paused dividend payments and shifted its focus to increasing share repurchases. Over the past two years, Expedia has spent $2.55 billion to buy back 24.30 million shares, which represents 15% of its total outstanding shares. In October, it announced a new share buyback program worth up to $5 billion, offering a juicy repurchase yield of 26.80% based on the current market price.\n\nPotential upside\n\nCompared to its competitors, including Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Expedia is currently the most undervalued with an Ebit multiple of 19.52, while Airbnb and TripAdvisor have multiples of 42.55 and 21.05. Expedia Offers an Attractive Buyback Yield and Upside Potential\n\nAnalysts predict Expedia's revenue could reach $15.23 billion by 2025. Assuming the company maintains its 2023 operating margin of approximately 11.40%, this would result in an operating profit of $1.74 billion. By applying a 20 times earnings multiple, Expedia's enterprise value could approach nearly $35 billion by 2025. After applying a 10% discount rate, the company's value is estimated to be $28.90 billion. We also assume the company repurchases 10% of its total shares by 2025, reducing the total share count to 122.60 million, the value per share could be approximately $236, which is 72% higher than the current price.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpedia can be considered a prime investment candidate with a robust balance sheet and prudent leverage, a resilient business model manifesting in consistent revenue and operating income growth, alongside a compelling potential for 72% upside in value. This unique combination of financial health, strategic market positioning and aggressive shareholder value enhancement initiatives, particularly through substantial share buyback programs, underscores Expedia's attractiveness.\n\nFor investors eyeing long-term gains within the rebounding travel sector, Expedia is a compelling opportunity, buoyed by its undervaluation relative to peers and promising growth trajectory.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +10.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb, Inc. belongs, has gained 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Airbnb, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of +66.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +20.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.66 points to a change of -35.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 indicates a change of +14.9% from what Airbnb, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Airbnb, Inc.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Airbnb, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $2.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.4%. The $11.08 billion and $12.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.8% and +11.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb, Inc. reported revenues of $2.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.6%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.57%. The EPS surprise was +13.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- IWG Plc is preparing to make a final call on pursuing a stock market listing in the US as the company seeks to persuade investors it should be valued more like tech darlings Uber Technologies Inc. or Airbnb Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmerica Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop. Supreme Court Rules Trump Can Appear on Presidential Ballots Wall Street\u2019s DEI Retreat Has Officially Begun China Scraps Premier Li's Briefing, Breaking Years of Convention Chicago to Go Ahead With Plan to Revamp Empty Downtown Towers\n\nThe London-listed flexible office company has switched the currency in which it reports to dollars and is reviewing adopting US GAAP accounting standards to reflect the fact that most of its earnings are generated in the region, according to a statement Tuesday. The group, which owns the Regus serviced office brand, will likely make an \u201cannouncement regarding the company\u2019s intentions\u201d during the first half of this year, it said.\n\nIWG would join an exodus of companies choosing to list in the US. While no final decisions have been taken, the company is likely to opt for a single listing, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Dixon. That could be a blow for London which has struggled to attract or retain companies to a stock market where performance has lagged. Technology champion Cambridge, England-based Arm Holdings Plc opted for a US float last year instead of in the British capital.\n\nThe potential shift to the US comes as IWG ramped up its expansion plans, doubling its rate of new center openings in 2023 thanks to its pivot toward franchising which has reduced spending on capital expenditure. Revenue climbed to \u00a33.3 billion ($4.2 billion) in the year through December, the highest in the company\u2019s 35-year history.\n\nThe company has been reshaping its portfolio to try to cash in on post-covid shifts in working patterns. It is betting on growing demand for flexible office space in locations that are closer to where people live, allowing them to cut commute times. Its also moved away from traditional leases and now positions itself as a partner for landlords that can operate flexible office spaces and share in the revenue generated through management agreements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has been trying to persuade investors that makes it a capital light platform business that is more like home sharing company Airbnb or Uber, which connects riders and drivers, than a traditional serviced office company. The evolution of its model is designed to be both less capital intensive and less exposed to the mismatch between long term liabilities and short term income inherent in renting and subletting.\n\nIWG\u2019s board is currently examining whether shifting to a US listing would help increase the multiple at which the company trades in part thanks to the greater depth of the US market, Dixon said in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Uber or Airbnb, their multiples are much higher than we are, we are at six to seven, they are in the 30s to 50s,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cPeople understand Uber or Airbnb, they just don\u2019t understand us yet. This is a platform business.\u201d\n\nThe company has struggled to persuade investors it deserves to be valued on a higher multiple in part because of a lack of comparable rivals, Dixon said. The closest competitor is WeWork Inc., the bankrupt flexible office company, but it is a fraction of IWG\u2019s size, mostly uses traditional leases and is concentrated in a few major city centers, he said.\n\nIWG has so far taken on about 40 to 50 locations that were previously operated by WeWork \u201cbut they haven\u2019t really done their big closure push just yet,\u201d Dixon added.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Private Equity\u2019s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation Into Monaco\u2019s Royal Family\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Airbnb, Inc. ABNB. This is because this security in the Internet - Content space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.\n\nThis is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board.

        "content": "Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) may be one of the best investments in the technology industry as it relates to travel and leisure at this time. I think that based on its software quality and diverse demographic reach, it has a significant advantage over its main competitors, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). I also consider it fairly valued, but there are risks related to the effective maintenance of its platform and associated reputation.\n\nFuture operations & market outlook\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ABNB.\n\nAirbnb is introducing four new property types: Vacation Home, Unique Space, B&B, and Boutique. It is also launching Collections, which are homes perfectly suited to specific occasions, like a family trip, a honeymoon, or a work stay. By expanding its scope of offerings in this way, the company is aiming to cater to the diverse needs of its users, potentially also attracting new customers.\n\nIt has also added two new tiers called Airbnb Plus and Beyond by Airbnb, which come under its luxury segment and will offer custom-designed trips, including the finest homes, unique experiences, and world-class hospitality.\n\nThe company is planning to use AI, most notably through its acquisition of the AI firm GamePlanner, creating its ultimate concierge' service. This intends to create a deeper level of personalization for users on the Airbnb app and website and marks the beginning of what should be an adaptive period of transforming its digital footprint.\n\nDeloitte reports that the leisure travel industry may face a correction as it could have hit the peak of pent-up demand following lock-down restrictions during the pandemic. Despite a slower economic environment across the world at the moment, travel seems to remain a priority for many, including a desire for more diverse locations. The rise of hybrid and remote working options is also facilitating growth in leisure travel and accommodation options like those provided by Airbnb. On the flip side, there is less business travel, and so any income Airbnb was receiving from corporate customers could be negatively affected over the long term. This is a result primarily of the adoption of digital meetings like those provided by Zoom (ZOOM) and Microsoft (MSFT) Teams.\n\nStory continues\n\nProfitability\n\nAirbnb's last earnings results were announced on 2/13/2024, and it missed EPS GAAP expectations by $1.10, reporting negative $0.55. That's somewhat of a shock, considering the last year has been instrumental in providing evidence that the company will be able to retain profitability from here on out. Next quarter estimates are positive on consensus, but at the lowest part of the year in its earnings cycle.\n\nHowever, investors will be pleased by its aggregate net margin of 48%, as provided by GuruFocus. This is in the top 5% of companies in the travel and leisure industry, and evidence of how strong profitability for Airbnb could become over the long term.\n\nI've compared Airbnb to two of its major and older competitors to represent the power of income it could generate in the future:\n\nBooking Holdings - net margin of 25.7% Expedia - net margin of 6.21%\n\nBoth of these firms are utilizing AI, including machine learning and data analytics, and have a high digital footprint. Airbnb may have an advantage over Booking.com and Expedia, as it has user-friendliness and a higher focus on cutting-edge design and technology, as well as a wider range of properties on offer.\n\nFinancial stability & shareholder value\n\nAirbnb's balance sheet is stable enough to make the stock investable, in my opinion. Its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.4, which is moderately lower than the industry median of 0.47. Consider how strong this is in comparison to Booking Holdings' equity-to-asset ratio of -0.02 and Expedia's of 0.07.\n\nShareholder returns have also been improved through the repurchase of common stock over the last two years, totaling $3,752 million. It also has not issued debt since 2021.\n\nNo margin of safety\n\nThe GF Value chart presents Airbnb stock as modestly undervalued at this time:  Airbnb: Strong Market Position Despite Earnings Miss\n\nInvestors might consider some present risk from its forward PE ratio of 32.7, much higher than the industry median of 16. However, its present PE ratio of 20.6 is equal to the industry median.\n\nOn analysis of the consensus EPS YoY growth estimates over the next decade, I have considered a 12.5% EPS without NRI growth rate as an annual average for my discounted cash flow analysis. I used the standard GuruFocus 4% terminal stage annual growth rate and a typical discount rate of 11%. My fair value estimate, when adding the company's tangible book value per share of $11.56, is $148.26, a -0.66% margin of safety on a stock price of $149.24. Therefore, I consider it reasonable to propose that Airbnb stock is fairly valued. Airbnb: Strong Market Position Despite Earnings Miss\n\nNotable risks\n\nHeimdal Security reports that Airbnb faces reputational risks related to how it manages its platform, and it must ensure that it does not allow users that are on regulatory, terrorist, or sanctions watchlists. To prevent this, the firm is utilizing predictive analytics, behavioral analysis, and machine learning to assess the risk of each host, guest, and listing.\n\nThe company also faces cybersecurity threats, such as fake renting offers and infected Wi-Fi networks, which can seriously negatively impact the user experience and reviews of Airbnb's platform if significant issues occur. The organization has faced phishing campaigns and data privacy concerns in the past, and threats related to its cybersecurity are likely to proliferate with the advent of AI used by criminal enterprises. Therefore, it is paramount that the company invests heavily in advanced cybersecurity technologies for risk mitigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nI think Airbnb could be an excellent long-term holding, and this may be the time to buy the company at the advent of it reporting profitability. There are risks, including significant competitors and reputational hazards in relation to how it manages its technology operations, but my analysis reveals that Airbnb may be one of the best investments in software travel & leisure. I estimate that the company is currently fairly valued, and my analyst rating for Airbnb stock is a moderate buy.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 countries with the most beautiful castles in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry, the revival of the tourism sector, the largest travel company in the world, and the investment in heritage tourism, and go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Beautiful Castles in the World.\n\nFrom their ancient gates to grand towers and magnificent grounds, there is something hauntingly beautiful about castles. For some, it is their location. For others, it is the history attached to them or their sheer size. And for yet others, it is because they are simply out of a fairytale. With all their majesty and grandeur, these medieval structures act as temporal transporters, visceral reminders that quests and battles and chivalry weren\u2019t always exclusive to fantasy novels. And although these strongholds were built as tangible symbols of repression and control, meant to play an essential role in the defense of a region, they are more likely to be invaded by curious tourists than raging soldiers in these modern times.\n\nThe Global Tourism Industry:\n\nTourism has evolved into a massive industry with time, encompassing several other sectors, such as hospitality, transport, entertainment etc. In 1950, at the dawn of the jet age, just 25 million people took foreign trips, and by 2019, that number had reached a mammoth 1.5 billion. As we mentioned in our article \u2013 30 Most Magical Places in the World\u2013 the global Travel & Tourism (T&T) industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% between 2021 and 2026, to be worth an estimated $8.9 trillion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe World Tourism and Travel Council has reported that the T&T sector contributed 7.6% to the global GDP in 2022, an increase of 22% from 2021 and only 23% below 2019 levels.\n\nRevival of the Tourism Sector:\n\nThe T&T industry was among the hardest hit by the pandemic, as people could no longer move around and the world came to an abrupt halt. Estimates from the United Nations World Tourism Organization show that international travel shrank by 72% in 2020, leading to 1.1 billion fewer trips taken and setting the industry back massively.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, 2022 witnessed a reversal in this trend as international borders began opening up, coupled with the disposable income people saved up during the lockdown, and their increasing longing to travel around. According to the WTO, more than 900 million tourists traveled internationally in 2022 - double the number recorded the previous year.\n\nLargest Travel Company in the World:\n\nWith a market cap of over $119 billion as of the writing of this piece, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) holds the title of being the largest travel company in the world. Operating in over 220 countries and 40 different languages, there are more than 28 million global listings available between hotels, homes, and apartments under the Booking travel sites.\n\nThe Connecticut-based travel technology company also strongly felt the shocks of the pandemic when its revenue fell by almost 55%, from $15.06 billion in 2019, to $6.8 billion in 2020. However, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) bounced back strongly and boasted a revenue of $17.09 billion in 2022 after the revival of international tourism, even higher than its pre-pandemic levels. The platform has also recently started conversational trip planning with ChatGPT.\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is ranked among the 13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nInvestment in Heritage Tourism:\n\nHeritage tourism offers travelers an opportunity to indulge in shared experiences through the celebration of culture, traditions, and history. Exploring destinations that are of cultural importance is becoming increasingly popular among tourists of all age groups and the heritage tourism industry has received a massive surge over the last couple of decades. According to IMARC Group, the global heritage tourism market was estimated at $587.1 billion in 2023, and is expected to reach $813.5 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 3.69% during the forecast period. Other than instilling a strong sense of identity among the people, cultural tourism also contributes billions of dollars and creates thousands of jobs for the local economies.\n\nInvesting in cultural heritage preservation not only safeguards our shared history, but it also has the power to transform destinations into vibrant, culturally enriched tourist attractions, thus enhancing their viability and contributing to their long-term sustainability. Among the many governments, philanthropists, and corporations contributing to this cause is also Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB).\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has donated almost $11 million to heritage organizations across Europe to help boost demand for heritage-related travel and even launched a new Historical Homes category in May 2022, making it easier for guests to discover heritage homes in Spain, Germany, Italy, France,the UK, and now also Belgium. There are around 45,000 listings in the Historical Homes category and just under 70% of European heritage listings on the platform are located in non-urban areas, helping to disperse the benefits of tourism to rural and lesser frequented destinations. To efficiently administrate historical houses and sites in various European countries, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) also launched the Heritage Academy \u2013 a training program for hosts that aim to put their historic houses on the platform.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is counted among the Top 20 Most Valuable Travel Companies in the World.\n\nWith that said, here are the Countries with the Most Beautiful Castles.  15 Countries with the Most Beautiful Castles in the World\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we have referred to sources such as CNN, Travel + Leisure, National Geographic etc., looking for Countries with the Most Scenic Castles. To make sure we give you the best of the best, we only shortlisted countries that appeared multiple times in the aforementioned sources, assigned them a score based on their number of appearances, and ranked them accordingly. When two or more countries had the same score, we ranked them by the number of foreign tourists they received in 2022 instead.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Luxembourg\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with its rich heritage of castles and palaces, is an ideal place for connoisseurs of medieval architecture and castleholics. Vianden Castle is one of the largest and most beautiful residences from the Gothic and Romanesque periods. Wiltz Castle, its picturesque village, and the entire \u00c9islek region are also rich in cultural treasures to explore.\n\nLuxembourg may well be among the small capitals in Europe, but it has a lot to offer.\n\n14. India\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4\n\nIndia, with its 42 UNESCO World Heritage sites, is home to some of the grandest and most spectacular castles to be found anywhere on this planet. Rajasthan, also known as \u2018The Land of Kings\u2019, is famous for its magnificent forts and beautiful palaces, among which is also the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur. An imposing structure covering an area of 1,200 acres, it is easily one of the Biggest Castles in the World.\n\n13. Ireland\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4\n\nIt is said that there are more than 30,000 castles and ruins left in Ireland today, most dating from the 12th to 16th centuries. This is mainly due to the fair share of internal rebellions and foreign invasions that the Emerald Isle has witnessed over the years. Arguably one of the most famous castles in Ireland, Blarney is a top destination for tourists from far and wide.\n\n12. Denmark\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5\n\nDenmark is home to some of the most captivating castles in Europe, but perhaps the best known one is Kronborg Castle, and for an interesting reason. William Shakespeare used this Danish castle as his inspiration for his play Hamlet.\n\nThe number of foreign visitors in Denmark has grown by 30% over the last decade and although it is relatively small in size, the country has accounted for around 45% of total overnight stays in all Nordic countries.\n\nDenmark ranks 12th in our list of Countries with the Most Fascinating Castles.\n\n11. Austria\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6\n\nAustria, with its rich history, exquisite architecture, and vibrant culture, is home to hundreds of castles and palaces, spread out from Bregenz to the west to Hainburg to the east.

Portugal\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 7\n\nFrom medieval-time defensive structures to splendid 20th-century masterpieces, Portugal boasts some of the Most Beautiful Castles in Europe. The National Palace of Pena \u2013 a UNESCO site \u2013 is the most famous castle in the southern European country, owing to its colorful appearance and imposing location atop the highest hill above Sintra.\n\nTourism is a key driver of the Portuguese economy, accounting for almost 15% of the national GDP before the pandemic.\n\n9. Italy\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 7\n\nItaly is home to 59 UNESCO World Heritage sites \u2013 the most in the world \u2013 so it comes as no surprise that the Bel Paese has made it to our list of Countries with the Prettiest Castles in the World. Scaligero Castle, located in the town of Sirmione on Lake Garda, is one of the best preserved medieval castles in Italy, and a rare example of lake fortification.\n\nItaly also has 4,723 miles of coastline, dotted with some of the most beautiful shores and seaside towns, putting it among the Countries with the Best Beaches.\n\n8. Czech Republic\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 8\n\nThe Czech Republic is a 'country of castles and ch\u00e2teaux', with almost 3,000 of them. Among the most popular is Hlubok\u00e1 Castle, a 19th century ch\u00e2teau inspired by both Windsor Castle and a white wedding cake.\n\nThe UNWTO stated last year that the Czech tourism industry was \u2018on track for full recovery\u2019, but some challenges are still plaguing the sector, such as the economic situation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n7. Romania\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 9\n\nRomania\u2019s opulent medieval culture is the major reason why the country is home to so many majestic castles and fortresses, most of them built between the 14th and 18th centuries. Among the most legendary of these structures is Transylvania\u2019s Bran Castle, home to perhaps the most influential character in pop culture history \u2013 Count Dracula.\n\nRomania\u2019s tourism board launched \u2018The Dracula Project\u2019 in the summer of 2013, developing \u2018vampire tourism\u2019 in earnest both as a way to boost economic growth in Transylvania and nationwide.\n\n6. Scotland\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 10\n\nScotland is an amazing destination that tourists always find enthralling. It is a land of history and legends, renowned for its rich heritage and idyllic sites. Scotland\u2019s castles are not popular only because they are so immaculately preserved, but because they are also set against some of the most breathtaking panoramas in Europe.\n\nTourism is one of the seven growth industries in Scotland, contributing more than $4.9 billion to the economy each year.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 25 Easiest Countries with Digital Nomad Visas for Remote Work. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 10 Easiest Countries with Digital Nomad Visas for Remote Work.\n\nWith international travel becoming more accessible over the years, people have embraced this culture with open arms. Immigration, in general, has witnessed an unprecedented increase due to multifarious reasons, comprising both worldly dire and individualistic choices. Moving across countries for leisure travel and remote work has also emerged as a significant component. According to a report by the Migration Policy Institute in 2022, with an upward trend in hiring remote workers by various companies, the concept of digital nomads is taking root. Hence, countries are also formulating their immigration policies accordingly. More than 60 countries around the world have now eased restrictions and opened doors for remote workers by providing specific digital nomad visas for remote work.\n\nBurgeoning Digital Nomad Trend\n\nCountries, especially developed industrialized states, around the world are focusing on attracting this new workforce. Reduction in red tape and the launch of new digital nomad visas are becoming widespread. More and more countries are offering digital nomad visas to attract talent from all over the globe. About 80% of the countries offering such visas process the applications within a month.\n\nIn the US, in 2023, 17.3 million Americans\u201411% of the workforce\u2014shifted towards the digital nomad category, marking a 131% increase from 2019 and a 2% change from 2022. Additionally, it is reported that 70 million more anticipate following suit in the next couple of years. While most digital nomads belong to the younger age group (58%), more nomads in the older age bracket have also started contributing at a higher rate in 2023, increasing their share to 42%. Men make up the majority of the workforce at 56%, compared to women at 43%, and non-binary individuals at 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvolving Work Dynamics\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic also had an immense impact on fostering the idea of remote work, a trend that research indicates is likely to persist. A survey revealed that 81% of digital nomad workers are highly satisfied with their work and lifestyle. Major companies, such as GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ: GTLB), have transitioned to a completely remote model, abandoning physical offices. Conversely, companies like Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP) have opted to keep their offices while prioritizing remote work.\n\nOther companies, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), utilize a hybrid model in which, for certain roles or during specific time periods, remote work is preferred. For instance, in the aftermath of the pandemic, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) decided to allow some employees to continue working from home permanently and extended the option for employees to work remotely for longer periods in subsequent years.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) is among the companies that have introduced a digital nomad policy, allowing employees to work in 170 countries for up to 90 days per year. Airbnb's co-founder and CEO, Brian Chesky, is a proponent of establishing a live and work anywhere policy. With this vision, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) partnered with Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) to promote their DE Rantau Initiative, aimed at facilitating digital nomad-friendly accommodations in Malaysia. 25 Easiest Countries with Digital Nomad Visas for Remote Work\n\n25 Easiest Countries with Digital Nomad Visas for Remote Work\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of the 25 easiest countries with digital nomad visas for remote work, we conduct extensive web research and select countries for which data related to visa cost and application time period are available.

Taiwan\n\nInsider Monkey Weighted Average: 17.2\n\nWhile Taiwan does not specifically offer a digital nomad visa, an equivalent in the form of the Taiwan Employment Gold Card can be obtained.

Barbados\n\nInsider Monkey Weighted Average: 15.2\n\nAnother Caribbean Island that offers multifarious advantages, including tax benefits, is the Barbados' Welcome Stamp-- an enticing opportunity to experience life in this beautiful country.

However, on the plus side, it is one of the easiest digital nomad visas for remote work, obtainable within 7 days. The monthly minimum requirement is estimated to be around $4,160.\n\n15. Mauritius\n\nInsider Monkey Weighted Average: 14.8\n\nMauritius\u2019s Premium Visa could very well be considered the easiest digital nomad visa for remote work, mainly due to its non-existent visa cost.

The White Card, launched in 2021, is not only one of the cheapest visas, costing only $116, but can also be acquired in an expedient manner, typically within 30 days. It primarily acts as a residency permit; however, couples or families cannot apply. The visa is granted with an in-person appointment and interview. Its duration is one year, with the provision for a second-year renewal. Applicants are also required to show a monthly minimum income of \u20ac2,000.\n\n12. Albania\n\nInsider Monkey Weighted Average: 14\n\nKnown as the Unique Permit Visa, Albania started offering this digital nomad visa in 2022, and it is considered one of the easiest remote work visas.

Although, for the moment, no specific minimum monthly income has been set, it is expected that an income higher than Albania\u2019s minimum wage has a greater acceptance probability.\n\n11. Curacao\n\nInsider Monkey Weighted Average: 13.8\n\nThe Temporary Stay Permit for remote workers under the @Home in Curacao program is an enticing offer for digital nomads.

        "content": "airbnb edinburgh\n\nAirbnb owners in Edinburgh could be charged for their bin collections to \u201cimprove street cleanliness\u201d following problems with short-term lets in the city.\n\nThe new charge would mimic those already levied by councils in England, including Dorset and Oxford, which mean that all short-let properties no longer qualify for free waste collection.\n\nThe plans, to be considered at the council\u2019s environment committee, would be separate from council tax or business rates already paid by owners.\n\nA Edinburgh City Council spokesman said: \u201cAs Edinburgh\u2019s vibrant short-term let sector transitions into a robustly regulated and better managed operation, it is important that we reflect on the past problems, and deal with any negative issues.\n\n\u201cWorking with operators on waste management will be an opportunity to both increase recycling and improve street cleanliness \u2013 this benefits them and our capital.\u201d\n\nAndy Fenner, of the Short Term Accommodation Association (STAA), said: \u201cCouncils need to be careful here because there\u2019s an important principle at stake.\n\n\u201cCurrently, holiday let owners will either be subject to council tax or business rates. If they pay council tax, then bin collections are included.\n\n\u201cWhichever way you look at it, these rentals are already paying someone for this service, so it\u2019s not clear what the justification for an additional charge would be.\u201d\n\nFor a one-night stay on March 28, there are more than 500 rooms or flats available in Edinburgh, ranging from \u00a318 for a bed in an 18-bed dormitory to \u00a31,900 for a home on the outskirts of the city that sleeps 34 people.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 available listings on Airbnb and other sites for the city in January 2024, data company AirDNA said, half the number available in January 2019.\n\nAn AirDNA spokesman said that while available rooms and flats dropped off during the pandemic, the newly introduced regulations had stopped supply in Edinburgh bouncing back.\n\nThis meant that the number of nights stayed in the Scottish capital dropped 41pc between January 2019 and January this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt comes after Scotland\u2019s government cracked down on short-term let owners.\n\nBed and breakfast or Airbnb owners must obtain a licence before they can advertise to guests under new rules that came into force in October. The new rules apply even to those who occasionally let out spare rooms. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has introduced a raft of new measures to crack down on short-term lets - Wiktor Szymanowicz/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nIt is a criminal offence not to have a short-term let licence, and owners can be fined up to \u00a32,500 if they are found to be operating without one.\n\nLevelling Up Secretary Michael Gove launched a consultation on forcing short-term let owners in England to register their properties on February 19.\n\nThe new rules will require owners to get planning permission for holiday lets in order to stop them \u201chollowing out\u201d local communities, although those who let their main home for less than 90 days annually will be exempted.\n\nMeanwhile, Leeds Building Society announced last week that it would stop handing out new mortgages to holiday let owners in North Norfolk and North Yorkshire for 12 months \u2013 starting from the end of March.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25easy ways to make money fast. We have also discussed the demographical difference between approaches to making money. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Easy Ways to Make Money Fast.\n\nIn 2024, the increase in people wanting quick money may stem from various factors. Economic uncertainties, exacerbated by global events or crises, could drive individuals to seek rapid financial solutions. Technological advancements may also play a role, with the proliferation of online platforms offering promises of easy wealth through schemes like cryptocurrency trading or affiliate marketing. Additionally, societal pressures or a desire for instant gratification in an increasingly fast-paced world might fuel the search for quick monetary gains.\n\nIt is, therefore, interesting to note that the pursuit of passive income is a common thread among investors of all ages, but there's a clear generational divide in both perception and approach. Younger generations, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, often misunderstand the true nature of passive income. Instead of seeking traditional avenues like dividends from stocks or interest from bonds, they gravitate towards crypto investments and side hustles, driven by the allure of quick returns and the flexibility it offers.\n\nFor instance, in a recent survey of 1,000 US investors with at least $10K in assets, respondents across age demographics ranked passive income as a top 2023 priority. However, while 80% of Millennials and 81% of Gen Z expressed interest in investing in Bitcoin, only 15% of Boomers considered it for passive income purposes.\n\nThe allure of passive income, however, often masks the reality of the effort required. While platforms and influencers may promote \"passive income ideas with no money\" on social media, these hustles often demand substantial ongoing effort, blurring the line between passive income and active side hustles. Boomers, on the other hand, tend to pursue more traditional forms of passive income, such as dividend stocks and real estate, recognizing the importance of stable, long-term investments in supplementing retirement income.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, in 2022, Zapier's survey revealed a major rise in the popularity of side hustles among Americans. The data indicated that 40% of Americans were engaged in side hustles, showcasing a noticeable increase from 34% in December 2020. Moreover, the survey highlighted a promising trend for continued growth, with over one-third of Americans expressing intentions to start a side hustle in 2022, compared to under one-fourth for 2021.\n\nNotably, men and younger adults appeared to be leading this charge. Men were more likely than women to currently have a side hustle (44% vs. 37%) and were also more inclined to start or plan one for 2022 (39% vs. 33%). Similarly, Gen Z and Millennials showed higher engagement in side hustles compared to Gen X and Boomers, with 59% and 61% respectively having a side hustle.\n\nDespite the perception of side hustles as time-consuming endeavors, the data revealed otherwise. Nearly half of side hustlers spent less than 10 hours a week on their additional pursuits, with the average annual income from side hustles amounting to $12,689. Automation emerged as a significant facilitator, with almost two-thirds of side hustlers incorporating automation in their businesses, attributing much of their success to time-saving technologies. Men and younger adults were notably more likely to utilize automation in their side hustles, indicating a strategic advantage in managing time and resources efficiently. 25 Easy Ways to Make Money Fast\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the easy ways to make money fast, we identified money-making strategies that had low barriers to entry, quick turnaround time, and scalability potential.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Free Travel Newsletters to Subscribe to in 2024.\n\nWhy Do We Need More Travel Newsletters?\n\nThe need for travel-based content is derived from the expanding travel industry. Travel newsletters provide travelers with information on destinations, important travel tips, and upcoming tours. While the travel industry has been consistently growing, travel companies expect growth rates to decline in 2024. On February 14, Reuters reported that the post-pandemic rebound period for the travel industry has begun to normalize. Travel companies expect 2024 to be an extremely busy year as more people set aside budget for vacations and hotels. However, the growth rate in demand is expected to decelerate. Large companies such as Marriot and Hilton are expected to experience single digital growth rates in profits, after double digital increases in 2023.\n\nOn February 16, Reuters reported that Thailand is set to waive the visa requirement for more countries. The Thai Prime Minister, Srettha Thavisin, suggested that citizens from more countries will now be able to travel to Thailand without a visa after it waived visas for Chinese and Indian tourists. The step will be taken to boost tourism demand revenue. Between January 1 and 11, Thailand welcomed 4.39 million tourists, a 48% increase from the previous year. The Chinese accounted for most of the tourists. The government foresees an influx of 34 million to 55 million foreign tourists this year, an increase of 28 million compared to the previous year.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) reported that Priceline launched its 2024 Winter Product Release. The new release brings a range of new generative artificial intelligence features along with upgrades to Penny, Priceline's AI travel assistant. The company has added 30 new tools to Penny aiming to streamline the travel planning and booking procedure. Penny provides customers with destination recommendations and personalized customer service. The company also offers consumers with the best deals.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is an online marketplace for consumers looking for short or long-term stays. The company acts as a broker and connects renters with consumers. On January 9, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) revealed the best time to book and schedule tours in 2024. The company suggests that to grasp the best deals, travelers should consider planning tours and bookings in March. The prices in March are expected to remain low compared to the rest of the year. However, tourists wishing to travel later this year may consider September and October to avail the most affordable deals. To acquire the best deals, users must keep an eye on the \"New\" category, pay attention to special offers, and opt for private rooms. According to the report, the company witnessed an 18% rise in bookings over the past year in the United Kingdom. These bookings were primarily for listings under \u00a3100 per night.

Pantheon Macroeconomics Founder and Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson joins Yahoo Finance as part of the Travel Guide 2024: Industry Insights special, commenting on wage growth and consumers' savings coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"There's a lot less savings hanging around that was built up during the pandemic. And if you look at the distribution of where that money is still sat, it's almost entirely in the hands of the top 20%.

Now, recent quarterly results from Expedia, Airbnb, Booking.com just to name a few pointing to a moderation in consumer spending. Now, this comes as Americans pull back on their discretionary spending. So what does that tell us about the consumer, and more broadly speaking, about the economy?\n\nJoining us now as part of Yahoo Finance's travel guide 2024 industry insights is Ian Shepherdson. He's Pantheon macroeconomics founder and chief economist. It's good to have you here. So let's talk about just what you're seeing, the trends that you're noticing from the consumer because we spent months and months and months talking about the fact that nothing is prompting Americans, consumers to really pull back on spending, yet we're starting to see that shift just a bit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIAN SHEPHERDSON: Yeah. I like the word moderation. I think that's a pretty fair description of what's likely to happen over the course of this year. You know, there's a couple of things to think about. First of all, there's just a bit less cash flow around for the consumer than there was last year. We've got slightly slower payroll growth, slower wage growth. We've got a much smaller annual uplift of Social Security payments this year, which gave 70 million people last year an 8.7% pay increase in January. This year, it's 3.2%.\n\nAnd then on the balance sheet side of the consumer story, there's a lot less savings hanging around that was built up during the pandemic. And if you look at the distribution of where that money is still sat, it's almost entirely in the hands of the top 20%. Most households now don't have any of the pandemic savings still remaining. So they can't spend it again. They spent it once. They can't do it again.\n\nSo I think that suggests maybe a dichotomy where if you're at the top end of the business, the travel, the leisure sectors, and maybe even in terms of goods as well, your customers still have money. But most households by definition are not in the top 20%. And they're going to find things much more difficult. They're going to be relying on cash flow rather than savings. And they've got a lot less cash flow than they did. So I can see that bifurcation. And in the mass market, yeah, I think the moderation will become quite visible over the next few months.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And so how does that flow through to some of the companies that we were just laying out here? Where perhaps in that discretionary spend here on the experience economy and in that travel experience are you seeing consumers at least think about perhaps trading down?\n\nIAN SHEPHERDSON: Yes, trading down. But at the very high end, I think things are going to be fine. The stock market has boomed over the last few months, and a lot of the people in the top 20%, especially the 1%, are still holding onto huge gains both in cash and other less liquid assets that they've accumulated over the last few years. It's more the kind of middle and lower end of the market that's, I think, going to be struggling for occupancy or for people's willingness to spend on extras.\n\nAll the trading up that we saw in that sort of post pandemic surge of the revenge spending in restaurants and leisure activities and concerts and movies and all that sort of stuff, at the margin, I would expect that the extra dollar that we were seeing over the last couple of years just not to be there to quite such a same extent. I don't overdo this. I'm not looking for the consumer to roll over at all.\n\nBut real income growth after tax last year grew by more than 4%, which is almost double the long-run average. There was a lot of money around. This year, it'll be more like two, which is a little bit below the long-run average. So not terrible. But I think if anyone's in the consumer facing world just extrapolating what they saw in '23 and hoping to get a repeat performance in '24, that's going to be a struggle.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Seeing as we have consumers pushing back on higher spending, consumers trading down in some instances, what do you think that tells us then about that last mile fight here to ease inflation? Or, in fact, are we going to see maybe inflation continue to ease in that last mile won't be as tough as maybe some forecasters had initially anticipated?\n\nIAN SHEPHERDSON: Yeah. I mean, there's been a lot of hysteria over one, not great inflation print for January. But if you look at the performance over the second half of last year, the core PCE deflator, which is the number the Fed really cares about, that was 2% annualized in the third quarter and 2% annualized in the fourth quarter. I mean, that's the target rate.\n\nSo we've made an enormous amount of progress. And I'm not really worried that it's going to be difficult to keep it down at that rate in the foreseeable future. Yeah, you get bad months. You might even get a bad quarter. But the big picture is, I think, one of much less pressure across supply chains.\n\nWe're not seeing expanding margins like we saw in '22/'23. And in some sectors, margins have come down quite a lot. That's why used car prices are falling so fast because dealers' margins have dropped very sharply. And I think we'll see that spreading across more sectors as consumers, again, make that marginal decision with the extra dollar to keep it rather than to spend it.\n\nSo that should keep a bit of a lid on some of the inflation pressure as well. And across a big array of services, it's really all about the labor market. And the fact is that wage growth, which was at the peak 6% is now heading rapidly down to less than 4%. So all of these things are moving in the right direction. Some of it's still in the pipeline rather than in the CPI and the PCE inflation data, but it'll get there. It's just a matter of time.\n\nBRAD SMITH: With regard to that, leisure and hospitality was, of course, the hardest hit over the course of the pandemic and then had some of the biggest comeback that it needed to make as well in the labor and employment situation. Where are we starting to see that normalize?\n\nIAN SHEPHERDSON: Oh, I mean I think you can see pretty clearly that total frenzy of rehiring that we saw beginning in the summer of '21 and stretching really right the way through '22, that's pretty much over now. And what's interesting is that you can see that in the way that employees are behaving because what we saw in '21 and '22 was a huge increase in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs just so they could walk across the street to a different hotel or a different restaurant and pick up a pay raise. Great. Why wouldn't you do that?\n\nAnd we saw that behavior on a scale that we've never seen before in '21 and '22. And now it's back to normal. So the quits rate, which is the official measure of this behavior is now exactly where it was in 2018/19. And we know that the number of job openings is declining pretty steadily. And we know that wage growth is slowing as well. So we've got a fairly uniform picture here of a labor market that's beginning to look recognizably normal looking back at the pre-pandemic period.\n\nAnd in that pre-pandemic period, we did not have an inflation problem. In fact, most of the 10 years running up to the pandemic, we were fretting, Fed was fretting that inflation was too low. I'm not suggesting we're immediately going to go back to inflation that's too low, but I do think we're heading back to the conditions where getting to the target and staying there is an entirely sensible forecast at this point.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Ian Shepherdson, really interesting insight. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us here this morning. Pantheon macroeconomics founder and chief economist, thanks so much, Ian.",

        "title": "New York's Hotels Could Reap $380M From Short-Term Rental Rules",
        "content": "Illustration: Giordano Poloni\n\nA few months ago, New York City started cracking down in earnest on short-term rentals through sites such as Airbnb. The move was always going to be a positive for the hotel industry.\n\nJust how positive it\u2019s already turned out to be is kind of remarkable.\n\nThe law is expected to result in 2.2 million additional hotel room nights in 2024 that otherwise would not have been booked. That\u2019s according to a report from brokerage JLL (JLL), which painted a bullish picture in general for New York hotels still struggling with the effects of COVID-19.\n\nEnforcement of the short-term rental crackdown, called Local Law 18, started in September 2023. It essentially requires most hosts of rentals that run for fewer than 30 consecutive days to register with the city, and forbids platforms such as Airbnb and Vrbo from facilitating bookings from unregistered hosts. Local Law 18 mandates other things of hosts and guests, such as hosts having to be present in the property during the short-term stay. As a result of the law, too, the city now maintains a database of buildings that prohibit short-term rentals.\n\nThe rules were meant to squelch what were in many cases illegal hotels: condos and apartments \u2014 sometimes several in the same building \u2014 where tenants turned over regularly just like guests in legal hotels. Now, the law is also poised to boost a hotel industry that backed its creation.\n\n\u201cThe effects of Local Law 18 will likely be felt toward the end of this year as true enforcement did not begin till September 2023,\u201d Vijay Dandapani, president and CEO of the Hotel Association of New York City, said in an email last week.\n\nHe did say that while hotels were seeing \u201cheightened demand\u201d due to the law, its impact so far was diluted by challenges such as migrants occupying roughly 12 percent of the city\u2019s hotel room inventory and New York\u2019s longstanding ban on building youth hostels. Hotel occupancy in 2023 also trailed figures in 2019, the last full year before COVID-19, Dandapani noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo the anticipation of the gains from Local Law 18 is welcome news for the hotel industry. JLL assumed a 70 percent drop in the supply of short-term rentals following the law\u2019s enactment. That\u2019s the equivalent of shutting down 107 hotels with an average of 255 rooms, the report said. In fact, the number of short-term rental listings on Airbnb, Vrbo and the like in New York City declined 89 percent the first month Local Law 18 was enforced, according to law firm Tane Waterman & Wurtzel.\n\nThose 2.2 million additional room nights are expected to translate into $380.4 million in additional revenue for hotels in 2024, according to JLL. That, the report said, would in turn spur revenue per available room \u2014 or RevPAR, the industry\u2019s gold standard for measuring financial performance \u2014 to levels not seen since before the Global Financial Crisis 15 years ago.\n\nThe fiduciary kick from the short-term rental rules alone underscores a wider trend in revenue for New York City hotels. In fact, 2023\u2019s RevPAR was 15.2 percent higher than 2019\u2019s average, per JLL, and New York\u2019s was the highest among the major markets the brokerage tracked.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, I think, we\u2019ve seen rates driving the recovery, whereby if you look at historical trends for New York City, occupancy has always been the lead of a recovery after every trough to peak,\u201d said Stephany Chen, a JLL executive vice president and an author of the report. (Occupancy ended 2023 shy of 90 percent, below pre-pandemic highs for nightly room use.)\n\nThe reasons for what turned out to be record average daily room (ADR) rates in 2023 \u2014 the figure ended the year at $301.12, per CoStar data cited by JLL \u2014 included pent-up demand from travelers willing to pay the prices, Chen said. Inflation, of course, played a role in the higher prices as it did for so many other products and services.\n\nAccompanying the boost from the restrictive rental rules is also a lack of new supply. The city\u2019s hotel pipeline is expected to expand at an average annual rate of only 1.6 percent over the next three years. That\u2019s 140 basis points below the previous 10-year average, per JLL.\n\nFewer hotels are being built in NYC partly because of higher construction costs due to inflation \u2014 and the perennial labor and land costs that are higher in New York than in most U.S. markets. JLL pegged the per-room cost of full-service hotel development in 2023 at $796,000, the highest it\u2019s ever recorded and 22 percent costlier per room than acquisitions. No new hotels opened in the city last year on a net basis; 16 opened in 2022.\n\nNew supply is also constrained by another set of city rules: a special permitting process officials enacted in late 2021. That process essentially restricted hotel development in most of the city, and made it more expensive for developers to build and brands to operate through requiring the use of unionized labor. Hotel developers, too, are now subject to the same financing constraints due to higher borrowing costs as other builders.\n\nWhatever the hazards for developers, this all leaves the existing New York hotel pool in which investors and owners \u2014 and their brokers \u2014 swim particularly warm and deep. Transaction volume in 2023 was its highest since 2016 at $3.3 billion, and JLL expects the volume to increase this year and beyond as borrowing costs level off or decline.\n\nMuch of the investment could come from not only what the report called \u201cfrustrated capital\u201d awaiting lower borrowing costs but also from foreign capital. A third of hotel investment in New York in 2023 came from foreign buyers \u2014 the greatest share of any cohort that JLL tracked, and far ahead of the 1 percent shares that foreigners claimed in 2021 and 2022. Most of those buyers were from the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia. There\u2019s also that significant difference \u2014 22 percent \u2014 between developing a new hotel room and simply acquiring one.\n\nThen there\u2019s one other factor breaking the industry\u2019s way: an expected jump in international visitors. The number of international tourists to New York increased just under 15 percent annually in 2023, to 10.8 million, according to the city. (Domestic tourism was up 7.9 percent.) The United Kingdom, Canada, France, Brazil and Germany sent the most. China used to be among the top sources of international tourists but enacted strict travel restrictions during COVID. Those restrictions ended in August 2023, and visits are expected to dramatically pick up through 2024.\n\nThese visits undercut the primary argument that short-term rental sites such as Airbnb made against Local Law 18. The theory went that fewer short-term rentals would exacerbate the cost of visiting the city \u2014 a city that needed the trade from visitors to claw its way back from COVID economically. Airbnb, for instance, released a survey in December that it said showed 65 percent of respondents were less likely to visit due to high hotel costs and a further 54 percent were likely to book short-term stays through \u201cunregulated platforms.\u201d\n\nThe visits to New York City are instead on an upward trajectory, and a hotel industry that backed Local Law 18 is reaping the benefits.\n\n\u201cNew York, as an example, saw its strongest RevPAR ever in 2023, and that was still without about 30 to 40 percent of international travel,\u201d said Zach Demuth, JLL\u2019s global head of hotels research and an author of the report. \u201cAnd international travelers not only stay longer, because they\u2019re coming from farther away, but they often skew toward the more upscale luxury segments. So, the fact that the market was able to drive historic ADR and RevPAR without a key segment gives a lot of optimism for the future.\u201d\n\nTom Acitelli can be reached at tacitelli@commercialobserver.com.\n\nTrending Commercial Observer Stories\n\nStarwood Capital Group Hires Blackstone\u2019s Jonathan Pollack as President Newmark CEO: Here\u2019s Why We Beat Other Brokerages on Talent Former Trump International Hotel in DC Defaults on $285M Loan [Updated] How CRE Loans Threaten New York Community Bank and Other Regionals in 2024 Barings in Contract to Buy 1370 Avenue of the Americas for Roughly $160M\n\nRead the original story New York's Hotels Could Reap $380M From Short-Term Rental Rules and others by Tom Acitelli at Commercial Observer.",

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 20 Best Kept Secret Places to Visit in USA. You can skip our detailed analysis of the tourism and travel industry, and go directly to the 5 Best Kept Secret Places to Visit in USA.\n\nThe art of tourism involves exploring uncharted territory, finding comfort in the embrace of unfamiliar surroundings, and fully integrating oneself into the tapestry of various civilizations. This voyage has the power to transform, revealing hidden gems, igniting the spirit of adventure, and cultivating a deep connection with the natural world.\n\nThe worldwide tourism market is projected to surge at a CAGR of 5% over the next ten years, with an estimated value of $10.5 trillion in 2022. It is anticipated by analysts at Future Market Insights that the tourism market would reach an estimated value of $17.1 trillion in 2032. It is predicted that the proliferation of new trends like adventure tourism, art tourism, and so forth will speed up the development of the global tourist sector. Adventure tourism, which includes activities like rock climbing, mountaineering, excavation, kayaking, and other sports, has been an important driver of the tourism market share in recent years. Second, the use of tourist websites plays a crucial role in the management and monetization of all forms of tourism. It is additionally expected that social networking sites' growing popularity would present a great opportunity for the expansion of the travel industry.\n\nCountries with a thriving tourism industry, including the United States, France, and other European nations, are among the most renowned travel destinations worldwide. However, in recent years, several lesser-known Asian and African nations have emerged in popularity as getaways for foreigners, as per Future Market Insights. To take advantage of the possible financial gains from this shift, global travel service providers are realigning their services.\n\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by Forbes, despite facing challenges, travel remained popular among Americans in 2023, with an average of 2.1 leisure trips per person. Out of the respondents, 36% took three or more trips. Looking ahead to 2024, 92% of participants expressed their intention to either maintain or increase their travel plans, although there was a slight decrease compared to the previous year. Specifically, 40% planned to take more trips, down from 49% in 2023. Notably, 39% of respondents anticipated spending more on travel, indicating resilience in their budgets, albeit slightly lower than the 45% reported last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn light of concerns over inflation, 46% of participants adjusted their travel plans. This adjustment included 19% opting for fewer trips and 18% favoring road trips over flying. Additionally, the utilization of travel benefits on credit cards decreased from 66% in 2023 to 57% in 2024, reflecting evolving financial strategies in response to changing economic shifts.\n\nDespite economic pressures, the desire to travel remains a top priority across generations, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials. A significant 56% and 49% of these age groups, respectively, have expressed plans to embark on more trips. As for popular travel choices in 2024, visiting family and friends takes the lead with 46%, followed by beach vacations at 36% and road trips at 34%.\n\nAmid inflation concerns, 30% of respondents are uncertain about changing their travel plans, adopting a cautious approach. Travelers prioritize experiences despite economic uncertainty, utilizing reward points and looking for ways to cut costs.\n\nAs reported by the European Travel Commission, in 2023, European tourism showed promising signs of recovery, nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels despite visitors being 1.6% lower than in 2019. However, a 23% inflation surge significantly impacted travel expenses, particularly with a 49% increase in international flight costs and a 35% rise in hotel rates. While Southern Europe experienced robust growth, Eastern Europe lagged. Notwithstanding a major 67% decline in Chinese arrivals in contrast to 2019, North American markets rebounded. Despite pricing challenges, Europeans prioritize safe and affordable destinations. The European Travel Commission additionally forecasts that the travel industry will persist and expand in 2024, with a focus on sustainability throughout this period of transition.\n\nAs we shed light on sustainability, recently, The Sustainable Flight Fund of United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) has surpassed $200 million in investments, marking a noteworthy landmark. United Airlines Holdings Inc.

        "title": "Airbnb Is at an Inflection Point as Travel Demand Returns",
        "content": "Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported its full-year 2023 earnings last week, and the results were much better than expected. The company divulged that travel demand surpassed expectations and there were indications in its metrics that implied demand would sustain throughout the year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ABNB.\n\nIn addition, the San Francisco-based company announced a $6 billion share buyback program. This is a new buyback program in addition to the $2.25 billion worth of shares it had already repurchased using its own free cash.\n\nWith demand returning and the company firing on all of its financial metrics, I believe this travel experience company's stock is now at the turn of the tide with room to grow.\n\nBusiness model in the post-pandemic world\n\nFounded over a decade ago, Airbnb developed its online platform as a marketplace that allows people to rent out their properties to travelers and other consumers looking for accommodation. Over time, the company also added the Experiences feature, which allows travelers to sign up for activities with local hosts or with other tour guides, allowing travelers to get unique experiences. Since the pandemic, Airbnb has also allowed hosts to offer online-only experiences.\n\nHowever, in the last few years, the company has been subject to severe criticism from travelers using the platform because Airbnb would allow its hosts to charge exorbitant incremental fees (room cleaning fees, as an example), in addition to the overall cost of a stay. In the last year, management has embarked on a mission to be upfront and transparent with its listing fees and, in some cases, to eliminate incremental fees entirely to build trust with its user base.\n\nConsidering the company operates its business model as a marketplace platform, it manages the supply of hosts' properties with the demand from travelers and makes money by charging fees for any transaction that it facilitates on its platform. Hence, I will be reviewing operating metrics such as gross booking value.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuarterly results show demand coming back to the platform\n\nAirbnb's fourth-quarter revenue pleasantly surprised me as it grew by 17% to $2.20 billion, surpassing the $2.17 billion consensus estimates as well as the company's own guidance. Further, gross bookings value increased by 15% to $15.50 billion, as can be seen in the chart below, as the number of Nights and Experiences booked on the platform grew 12% to 98.80 million. Airbnb Is at an Inflection Point as Travel Demand Returns\n\nThis news was a positive development from what management guided for in in the third quarter, when they expected Nights and Experiences booked to moderate in the fourth quarter due to slower travel demand as geopolitical tensions took center stage in October of last year.\n\nWhile reviewing the underlying metrics, I noticed many indicators that looked a lot healthier. Longer-term stays of 28 days on the platform accounted for 19% of gross nights booked sequentially, increasing from the 18% level seen in the prior quarter. Even better, nights booked for trips over three months advanced approximately 20% compared to the year-ago quarter. Moreover, average daily rates increased by 3% from last year, suggesting travelers did not mind paying the marginal increase in rates.\n\nDemand dynamics on the platform also helped the company slightly increase its take rates to 14.30% from 14.10%. All these developments appeared to have an immediate positive effect on Airbnb's revenue, in my opinion, which increased 17% year over year to $9.90 billion, beating expectations. In addition to observing these trends, I also found some of the commentary from management to be very encouraging, as they noted they were seeing particular demand strength from first-time bookers who were booking more Nights on the platform.\n\nOn the earnings front, Airbnb reported a loss of $349 million, or 55 cents a share, in the fourth quarter vs. a profit of $319 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarterly results included a charge of about $1 billion related to tax expenses. Excluding the tax charge and other adjustments, management reported net income of $489 million, an increase of 53%. I believe this was a strong show of earnings, minus the one-time tax charge, leading Airbnb to report record free cash of $3.8 billion, an increase of 12.70% year over year. Airbnb Is at an Inflection Point as Travel Demand Returns\n\nThe company holds about $2.20 billion in debt. It carries about $2 billion of that debt in the form of 2026 convertible senior notes, while the rest is operating lease liabilities.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the previous section, I noted how some net positive developments were increasing the prospects for Airbnb's outlook in 2024. When answering a question about the macroenvironment moving forward on the earnings call, Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson said:\n\n\"I think that we continue to see a very robust demand for people staying on Airbnbs versus just necessarily kind of buying other things. So the experiences over things continues to be a big trend. And we're excited to see the growth that we're continuing to see in our established businesses in North America and Europe and even greater growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. As I said on the last question about doubling down and making sure that we invest in these expansion countries where we're underpenetrated, I think, that's going to continue to drive growth for us for the rest of the year.\"\n\nPer the above commentary, management also revealed their intentions to focus on newer and underpenetrated markets, giving the company considerable upside to scale the gross bookings value on the platform.\n\nFor the first quarter, management projects revenue to grow 13% to $2.05 billion, ahead of consensus expectations of $2.03 billion. While management expects adjusted Ebitda to grow on a nominal basis, it anticipates adjusted Ebitda to contract to at least 35% versus the 37.40% seen in 2023. I believe the company will slightly expand its marketing budget this year to further expand just when demand is returning to the platform. Management spoke of investing in marketing initiatives such as full-funnel marketing. Moreover, I agree with management's view of expanding marketing budgets this year as Airbnb expands into newer markets. Airbnb Is at an Inflection Point as Travel Demand Returns\n\nAssuming Airbnb's revenue grows at a compounded annual rate of 12.20% through 2028, I expect the company to expand its margins back to at least 37%, implying Ebitda will grow by a 14% rate on an adjusted basis. With these growth rates, a forward price-earnings ratio of 27 would be justified, implying upside from current levels.\n\nRisks and other factors to consider\n\nOne of the key strengths of Airbnb is the supply of property listings that are available on its booking platform. If hosts on its platform do not see additional incentives in listing their properties on the platform, it would affect the supply of properties which, in the long run, would deter travelers from booking on Airbnb and moving to competitors. Competitors such as Expedia-owned (NASDAQ:EXPE) Vrbo and Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) compete with Airbnb directly in the vacation rentals market, but Airbnb prides itself by differentiating its rentals platform from others on the strength of its supply. Per the earnings report, active listings on the platform exceeded 7.70 million in 2023, over three times more than the 2 million listings that Vrbo mentioned it had for the same period, per Expedia's recent 10-K report. So far, Airbnb has managed the hosts' supply of its platform economics well, but were hosts to move over their properties to competitors such as Vrbo, it would impact the company.\n\nAdditionally, travel aggregator sites such as Expedia and Booking.com also work with hotel chains and other large lodging companies to list their hotel rooms on their websites. If Airbnb ceases to offer day rates at comparative value to hotel chains, it may severely impact its bookings and revenue prospects. Many travelers may directly book with hotel chains as well, which represents a lost opportunity for Airbnb.\n\nFinally, regulation is another gray area that poses some headwind for the company. In September, New York's short-term rental law went into effect, impacting many Airbnb hosts' ability to lease rentals for less than 30 days. While the company says the impact is not material, it would become a significant headwind if other jurisdictions drafted similar bills.\n\nTakeaways\n\nFor now, the changes that Airbnb has made to its business model is working well and the company looks set to reap the benefits of its cost initiatives and investments. The company is demonstrating acuity in managing platform dynamics by inviting more hosts and giving travelers compelling reasons to use its platform. With these trends persisting throughout the year, I expect Airbnb's stock to move higher.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Here Are My Top 5 Undervalued Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Despite the market reaching all-time highs, there are still plenty of undervalued stocks in the market. As I continuously deploy new contributions, these are some of the stocks I'll be looking at buying, as they represent great value in a time of exuberance.\n\nThis list of five companies is a great start if you're looking for stock ideas in today's market.\n\n1. PayPal\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is by far one of the most undervalued stocks in the market. The payment processor has multiple products beyond the checkout experience that consumers are familiar with and is still growing at a healthy pace.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, PayPal's revenue rose 9%, and earnings per share (EPS) increased 61% to $1.29. Despite these strong figures, the market prices of PayPal's stock make it seem like a company with no or declining growth. PYPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nWith the stock trading for an unbelievably cheap 11.5 times forward earnings and with a strong business, PayPal's stock is a no-brainer buy.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often dubbed the \"Amazon of Latin America,\" but it's a lot more than that. While MercadoLibre has an e-commerce and logistics business like Amazon, it also has a fintech offering that gives it even more reach.\n\nBoth its commerce and fintech divisions have done quite well, with the segments' revenue rising 76% and 61% year over year, respectively, on a currency-neutral basis. Furthermore, MercadoLibre's margins have dramatically expanded over the past few quarters. MELI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith the stock trading at around 6.8 times sales (well below its decade-long average), it remains a great buy today.\n\n3. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) consistently proves doubters wrong. Whether it was COVID-19, a recession, or municipalities cracking down on short-term rentals, multiple events should have ended the company.\n\nBut it just keeps growing.\n\nAirbnb's Q4 revenue rose 17% year over year, with nights and experiences booked increasing by 12%. Despite this success, the stock trades at a cheap 26 times free cash flow (Airbnb's earnings are currently skewed due to a couple of one-time events that render the price-to-earnings ratio useless).\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result of its cheap stock price, Airbnb has enacted a massive stock buyback program. Airbnb will spend up to $6 billion on stock repurchases. If Airbnb deploys those funds within a year, it will have a total effectiveness of just under $5 billion, as it spent $1.1 billion on stock-based compensation in 2023.\n\nWith Airbnb worth shy of $100 billion, that means shares outstanding will shrink by around 5% -- a huge win for investors. Because the business is doing well and management recognizes its cheap stock price, Airbnb looks like a solid buy now.\n\n4. dLocal\n\ndLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) is a company few have heard about. It provides payment processing services for emerging market countries like Indonesia, India, Peru, and Egypt that large customers like Amazon, Nike, and Shopify can use to easily access these markets without developing their payment systems.\n\nThis product has proved wildly popular, and dLocal's revenue growth reflects that. In the third quarter, revenue rose 47% year over year thanks to total processed volume rising 69%. dLocal is also profitable and produced earnings per share of $0.14 in Q3.\n\nDespite its success, dLocal's anonymity in the marketplace causes it to have a dirt-cheap stock price of 21 times forward earnings. That level of growth combined with a low price is a recipe for a stock that can skyrocket, which makes me want to own more dLocal shares.\n\n5. Visa\n\nLastly is Visa (NYSE: V), the credit card processing giant. Visa is a staple in many portfolios, as the stock has consistently beaten the market over long periods thanks to constant growth, share buybacks, and improving profitability.\n\nIts results for the fiscal first quarter of 2024, ended Dec. 31, 2023, continue that trend, with revenue growing 9% and EPS increasing 20% year over year. Even with this strength, Visa's stock trades for 32 times earnings -- one of the consistently lowest valuation points over the past five years.\n\nVisa is a long-term strong executor, showing no signs of slowing. With a portfolio staple like Visa on sale for the first time in a while, investors would be smart to scoop some up to balance out some of the high-growth companies on this list.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here: 2 Magnificent Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold",
        "content": "Growth stocks are back in style. The current bull market has been going on for over a year and was preceded by challenging conditions that especially affected growth-oriented corporations. Investors might be tempted to profit from the ongoing bull run by buying shares of equities that can outperform in this period.\n\nHowever, picking stocks that can deliver outsize returns beyond the current run is even more important. Two great examples are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Airbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB).\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMany doubted Amazon in 2022. The company's revenue growth was not impressive, advertising sales were lagging, expenses were rising, and it delivered a rare net loss. The tech giant has pulled off a remarkable comeback since, partly thanks to improved economic conditions. Amazon also initiated cost-cutting measures that helped lift its bottom line back into the green.\n\nAmazon's shares have delivered excellent returns over the past year, but there is a more important lesson here.\u00a0Amazon's business is solid enough to handle challenging market and economic conditions and come out stronger.\n\nThe company's long-term prospects remain intact, too, even with a market cap of $1.76 trillion. Amazon is a leader in nearly every industry where it does business, many of which have miles of growth left ahead. No competitor has a greater market share in e-commerce in the U.S. or the global cloud computing space, which looks especially promising.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing segment is the most profitable of all. In 2023, Amazon Web Services' (AWS) revenue of $90.8 billion accounted for almost 16% of the company's total sales of $574.8 billion. However, AWS' operating income came in at $24.6 billion, nearly 67% of Amazon's operating income of $36.9 billion. And last year was a down year for the cloud market: AWS' sales increased by just 13.3% year over year.\n\nThere is a long runway for growth for Amazon's AWS, which arguably benefits from switching costs. Amazon's bottom line and margins will only improve with the increased adoption of its cloud services. The company is also making a play in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The most important aspect of Amazon's business is that the company has constantly found new and promising growth avenues to exploit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been somewhat unsuccessful sometimes, but over the long run, Amazon should succeed in finding new exciting growth avenues, be it in AI, healthcare, or elsewhere. Amazon is not only an outstanding stock to ride the current bull market, but also an equally excellent pick for investors looking far beyond it.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb's stock has lagged the market over the last year, though the company has generally recorded strong financial results.\n\nIn 2023, the vacation rental platform recorded revenue of $9.9 billion, 18% higher than the previous fiscal year. Airbnb's net income of $4.8 billion more than doubled year over year, while it ended 2023 with a free cash flow of $3.8 billion, a slight increase from the $3.4 billion reported in 2022.\n\nWhy is Airbnb failing to keep pace with broader equities despite its strong results? There are likely at least two reasons. First, the company has had to deal with new laws that affect its business in notable areas, such as New York, over the past year. Second, Airbnb's stock looks expensive based on traditional valuation metrics. ABNB PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nPerhaps the market expected even stronger results. These issues are hardly a deal breaker, though, at least for investors looking at the long term.\n\nFor one, Airbnb's ecosystem continues to expand. The company now has more than 5 million hosts and 7.7 million listings. An important aspect of Airbnb's business is its platform network effect, so the more its ecosystem grows, the stronger its economic moat becomes.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbnb is taking advantage of key opportunities by entering underpenetrated markets. The company listed Germany, Brazil, and Korea as three regions where it delivered exciting results recently.\n\nAirbnb is just getting started. Management also pointed to new growth opportunities by announcing it was going \"beyond the core.\" While Airbnb did not give many details, investors should be thrilled.\n\nIn my view, there is enough growth potential within the company's core: People won't stop traveling anytime soon. Airbnb is one of the best and most popular platforms for travel arrangements. Adding more functions to its core offering could unlock massive opportunities.\n\nThe bottom line: Airbnb's recent underperformance shouldn't scare off investors. The stock remains an excellent buy-and-hold option.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we are going to take a look at the 15 best family vacations on a budget for $5000. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the US travel industry, you can directly go to the 5 Best Family Vacations on a Budget for $5000.\n\nAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the US has been one of the countries leading the rebound of the tourism industry in a post-pandemic era. As per WTTC\u2019s report, the US travel and tourism sector contributed $2 trillion to the country's GDP in 2022, showcasing a 16.9% increase. 2.7 million more jobs were created compared to the previous year, which shows this sector's high employment potential. Things were looking up at the end of 2022, but that trend didn\u2019t carry forward into the year 2023.\n\nState of Tourism in the US\n\nAccording to the US Travel Association, the country had only reached 84% of 2019 visitation levels by December 2023, with a gap of 16% still needing to be overcome. In addition, a report commissioned by US Travel and conducted by Euromonitor revealed further insights into how the US compared to other top travel destinations worldwide. Among 18 countries, the US ranked second to last, with an overall score of 47/100. In the report\u2019s findings, the US ranked last in terms of visa wait times as well as the strength of national leadership and tourism strategies. US visa interview wait times can go up to 400 days in many top markets, making the US an unreliable place to travel to. The issue of national leadership occurred because the US doesn\u2019t boast many specific national-level strategies for increasing inbound visitation, nor does it have a minister dedicated to tourism or travel.\n\nThe report also expanded on visitation levels, a metric in which the US fell to the third spot. In 2023, the country received 67 million visitors, whereas 79 million people visited in 2019. The country also received poor rankings in security and facilitation upon arrival, mainly due to lengthy wait times at the airport. Only 36% of the airports in the US utilize biometric entry and exit systems, the lack of which brings inefficiency to onboarding and off-boarding processes. One of the metrics in which the US performed extraordinarily well was global connectivity, as the country ranked at the top due to being a major hub for global connecting flights. The US also received one of the top rankings in the travel promotion category, which the Travel Association credited to Brand USA, a venture of public-private partnership meant to market the US travel industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some of the metrics do warrant praise for the US tourism industry, others painted a dire picture of its current state. On January 11, 2024, the US Travel Association revealed these findings as one of the critical reasons behind creating a new Commission for Seamless and Secure Travel. The Commission will be led by Kevin McAleenan, the former Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. It will include other former members of the government as well as experts from the private sector. The Commission's primary goal is to suggest policy recommendations that can foster tourism growth within the US, solving the issues pointed out in the Euromonitor report.

Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB), a leading short-term rental company, faced significant shifts in the year 2023. According to a Bloomberg report, published on August 10, 2023, available revenue per room in areas of Orlando and California dropped by 6.4% and 17%, respectively, in the first half of 2023. This led to a surge in online panic, with people questioning whether Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) is on its way to dying out. However, things are not that dire. On February 13, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported a positive surprise in its revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $2.22 billion and outperformed market expectations by $53.47 million.\n\nSearch for Cheaper Alternatives Amidst Rising Inflation\n\nOn February 13, Reuters reported that the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3% in January, whereas the year-on-year increase was 3.1%. As the rates of rent and other commodities increase, consumers flock towards cheaper alternatives in every segment of life, including travel and tourism. Families are searching for the best vacations on a budget, and websites such as Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) can provide valuable information in this scenario.\n\nNot only does the website provide useful information regarding tourist spots in every country around the world, it is also introducing new features to enhance customer experience. On February 21, Tableo, a restaurant reservation system, announced its partnership with Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP). Using the Tableo-integrated version of Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), travelers can easily reserve seats at any restaurant they want, affordable or otherwise. This partnership will also benefit the restaurants signed up with Tableo, as they will be able to access the reviews left on Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP).\n\nAmidst this backdrop of rising inflation and prices, potential travelers can benefit from discovering the best family vacations on a budget below $5,000.

After consulting over 10 online travel expert sources, we generated a list of budget vacation places that appeared in at least 50% of our sources. To further shortlist fifteen places, and rank them in order from most expensive to least, we utilized average rates for flights and night stays. We considered these two metrics because they tend to take up the highest chunk of any vacation\u2019s budget, whereas food, shopping, and entertainment costs vary depending on the trip you wish to take. Each place listed in this article has a range of dining options and activities, within every price budget.\n\nPlease note that the flight rate is per person, whereas the accommodation rate is for one room that can host two adults and two kids. For both these rates, Kayak was consulted. Flight fares are round-trip, with the starting location being Newark, New Jersey. For accommodation in particular, only 3-star+ lodgings were considered, with a minimum average rating of above 6. Also, note that both rates are from the time this article was written. These numbers are only meant to present a moderate idea of how affordable a place is. Depending on the tourist influx, each place on this list will be cheapest at a different time of the year.\n\nGoing by this methodology, here is our list of the 15 best family vacations for a budget lower than $5,000.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "Whitby is one of the areas where new holiday let mortgages will not be on offer - Danny Lawson/PA\n\nA building society will stop lending on new Airbnbs from next month in an effort to alleviate pressure placed on some of England\u2019s limited housing stock.\n\nIt comes as Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed plans to curb the number of new holiday lets in tourist hotspots by introducing the need for planning permission.\n\nLeeds Building Society today announced plans to stop handing out new mortgages to holiday let owners in North Norfolk and North Yorkshire for 12 months \u2013 starting from the end of March. Existing owners won\u2019t be affected.\n\nChief executive Richard Fearon said short-term lets have placed \u201ca significant stranglehold\u201d on the pipeline of new homes being built for local people and he is keen to remove it.\n\nThe building society boss added: \u201cWe will learn through the trial how effective this measure can be in increasing [the] supply of residential homes.\u201d\n\nBack in August 2022, the lender stopped issuing mortgages to second homeowners nationwide to help free up more homes for first-time buyers. It has since seen an uptick in first-time buyer customers \u2013 in the first half of 2023, they made up half of new lending business.\n\nNow, budding Airbnb owners eyeing up a property in North Norfolk \u2013 as well as in selected areas of North Yorkshire, including Scarborough, Whitby, Filey, Saltburn, Leyburn and Richmond \u2013 won\u2019t be able to get a loan from Leeds Building Society.\n\nThe lender has registered the postcodes on its system to prevent holiday let mortgage applications in those areas from being approved. If an owner wants to turn their property into an Airbnb part way through the year, they would need to apply for a \u2018consent to let\u2019.\n\nBoth North Norfolk District Council and North Yorkshire Council have cited ongoing housing pressures created by their popularity as tourist destinations.\n\nIn October, The Telegraph visited Blakeney in North Norfolk \u2013 a village where 44pc of all housing is either a second home or holiday let.\n\nLocals said they are having to live in such cramped areas now, and that many houses \u201care in darkness\u201d for much of the year. Across North Norfolk, there is a 2,500-household-long waiting list for affordable housing.\n\nStory continues\n\nNorth Norfolk District Council also wants to add a \u00a31 Paris-style tourist levy onto Airbnb bookings to help plug finances which have come under strain.\n\nAndy Fenner, chief executive of Short Term Accommodation Association, said Leeds Building Society\u2019s latest plans to restrict who it lends to will \u201chave no impact at all\u201d on freeing up homes for local people.\n\nInstead, he said it puts the tourism industry at risk and the thousands of jobs that rely on it in these communities.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt also perpetuates the misconception that the holiday let industry is somehow to blame for the housing crisis. Where there is higher demand for short-term rentals, they are responsible for jobs and tourism income. Why would you want to destroy that? These holiday lets aren\u2019t a luxury to the people and businesses who depend on them.\n\n\u201cThe lending restrictions cover such wide areas, they aren\u2019t targeted, and won\u2019t have the desired impact in any case. The irony is that much of the funding for new house building ultimately comes from this kind of mortgage lending in the first place, which they are now throttling.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Gove outlined new rules which will require new short-term let owners to secure planning permission from local authorities in a bid to stop them \u201chollowing out\u201d communities.\n\nThe rules won\u2019t, however, apply to those letting out their main home for 90 days or less each year.\n\nRecommended\n\nWhy Gove\u2019s housing shake-up will not fix Britain\u2019s property crisis\n\nRead more",

The market is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.8% from 2023 to 2032, reaching a value of $8.6 trillion at the conclusion of the predicted period. The main drivers of this expansion are the growing number of tourists travelling abroad and the rising standards of living of the general public. The rapid integration of big data analytics, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism is another factor driving the sector. However, the report points out that the leisure travel market can be significantly impacted by geopolitical unrest.\n\nIn terms of market share by age group segment in 2022, the 22\u201331 years segment was in the lead with a share of almost 32%. The report also mentions that, with a 38.7% market revenue share in 2022, Asia Pacific emerged as the largest global leisure travel market. The expansion of the market is anticipated to be driven by the increasing disposable income in the region, particularly in China and India.\n\nBuilding up on this, according to a global survey by Hilton and Ipsos of over 10,000 travelers from nine countries, the number one reason to travel in 2024 for most of the respondents was to rest and recharge with an emphasis on sleep. The survey also found that 64% of global travelers intend to prioritize leisure travel in 2024 by cutting back on other personal expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, travelers are focusing primarily on dining experiences while they budget for 2024, per Hilton. Exploration and adventure ranked second in importance among travelers (47%) after dining experiences, with Millennials and Gen Zers devoting a bigger percentage of their budget than other generations for these experiences.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Top 15 Luxury Travel Agencies in the World and 12 Best Travel Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThe survey further revealed that an astounding 80% of global travelers think it's essential to be able to plan their entire trip online, with 76% appreciating travel apps that reduce the friction and stress of travel.

        "content": "Airbnb aims to expand its Host Clubs, which numbered around 640 globally in late 2023. Source: Airbnb\n\nAirbnb has started to verify listings in five of its top global markets, but the process is much simpler for professional hosts than those with individual listings, according to requirements viewed by Skift.\n\nIn the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and France, the verification process for pro hosts consists of just checking two boxes indicating that their listings satisfy verification requirements and that they are authorized to attest to that. There is no other proof required.\n\nIndividual hosts need to provide photos or videos.\n\nProfessional hosts could be those with, say, 20 listings or public companies. such as Vacasa and Sonder with thousands.\n\nHosts who don\u2019t submit verification for their listings within several weeks after receiving an email prompting them to do so risk having their calendars blocked, meaning they can\u2019t take new reservations.\n\nAirbnb blocked or removed more than 200,000 fake listings in 2023. Now it is undertaking the mammoth task of verifying its more than 7 million listings. Airbnb, which declined to comment on the verification process for this story, is expected to provide an update in March about how many of its listings it has verified.\n\nHere\u2019s the process for individual hosts, according to Airbnb:\n\nTake photos outside their property that match two images or Provide three videos of less than 20 seconds each that the host takes inside the front door, outside the unit, and showing a street sign nearby or If the host doesn\u2019t reside in the listing city, then they can ask someone else to match two photos with listing images or submit the three videos.",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this company have returned +5.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb, Inc. belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Airbnb, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.30 per share, indicating a change of +66.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +23.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.60 points to a change of -36.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.28 indicates a change of +14.8% from what Airbnb, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Airbnb, Inc.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Airbnb, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $2.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.4%. The $11.08 billion and $12.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.8% and +11.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb, Inc. reported revenues of $2.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.6%. EPS of $0.76 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.57%. The EPS surprise was +13.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 12 Countries to Get Easy Work Visa in the World. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries to Get Easy Work Visa in the World.\n\nIn light of greater connectivity across countries through digitization, the concept of international work has gained momentum. This global village is now filled with diverse and innovative possibilities, ranging from self-employed work to jobs in almost all industries. The developed nations of the world have attracted expatriates for various reasons, with one of the strongest being better career prospects. Their economic growth has spurred the need for a larger workforce, especially one that is more qualified. However, it must also be kept in mind that extensive industrialization and mass production in developed countries have prompted them to explore alternative avenues for labor, including the international labor market. It is, then also not surprising that a great number of countries in the world exist that provide easy work visa.\n\nLabor Migration\n\nWhether low-skilled or high-skilled, labor migration has far-reaching impacts on both receiving and sending countries. Developed and emerging economies alike are in constant need of low-skilled workers, a demand expected to increase, while their countries of origin lack job opportunities. In 2021, there was a 26% increase in permanent migration in OECD countries, primarily attributed to the rise in labor migration due to labor and skill shortages. According to the Migration Data Portal, the year 2019 saw an estimated 169 million international migrant workers worldwide, accounting for 4.9% of the global labor force in destination countries. They also constituted 69% of the world\u2019s international migrant working-age population (15 years of age and above).\n\nIt is also noteworthy that high-income countries were the major recipients of this migration, hosting about two-thirds of all migrant workers. Other regions, including Northern, Southern, and Western Europe, accounted for a 24.2% share, Northern America received 22.1%, and 14.3% landed in the Arab States. While men constituted 58.5% of all labor migration, European areas saw a 50% share of women migrants. The report also highlighted a greater flow of migrants in the service sector (66.2%), followed by industry (26.7%) and agriculture (7.1%).\n\nStory continues\n\nJob Market for Skilled International Labor\n\nWith growing economies, the need for labor is bound to rise and therefore, there will be a lot of countries where work visa can be easily obtained. The 'land of opportunity,' the United States, has attracted foreign workers in large quantities over the years and continues to do so. As the largest economy in the world, the country offers many work visas. Sectors with the greatest demand for labor include IT and software, engineering, accounting and finance, STEM professions, and nursing, among others. Europe is also attracting a fair amount of immigrants due to labor shortages, especially in fields like medicine, and engineering. For example, the number of Indian immigrants working in engineering fields in Germany has grown by 558% in the past decade. Asian countries are also seeking workers in hospitality, IT, tourism, education, and engineering sectors, among others.\n\nIn the midst of such vast opportunities, the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) is yet another attraction for immigrants hoping to find work abroad. Sponsorship by the employing company can greatly facilitate the work visa process. Some of the best international companies to work for include Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB).\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) is an American multinational company and a prominent name in hotel, residential, and timeshare properties. The company boasts more than 30 brands and operates in 139 countries with over 8,700 properties. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) prioritizes maintaining a positive work culture and placing their people first. They are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusiveness in all their global enterprises.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and medical technologies corporation that continues to innovate and develop. Recently, the US FDA approved a bi-weekly dose of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE: JNJ) blood cancer therapy. The company has also been named the 2024 Fortune World\u2019s Most Admired Company.\n\nAirbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) is an online platform for hospitality services. The company provides a mobile app through which customers can list, discover, and book accommodations across countries. With a presence in various regions and countries, Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) is headquartered in California, USA. The company is renowned for its positive work culture and places a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusiveness, actively fostering such values. 12 Countries to Get Easy Work Visa in the World\n\n12 Countries to Get Easy Work Visa in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to compile our list for 12 Countries to Get Easy Work Visa in the World, we have scoured through various sources to shortlist countries that provide the easiest way for obtaining work visa.

        "content": "A legal battle rife with allegations of scandal and blackmail has erupted from what began as a routine Airbnb rental dispute. Shawn Mackey's stay at \"A Little Bit More Country,\" a quaint Airbnb property in Memphis, led to a chain of events that would unravel into a complex legal confrontation.\n\nIn September 2022, Mackey rented the Airbnb property. The understanding was that a few extra guests might join for dinner, to which host Pamela Fohler initially had no objections. However, the agreement turned acrimonious after Fohler imposed additional charges based on the number of guests, citing house rules. The situation was exacerbated by noise complaints from neighbors, prompting Fohler to request the group's departure.\n\nMackey negotiated to stay, but the incident left a sour note, prompting him to leave a negative review and request a partial refund of $502.46. Airbnb responded by suspending his account pending further investigation.\n\nFohler's communication took a darker turn, as she allegedly threatened to send security camera footage to Mackey's wife, implying infidelity. \"Photo at 3:16 AM is especially notable. Should I forward the photos and videos to [Mackey's wife] Teresa, or will you?\" her message read, according to the complaint reported by the New York Post. When Mackey refused to settle the $960 claimed by Fohler, the footage was reportedly sent to his wife.\n\nThe public reaction has been swift and decisive, with social media platforms like Instagram becoming arenas for discussion and debate. Users have condemned the alleged extortion and privacy invasion, with one comment stating this is \"extortion and invasion of privacy,\" suggesting that all of Fohler's properties should be put at risk through legal action. Other users have pointed out the gravity of the additional fees being labeled as \"hush money.\"\n\nLegal experts and commentators on social media have speculated about the potential repercussions for Fohler, with users predicting the loss of her Airbnb hosting rights and removal from hosting platforms. The case raises critical questions about the boundaries of privacy, the ethics of host-guest interactions and the responsibilities of platforms like Airbnb in mediating and policing such disputes.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the case proceeds, with Mackey seeking unspecified actual and punitive damages for the alleged damage to his marriage and emotional distress, Airbnb has moved to compel arbitration. In contrast, Fohler has filed a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nThe outcome of this legal entanglement may set a precedent for how digital privacy, hospitality services and personal conduct intersect in the increasingly scrutinized sharing economy.\n\nManaging an Airbnb property involves a myriad of challenges, from maintaining the property to adhering to local laws and taxes. Hosts must be proactive in managing their listings, ensuring properties are clean, dealing with guest communications and sometimes facing unpredictable income because of vacancies or seasonal changes.\n\nFor those looking for an alternative investment option with a less hands-on approach, platforms like Arrived offer a way to invest in real estate passively. Arrived Homes allows individuals to invest in rental properties typical challenges of direct property management.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

        "content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Activists want stricter regulations of short-term rentals in Puerto Rico as the U.S. territory sees a growing number of displaced renters and a spike in housing costs, the Hispanic Federation said in a report Wednesday.\n\nThe number of units operating as short-term rentals in Puerto Rico jumped to more than 25,000 in 2022 from about 1,000 in 2014, the report commissioned by the federation said.\n\nIt found that while short-term rentals create jobs, attract visitors and lead to more transportation options, renters have faced evictions, the cost of goods have increased amid an economic crisis and some ecological areas have been destroyed during new construction.\n\nThe report calls for creating a public registry of short-term rentals, classifying them as a business and increasing the island\u2019s room tax from 7% to up to 11% and using the additional revenue to develop affordable housing.\n\n\u201cThis has gotten to a point where the impacts are really palpable in Puerto Rico,\u201d Charlotte Gossett Navarro, the foundation\u2019s Puerto Rico chief director, said in an interview.\n\nA key factor in the increase of short-term rentals was Hurricane Maria, which pummeled the island in September 2017. Many people migrated to the U.S. mainland afterward, while scores of new investors came to the island to buy homes and properties.\n\nThat led to a reduction in housing availability and affordability, Gossett said, adding that other factors including the pandemic also are to blame.\n\nNow, between 100 to 400 new short-term rentals are reported a month in Puerto Rico, with apartments representing 60% of properties available for that purpose.\n\nDulce del R\u00edo-Pineda, who has lived 40 years on the island of Culebra just east of Puerto Rico, said she noticed a big change in the housing market in the past seven years with the influx of short-term rentals.\n\n\u201cIt's an economic benefit,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, our young people especially find themselves without any hope of being able to buy their own home. It's a way of making our community disappear.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 64-year-old former special education teacher who now helps to run a local nonprofit said social inequality also has become more dramatic. Some homes on Culebra, a popular tourist destination, now cost $4 million to $8 million.\n\nA recent study by the non-partisan Center for a New Economy and the Graduate School of Planning of the University of Puerto Rico found that a 10% rise in the number of short-term rentals in a community increases housing rental costs by 7% and the property value per square foot by 23%.\n\n\u201cWith so much to offer visitors, tourism will always be an important part of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy,\u201d said Frankie Miranda, the Hispanic Federation's CEO and president. \u201cHowever, it cannot come at the expense of Puerto Rico\u2019s residents and communities.\u201d\n\nActivists are calling for rent-control policies; restoring abandoned properties for long-term rentals; designating six or more rental units as a small inn; and designating areas where short-term rentals can operate to protect ecological and agricultural lands.\n\nVarious bills have proposed how short-term rentals should be operated. One still under consideration would, among other things, award regulation and oversight of such properties to municipalities.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that the conversation is already happening in the government,\u201d Gossett said. \u201cThere\u2019s an awareness that something needs to change.\u201d\n\nBut the new report noted that the bills do not address the impact of short-term rentals on housing, including displacement and gentrification.\n\nGossett noted that the study found a consensus that short-term rentals can be important for the island, and said the foundation is not seeking a ban on them.\n\nA day before the report was released, Airbnb issued a statement saying it supports the \u201cinclusive regulation\u201d of short-term rentals, which will have to be registered by early June if they\u2019re operating in the capital of San Juan.\n\nAirbnb, which has generated more than $70 million in room tax revenues for Puerto Rico and is behind the majority of the increase in short-term rentals, also had backed a bill that called for allocating 5% of room tax revenues to municipalities. Legislators voted against it in a move that some blamed on a \u201cpower game\u201d among lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, another bill is pending before legislators that would create a regulatory framework for short-term rentals at a national level. Given the lack of such a framework, the room tax is collected from Airbnb and other companies under an agreement with Puerto Rico's Tourism Company.",

        "title": "15 Best Side Hustles for Women Over 50",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 best side hustles for women over 50. We have also discussed the general experiences of women with side jobs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Side Hustles for Women Over 50.\n\nThe gig economy is flourishing as Gen Z earns the moniker \"Side Hustle Generation,\" with 53% juggling multiple incomes. However, women, especially, face major challenges. Despite comprising 50% of multitasking Millennials, they encounter disproportionate hurdles in navigating within this dynamic employment environment.\n\nThe workplace inclusion and diversity survey of 2023 revealed stark gender disparities: 24% of women lacked pay raises in the past year, contrasting with 15% of men. Men were twice as likely to receive monetary perks. Moreover, 67% of men earned a median salary of $55k or higher, while only 39% of women did. Consequently, 40% of women felt underpaid, compared to 24% of men.\n\nIt is, however, still worth noting that older women in the labor market have undergone major changes as data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics has revealed some shifts in employment dynamics. During the pandemic's peak, women aged 55 and above faced huge job losses, amounting to almost 3 million positions that essentially translated a 17% decline. However, recent trends indicate a stable recovery, attributed in part to the Biden administration's economic interventions. The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the CARES Act also played important roles in bolstering unemployment benefits and expanding access to crucial support programs, promoting a swift rebound in employment rates for older women. Speaking of employment, do check out 20 States with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\n\nLooking ahead, projections suggest a continued rise in older women's participation in the workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts growth in this demographic's employment between 2020 and 2030, with workers aged 65 and over driving more than 60% of labor force expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis trend is also bidding farewell to some older patterns, as older individuals increasingly contribute to economic productivity. However, despite these increases, older women are also struggling with a plethora of challenges, including larger gender wage gaps and barriers to labor force attachment. Structural inequalities, compounded by factors such as ageism and occupational segregation, persist.\n\nWhile many people wonder how to make money at age of 50, the US Census Bureau reveals, 18.4% of workers aged 65 and above are self-employed. Retired individuals are increasingly embracing entrepreneurship, often leveraging their hobbies for income generation. Whether through crafting, consulting, or online endeavors, retirees can capitalize on their interests to establish successful enterprises. Hence, side hustles for seniors are now becoming a common sight in the US. For the elderly, selling stock photos and transcribing audio are side hustles that can pay $3000 a month.\n\nTwo of the major players in the side hustles for women are Upwork, Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) and Airbnb, Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB). We shall be discussing their relevance in the jobs below.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best side hustles for women over 50, we tried priorizing hustles with three main qualities keeping in mind the experience, physical health, and schedules of a person of such an age. Firstly, we tried to look for side hustles that are flexible with working hours and adaptable schedules, Secondly, we tried to target jobs or side hustles that demanded less physical activity. Lastly, we tried to look for side jobs that could capitalize on the already established skillset of people of this age with rich learning experiences.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy to Beat the Market This Week",
        "content": "During the week of February 12-16, we talked about three stocks to watch, Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), to gain insights into broader market trends and potentially benefit. As the earnings season peaks, we explore three stocks to buy this week, and we explain the reasons behind it.\n\nThe relatively heavy economic data published last week, including the U.S. CPI and Retail Sales figures, has added market volatility. It also seemed that the U.S. economy would avoid a recession, a positive catalyst for those looking for stocks to buy this week. Both events bolstered investor sentiment despite rising bond yields.\r\n\r\nLast week also caught the market somewhat broadening out beyond its largest constituents. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained strong momentum, implying overall optimism. This provided another sign for those risk-on investors looking for stocks to buy in the small-cap space.\r\n\r\nThe February 19 \u2013 23 earnings calendar may be fairly light, leaving direction in the hands of the remainder of corporate earnings reports. A primary focus for those scouting stocks to buy will be tech giant Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) widely anticipated earnings release. Investors may secure some of their profits ahead or post-announcement, inducing downward pressure on its stock price. However, a solid quarterly report would probably help lift the broader market.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Nvidia, where earnings could prompt upward or downward momentum, a few other stocks to buy could present interesting opportunities. Solid earnings may help offset potential increased volatility should the last of the Magnificent 7 fail to catalyze further upside across markets.\u200b\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), the prominent coffee company, could be one of the stocks to buy this week. The company presents an interesting investment opportunity during a week anticipated to focus substantially on tech news. Despite the company\u2019s earnings results at the beginning of February missing analyst estimates, investors initially helped push the stock price higher. Yet, during the subsequent period following the release, its stock price declined below the level it stood at during the announcement. However, SBUX\u2019s retracement has not coincided with any adjustment to its underlying fundamentals.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company reported increased profits of 20% year-on-year (YOY) and maintained a generous dividend policy. This suggests its stock price may stabilise as investors refocus beyond the immediate post-earnings reaction.\r\n\r\nStarbucks currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.9x, below the 27.2x of the S&P 500 Index. Analysts have established an average price target of $107.15, representing a 15% potential upside.\u200b\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) stocks to buy, Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) could be one of the more intriguing opportunities this week as optimism in the tech sector remains buoyant. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday. Its stock price has risen in anticipation of the earnings release, and if the optimism continues, it could still be one of the stocks to buy not just for this week but also the following.\r\n\r\nDespite the bottom line growing some 66% in the previous quarter, the market reacted negatively to disappointing forward revenue guidance. Therefore, guidance will likely be a key focus this time around. Analysts forecast EPS growth of 24% to $1.30, with revenues increasing 19% to $1.97 billion. Notably, Palo Alto has a track record of exceeding analyst estimates by an average of 20% or more.\n\nLennar (LEN) Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screen\n\nSource: madamF via Shutterstock\n\nHomebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN) could be the last of the stocks to buy this week after seeing its share price drop in the wake of the CPI data released last week. It suggested that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may maintain higher interest rates and, therefore, mortgage prices would increase. However, with easing yields, its stock price could stage a rebound.\n\nAn even bigger catalyst for the construction company may be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) upcoming earnings report at the end of the week. This is because Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, has been accumulating homebuilder stock lately, including a $21.4 million stake in Lennar. While a small portion of his overall investment portfolio, the renowned investor\u2019s interest in the company implies it may have growth potential as the U.S. continues grappling with a sizable housing deficit of 3.1 million units.\r\n\r\nLennar currently trades at a P/E ratio of just 10.9x while holding a $6.3 billion cash reserve to invest in new opportunities. The company increased its cash holdings by $1.7 billion since last year, which makes it an even more compelling stock to buy this week.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "What are the proposals to restrict short-term lets in England?",
        "content": "Lerryn in Cornwall. Local people struggle to find somewhere to live in the county because many properties are let short-term for holidays rather than as homes.Photograph: Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nNew rules for short-term holiday lets in England were unveiled by the government on Monday, with the aim of reining in a sector that campaigners claim is \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\nAmid growing concern about an explosion in the number of properties being let out on a short-term basis, leading to local residents being pushed out of their communities, ministers are proposing to introduce a registration scheme for holiday lets, and will also require them to get planning permission.\n\nHowever, many campaigners say the planned changes do not go nearly far enough.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nIn recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people turning their properties into holiday rentals and short-term lets. A lot of this has been fuelled by the ubiquity of platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com that arguably make it easy to do this as a potentially lucrative and often largely unregulated side hustle.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic then turbo-charged this trend because it triggered a boom in domestic holidays and short breaks \u2013 something that has continued during the cost of living crisis.\n\nAt the same time a less favourable tax regime for buy-to-let following changes made in 2015 has meant many landlords and investors have left that sector and switched to catering to tourists \u2013 particularly in popular destinations such as the Lake District and Cornwall.\n\nThe result of all this, said campaign group Generation Rent, was that \u201cfamilies are being driven out of their communities by the disastrous loss of homes into holiday lets, with over 35,000 privately rented homes lost to Airbnb-style short-term lets since 2019\u201d.\n\nRegistered holiday lets and second homes have an arguably negligible effect on housing supply across England, accounting for 26,000 properties compared with the 682,000 new homes added to the nation\u2019s housing stock over 2019-22. However, the effect they do have is highly concentrated: 80% of the recent growth in holiday homes has happened in 25 local council areas.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is also the issue of antisocial behaviour linked to short-term lets, such as fly-tipping, bags of rubbish and noisy parties.\n\nWhat has the government announced?\n\nIt has acknowledged there is a problem. The housing secretary, Michael Gove, said on Monday that in some areas \u201ctoo many local families and young people feel they are being shut out of the housing market and denied the opportunity to rent or buy in their own community\u201d.\n\nIt has been consulting on this issue and has now announced a shake-up of the rules in England.\n\nThere are two main proposals. Planning permission will be required for future short-term lets, which the government argues will give councils more power to \u201ccontrol\u201d them. The proposed changes would create a planning \u201cuse class\u201d for short-term lets that are not used as a sole or main home.\n\nMeanwhile, a mandatory national register will be set up to provide local authorities with information on short-term lets in their area and, in theory, enable them to monitor their use, the impact on the local area and whether health and safety rules are being met.\n\nMore detailed information will be set out by ministers in the coming months, and the government said the reforms would be introduced \u201cfrom this summer\u201d.\n\nI sense a \u2018but\u2019 \u2026\n\nSo yes, while many commentators were happy to see the government taking action, some pointed out omissions or what they argued were sizeable flaws in the shake-up.\n\nThe \u201cfuture short-term lets\u201d aspect of the first proposal is important: the government said existing short-term lets \u201cwill automatically be reclassified into the new use class and will not require a planning application\u201d. Generation Rent said that allowing existing holiday lets to automatically gain permission to continue \u201crisks shutting the stable door once the horse has bolted\u201d and would do nothing about the thousands of homes that had already been lost.\n\nMeanwhile, ministers said homeowners would still be able to let out their own home for up to 90 nights a year without planning permission. The government had been looking at whether there should be a limit of 30, 60 or 90 nights a year.\n\nOn top of this, the government also said it was looking at how to ensure the register \u201cdoes not apply disproportionate regulation \u2013 for example on property owners that let out their home infrequently\u201d.\n\nThe fact that the government announcement included a positive quote from Airbnb welcoming the register as \u201cgood news for everyone\u201d was seized on by some commentators, with Jonathan Eley of the Financial Times posting on X that it \u201ctells you everything you need to know about the pointlessness of the legislation\u201d.\n\nAren\u2019t some areas already cracking down on holiday lets?\n\nYes. In Scotland, for example, new rules took effect on 1 October last year. There, people must have a licence before they offer short-term lets, and operating without one is a criminal offence: you could get a fine of \u00a32,500 and be banned from applying for a licence for a year. The rules apply even if someone occasionally lets out their spare room or sublets their property while on holiday.\n\nWhat do campaigners say needs to be done?\n\nGroups such as Generation Rent say the government should rethink its approach and give councils the power to require holiday lets to join a licensing scheme.\n\nIt has also called for the introduction of local caps on the number of holiday lets that can operate in an area \u2013 particularly those locations with especially serious housing affordability problems.\n\nThere is already precedent for a national licensing regime. A fairly strict one is in place for larger private rented homes \u2013 large houses in multiple occupation \u2013 in England and Wales.",

        "content": "LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Britain plans to change rules on short-term lets to protect local residents from being pushed out of their communities by excessive temporary accommodation, it said on Monday, with implications for platforms such as Airbnb.\n\nThe government said it would give local councils greater power to control short-term lets by making them subject to the planning process, in addition to introducing a mandatory national host register.\n\nThe changes form part of a plan to prevent a \"hollowing out\" of communities, address anti-social behaviour and ensure local people can continue to live in their locality, the statement added.\n\nAirbnb, which has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007, has drawn criticism from some users as well as hosts for not doing enough to ensure safety.\n\nCities including Amsterdam and London have capped the number of nights that premises can be let on short-let platforms to protect local communities.\n\nAmanda Cupples, General Manager for Airbnb's Northern Europe division, said the company had led calls for the introduction of a host register.\n\n\"Families who host on Airbnb will benefit from clear rules that support their activity, and local authorities will get access to the information they need to assess and manage housing impacts and keep communities healthy, where necessary,\" she said.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has over 5 million hosts across the world, its website says.\n\nThe planning changes and the register will not affect hotels, hostels or bed and Bed and Breakfasts (B&Bs), the government added.

        "content": "In this piece we will look at the 20Cheapest Countries To Fly To, and in case you want to skip our detailed analysis of the tourism industry and its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, you can go directly to 5 Cheapest Countries To Fly To.\n\nThe travel industry has shown resilience in overcoming the challenges brought on by the pandemic. It has been almost four years since the pandemic began in March 2020, resulting in travel restrictions and a decline in consumer interest in travel. However, experts predict that the industry will fully recover by 2024.\n\nIn 2023, international travel experienced a significant uptick, with international arrivals reaching 88% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, according to data from the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported that international arrivals surpassed 2022 levels in all regions. This positive trend is expected to continue into 2024, with several regions surpassing 2019 levels by the end of the year.\n\nThe increase in international arrivals to an estimated 1.3 billion reflects pent-up demand, improved air connectivity, and a stronger recovery in Asian markets. The Middle East, on the other hand, saw the most significant relative recovery, surpassing pre-pandemic levels by 22%. Europe, the most visited region globally, achieved 94% of 2019 levels, driven by regional demand and travel from the United States. Moreover, Africa recovered 96% of pre-pandemic visitors, while the Americas reached 90%. In Asia and the Pacific, regions like South Asia and North-East Asia saw varying levels of recovery, with South Asia leading at 87% of 2019 levels.\n\nIn 2023, preliminary estimates show that international tourism receipts amounted to USD 1.4 trillion, which is approximately 93% of the USD 1.5 trillion earned by destinations in 2019. Furthermore, the total export revenues from tourism, including passenger transport, were estimated at USD 1.6 trillion in 2023, representing nearly 95% of the USD 1.7 trillion recorded in 2019. Additionally, preliminary estimates indicate that the economic contribution of tourism, as measured by tourism direct gross domestic product (TDGDP), reached USD 3.3 trillion in 2023, accounting for 3% of global GDP. This signals a recovery of pre-pandemic TDGDP driven by robust domestic and international tourism activities.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn looking ahead to 2024, analysts predict that technology will play a vital role in driving innovation and transformation within the travel and tourism sector. They emphasize the significance of digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics in reshaping the industry. Moreover, the widespread adoption of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is anticipated to elevate travel experiences by allowing travellers to virtually visit destinations from the comfort of their homes before confirming their travel arrangements.\n\nA global study, which surveyed 27,000 travellers in 33 countries, including the UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, the US, and Latin America, reveals that travellers are navigating a balance between budget constraints and luxury desires. Some interesting findings include that 47% are considering taking their children out of school for off-peak travel, 46% are planning to reduce tips, and 50% intend to pay for trips using credit cards to manage costs. Despite the focus on budget-conscious decisions in 2024, travellers are still finding ways to indulge in luxury without breaking the bank. For example, 34% are open to borrowing designer clothes and accessories from family or friends for their trips.\n\nOn the other hand, the luxury travel sector is experiencing a 14% decline compared to previous forecasts, possibly indicating a shift towards more meaningful experiences and a re-evaluation of spending habits. 2024 introduces a new trend among European travellers, with a focus on shorter trips lasting 3-4 nights but with a higher daily budget. This shift suggests a preference for quality over quantity, with travellers opting for luxurious, shorter stays rather than longer trips on a stretched budget. This trend towards \"micro-cations\" emphasizes creating memorable and valuable experiences in a condensed timeframe. Moreover, Skiplagging, or commonly referred to as \"hidden city flights,\" has gained popularity as a money-saving tactic for air travelers in recent times.\n\nUndeniably, there seems to be seen a noticeable trend in the market, as consumers increasingly seek affordable options for their travel arrangements.\n\nNow before we delve into our list of 20 Cheapest Countries To Fly To, let us also first analyze what\u2019s happening around the key stakeholders of the travel industry. Namely, we are going to discuss Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQGS:MAR), Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQGS:ABNB) and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQGS:BKNG).\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQGS:MAR)\n\nMarriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR), a company with a diverse portfolio of approximately 30 brands and 1.6 million rooms spanning luxury, full service, and limited-service tiers, has shown impressive growth and financial stability. Its key brands, such as Marriott, Courtyard, and Sheraton, along with newer lifestyle brands like Autograph and Moxy, contribute to its success.\n\nFor the quarter ending 31 December 2023, the company reported a 7.2% increase in worldwide Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), with a significant 17.4% rise in international markets and a 3.3% increase in the U.S. & Canada. Adjusted net income for the quarter rose to $1,055 million from $622 million the previous year, while adjusted EBITDA reached $1,197 million. Despite the addition of nearly 81,300 rooms globally and strong growth internationally, Marriott faces the ongoing challenge of sustaining growth in a competitive and evolving travel and leisure industry.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQGS:ABNB)\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQGS:ABNB) operates an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experiences. In the fourth quarter ending 31 Decemeber 2023, the company recorded a gross booking value of $15.5 billion. The number of nights and experiences booked totalled 98.8 million, marking a 12% increase from the previous year and surpassing analysts' expectations. Airbnb noted a strong demand from guests, especially first-time users. Despite some volatility caused by external events, such as the Israel-Hamas conflict in October, Airbnb's business gained momentum throughout the quarter.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Airbnb's revenue increased by 17% from $1.9 billion compared to the same period the previous year. The company reported adjusted earnings of $738 million, exceeding analysts' expectations of $645 million. However, Airbnb faced a net loss of $349 million or 55 cents per share, contrasting with a net income of $319 million or 48 cents per share in the previous year, primarily due to lodging tax reserves and nonrecurring tax withholding expenses totaling approximately $1 billion.\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQGS:BKNG)\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQGS:BKNG) is a travel technology company headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. The company, incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law, owns and manages various travel fare aggregators and metasearch engines, including popular platforms like Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, Rentalcars.com, Momondo, and OpenTable. Operating in approximately 40 languages and across 200 countries, Booking Holdings Inc. serves a global audience.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023 ending 30 September 2023, customers reserved 276 million room nights, showing a noteworthy 15% year-over-year increase. Gross bookings amounted to $40 billion, marking a 24% year-over-year increase. These figures set new quarterly records, surpassing the expectations and indicating sustained high demand for travel. In the third quarter of 2023, the international component of total room nights exceeded 50%, up from approximately 45% in the same period of 2022. Travelers are making bookings further in advance, suggesting that the trend of prioritizing travel over other discretionary expenses will likely continue into the coming year. 20 Cheapest Countries To Fly To\n\nPhoto by Ovidiu Gruescu on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 Cheapest Countries To Fly To, we first extensively researched across various sources which listed Cheapest Countries To Fly To, and based on a consensus approach, we shortlisted more than 25 countries which appeared most frequently across all sources.

That was confirmed in this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), both coming in above Wall Street estimates (notably the \"core\" readings).\n\nIt has also been confirmed by Corporate America, provided you are doing your daily due diligence.\n\nSo many companies have told the investing masses this earnings cycle that margins are still being hurt by high levels of inflation, including beverage giants PepsiCo (PEP) and Coca-Cola (KO), among others.\n\nThe second component is that the US economy is slowing down. Not falling off a cliff, but looking unlikely to spring a surprise upside in the near term.\n\nWhile Wall Street played down the soft retail sales report this week, I would push back and suggest consumers and businesses are growing more cautious.\n\nDiscretionary apparel companies VF Corp (VFC) and Levi's (LEVI) have laid eggs on earnings within the past two weeks.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) CEO Peter Kern told us on Yahoo Finance Live that travel demand in the first quarter has slowed, partially leading to his company's below-expected guidance last week. We got similar language from Airbnb (ABNB) on its earnings call this week and with its first quarter guidance.\n\nCisco (CSCO) said Thursday it would slash 5% of its workforce as it's seeing clients \u2014 such as telecom firms \u2014 delay new orders.\n\nElevator and escalator maker Otis Worldwide (OTIS) told investors at a gathering at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday that it projects new equipment sales to be flat to up low single digits in the \"medium term.\" (I will note Otis had a good investor day, outlining a new $8 billion capital return plan \u2014 more on that in my interview above with Otis chair and CEO Judy Marks.)\n\nStory continues In terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty... It's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations.\n\nOverall conclusion: Inflation is still on an upswing while economic growth is on a downswing, and Fed policy is caught in a vortex of being unable to cut rates to support growth acceleration.\n\nRemember it was just Jan. 1, 2024, when many on the Street thought March would bring the first of potentially six rate cuts this year.\n\nAnd there is your theme change, and why investors have reacted harshly to the inflation numbers. The mix of sticky inflation, slowing economic growth, and uncertain Fed policy will add volatility to both equities and fixed income markets.\n\n\"A solid economy should continue to support earnings growth, but higher rates will likely also serve to cap valuation expansion,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner said in a client note.\n\nSome basics questions to be asking right now:\n\nIs this the start of a market correction? If so, how should I be preparing my portfolio of investments? Is this all overblown and I should not make any drastic changes to my portfolio? How can I develop a diversified portfolio that withstands the inevitable market volatility in 2024? Are we getting a sampling of how the market will be reacting as Election Day gets closer?\n\nOf course, Nvidia (NVDA) could come out next week with earnings and blow everyone away, sending broader markets higher. In the meantime, the data is telling us things have changed \u2014 and it should be respected.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "2 Stocks Down 32% and 90% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The market's doldrums of 2022 have turned into durable tailwinds. The S&P 500 index has gained 20% over the last year, and fears of a recession that never arrived have given way to an official bull market.\n\nBut not every long-term winner has gotten the bullish memo yet, so savvy investors should be keeping an eye out for potentially undervalued growth stocks. Right now, Fiverr International(NYSE: FVRR) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) stand out as two of the best investment ideas in Wall Street's bargain bin.\n\nFiverr: A hidden gem in the gig economy's crown\n\nAnders Bylund (Fiverr International): In the rapidly evolving gig economy, Fiverr International stands out for its resilience but also for its remarkable potential for long-term growth. Amid a bustling marketplace of freelance platforms, Fiverr's strategic position and innovative approach pave the way for its sustainable expansion, yet it also sports a valuation that might raise eyebrows for its modesty.\n\nFiverr's top line has increased by 86% over the past three years. Its free cash flow quintupled over the same span. However, Wall Street's market makers ignored these healthy business trends. Instead, Fiverr's recent stock price action has been inspired by its negative earnings and the deeply mistaken idea that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic would spell the end of the company's growth.\n\nSo long-term Fiverr shareholders have taken a 90% haircut in three years. These days, the shares change hands at the modest valuations of 3.4 times sales, 19 times free cash flows, and 14 times forward earnings estimates. Yes, the same Wall Street pros who brushed off Fiverr's cash-based success in recent years have changed their tune with downright bullish bottom-line estimates for 2024.\n\nIt's about time, too. I'm inspired by the company's relentless pursuit of innovation. From the launch of Fiverr Enterprise, designed to streamline corporate freelance engagements, to the introduction of AI-driven tools like the Fiverr Neo chatbot, the platform is continually being upgraded to meet the dynamic needs of its global user base. These advancements not only enhance user experience for both buyers and providers of freelance services, but also expand its market reach. Like any classic high-tech growth legend, Fiverr is laying the foundation for future revenue streams on a rich layer of research and development.\n\nStory continues\n\nFiverr's modest valuation, robust growth prospects, and strategic innovations add up to a compelling case for growth investors. In a changing world where flexibility and digital solutions are increasingly paramount, its blueprint for growth seems custom-built for the opportunities ahead. This gig economy crown jewel is shining brightly, even if mass-market investors haven't noticed yet. For those paying attention, Fiverr offers a golden opportunity to invest in the flexible future of work.\n\nAirbnb stock still has huge long-term potential\n\nKeith Noonan (Airbnb): Even though the broader market might not be in love with the stock right now, Airbnb has continued to grow its revenues at a solid double-digit percentage clip and record impressive margins. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 17% year over year to $2.2 billion. That performance pushed the company's full-year revenue to $9.9 billion -- up 18% from 2022. Meanwhile, the business closed out the year with free cash flow of $3.8 billion -- 39% of total sales for the period.\n\nDespite serving up strong business results, Airbnb's share price actually slumped on the heels of its fourth-quarter earnings release. The travel specialist's share price is also still down roughly 32% from its high.\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $95 billion, the company is valued at roughly 25 times trailing free cash flow. While that's still a growth-dependent valuation, it's one that I think will come to look cheap with the passage of time.\n\nThe rental leader now has more than 5 million property hosts on its platform and 7.7 million property listings around the world, but the business still has plenty of room for expansion over the long term. Airbnb is making moves to drive adoption in countries where its business is still in its early stages. Management has also indicated that the company is gearing up to expand into new service categories.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see the company begin to offer flight bookings, car rentals, or other travel-related offerings through its platform. If so, it's possible that Airbnb will be able to offer discounted bundle pricing that winds up being a big draw for users.\n\nCrucially, Airbnb has fantastic brand strength, best-in-class technology resources, and a large global user base. These foundations should help the company bridge itself into new business verticals. With zero debt and $10.1 billion in cash and equivalents on the books at the end of last year, the business also has a great balance sheet to work with.\n\nAirbnb's business is performing better and has greater opportunities than its stock price reflects -- and investors can take advantage of the disconnect.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Airbnb made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 12, 2024\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in Fiverr International.

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "The markets have dealt with several headwinds over the past few years, yet the S&P 500 has pushed through all that turmoil and is again posting new highs. It's another reminder that, regardless of how the markets perform in the near term, investors will eventually be rewarded for holding shares of growing companies.\n\nThe long-term performance of a stock is highly correlated with the growth of the underlying business. With that in mind, let's look at three stock picks that Motley Fool contributors believe would make great additions to a long-term investor's portfolio right now.\n\nMercadoLibre: A perennially undervalued growth stock\n\nJohn Ballard: One way to grow your money is to look for companies with high growth and plenty of growth runway still ahead. There's not many stocks that fit this criteria better than the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI).\n\nA $1,000 investment in the stock 10 years ago would be worth over $17,000 right now. And the same factors that contributed to that growth are still in play. MercadoLibre reported accelerating revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023, growing 69% year over year on a constant-currency basis.\n\nThe company is posting such strong growth primarily because e-commerce penetration in three of its largest markets -- Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina -- is growing at high rates. Retail e-commerce sales across Latin America are projected to reach over $200 billion in 2028, according to Statista, up from just $41 billion in 2017. That's a massive tailwind for the company.\n\nAfter investing in its core marketplace business and fintech offerings for many years, the company is also starting to show an improving profit margin. This is a major catalyst to push the stock higher in the near term. Operating income reached $685 million in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 194% on a constant-currency basis.\n\nThe stock still trades 14% below its previous peak from a few years ago. Investors can expect the stock to hit new highs in the years to come and deliver wealth-building returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbnb: This could be the online rental platform's best year yet\n\nJeremy Bowman: Airbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB) is no stranger to controversy, as the company has been criticized since its early days for taking housing stock away from local residents and operating as an illegal hotel business. More recently, joking criticism about Airbnb cleaning fees and chore lists has become something of a meme online.\n\nHowever, it seems as though Airbnb is getting the last laugh. The company just reported a fourth quarter with a 17% year-over-year increase in revenue to $2.22 billion, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin improved from 27% to 33%.\n\nAirbnb also has adapted its product and business model to satisfy most of the complaints it's faced. The company changed its pricing display so that guests see the total price upfront, eliminating the bait-and-switch feeling of the cleaning fees. Since it made that move, nearly 300,000 listings have removed or lowered their cleaning fees, and 40% of its active listings now charge no cleaning fee at all.\n\nThe company is also growing its supply at a brisk pace, putting to rest concerns of over-saturation that some had dubbed an \"Airbnbust.\" It topped 5 million hosts for the first time, and total listings rose 18% year over year to 7.7 million active listings, with particularly strong growth in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions.\n\nAirbnb has also tamed the regulatory threat, as 80% of its markets had some form of regulation in place as of the end of the year. In New York City, where a strict ban on short-term rentals passed, the company found that stays in nearby areas like New Jersey spiked, and New York hosts have shifted to long-term stays. No city accounts for more than 2% of its revenue, showing how diversified the company is geographically.\n\nFinally, Airbnb promised it would expand beyond the core this year, adding new products. The company will provide more details later in the year, but that could give the stock a jolt just as the broader business is building momentum.\n\nAmazon: One of the greatest investments of all time\n\nJennifer Saibil: After a rough 2022, 2023 got investors excited again about Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and its latest earnings update demonstrated incredible progress. The tech giant is back onto its regularly scheduled growth path after a few bumps over the past two years. Sales increased 14% year over year in the 2023 fourth quarter to $170 billion, and they were up 12% for the full year to $575 billion. After reporting its first annual net loss in a decade in 2022 (a drop of $2.7 billion), Amazon completely wiped that out with $30 billion in net income in 2023.\n\nCore e-commerce is back in action, with faster delivery times to its more than 200 million Prime members. That's a breathtaking amount of people who rely on Amazon for their essentials, and as Amazon wows them and wins their loyalty by offering what's probably an unmatched selection of merchandise faster than anywhere else, they're likely to keep coming back.\n\nAmazon Web Service (AWS) is holding steady, with revenue increasing 12% over last year in the fourth quarter. Although that's still below its pre-inflation rates, management says that trends are moving in the right direction. It continues to ink long-range deals with companies like Nvidia and Salesforce. It has also launched an ambitious array of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to stay competitive and keep its dominant position in cloud computing, where it has 31% of the market.\n\nAdvertising is its fastest-growing segment right now, increasing 26% year over year in the fourth quarter, and that's likely to remain a high-growth category. It's a no-brainer business, as third-party sellers can find buyers when they're looking to buy, and they benefit from Amazon's top-notch AI, which brings the right product ads to the right shoppers.\n\nAmazon stock is up 70% over the past year, and it has plenty of growth drivers to keep growing and gaining.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and MercadoLibre made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 12, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "Airbnb Still Isn't Threatened By Marriott And Hilton",
        "content": "Marriott International, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ: MAR)\u00a0is the world\u2019s largest hotelier. But, it is challenged by its close rival,\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE: HLT)\u00a0and both had their worlds shaken by\u00a0Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ: ABNB) that won its place in the travel industry. Although it reported solid fourth quarter earnings, Airbnb cautioned of moderate growth in the current quarter due to a tough comparison to 2023\u2019s comparable quarter when bookings rose 19%. Last week, Hilton also guided for a lower-than-expected 2024 profit forecast as travel demand is expected to normalize and this week, Marriott also followed suit with a 2024 guidance below Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nAirbnb Is Focused On Its International Expansion And AI-Enhancements\n\nOn Wednesday, Airbnb delivered better-than-expected sales but also warned of moderating growth in bookings.With revenue that grew 17% to\u00a0$2.22 billion,\u00a0Airbnb topped FactSet\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$2.17 billion\u00a0but\u00a0an\u00a0adjusted loss of 55 centsper share\u00a0came short of\u00a066 cents\u00a0per share that FactSet estimated. Net loss\u00a0totaled\u00a0$349 million\u00a0or\u00a0$489 million\u00a0when\u00a0adjusted\u00a0for charges. Gross bookings rose 13% YoY to\u00a0$15.5 billion\u00a0with total listings\u00a0increasing\u00a018% to 7.7 million\u00a0with Airbnb observing a\u00a0\"double-digit supply growth across all regions,\u00a0with the strongest being in\u00a0Asia Pacific and Latin America.\u00a0Airbnb continues to expand its focus on international markets\u00a0and focus on adding AI-powered\u00a0features to offer personalized experiences. For example, Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: BKNG) already introduced AI-powered features to enhance its booking and trip planning offerings, its key growth catalyst. In simple words, Booking and Airbnb seem to plan on using AI to create the ultimate digital concierge.\n\nAirbnb also mentioned its progress on making pricing more transparent as cleaning feels often killed the buzz of its deals. Upon its earnings release, Airbnb stated that almost 40% of active listings no longer charge cleaning fees as\u00a0almost 300,000 listings have removed or lowered\u00a0them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbnb guided for\u00a0current quarter revenue between\u00a0$2.03 billion and $2.07 billion, topping FactSet\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$2.02 billion.\n\nMarriott And Hilton Continue To Grow But They Are Not Threatening Airbnb\n\nMarriott\u00a0gathered\u00a0196 million members in its loyalty program\u00a0that grew\u00a010.7%\u00a0and compared to Hilton, its program is bigger and being used more.\u00a0Hilton grew its program more quickly\u00a0at 19% YoY, but\u00a0from a relatively smaller base, and it got to\u00a0180 million\u00a0loyalty\u00a0members. Interestingly, both hotel giants are less global than they imply. US made 78% of both Hilton\u2019s and Marriott\u2019s revenue in 2023.\u00a0Although they could argue\u00a0U.S. has some of the highest room rates in the world and one of the strongest currencies, U.S. holds\u00a070% of Hilton\u2019s\u00a0and\u00a067% of Marriott\u2019s\u00a0room count.\n\nHilton\u2019s revenue was fueled by\u00a0higher licensed fees and the\u00a0rebound of\u00a0group and convention travel. With\u00a0greater\u00a0occupancy\u00a0in the Asia Pacific region as well as higher room rates in the Middle East and Africa region, room revenue rose 5.7%\u00a0YoY.\u00a0Meanwhile, demand in the U.S. was flat with difficult YoY comparisons. But, expenses rose 13.8% during the fourth quarter to\u00a0$2.2 billion. With revenue of\u00a0$2.60 billion\u00a0that was in line with Wall Street estimates,adjusted per-share earnings of $1.68 beat\u00a0topped LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.57.\n\nMarriott reported its quarterly profit rose almost 27% to $848 million but its stock tanked 4.9% on Tuesday upon its latest report as revenue that rose to\u00a0$6.1 billion\u00a0came short of estimates, despite having recovered to exceed pre-COVID-19 levels from 2019, before the pandemic halted travel.\n\nHowever, when it comes to their vacation rental businesses, Hilton avoided the alternative accommodations segment and Marriott didn\u2019t need to materially report the figures in its\u00a010-K\u00a0due to a negligible amount of revenue and earnings. However, Marriott did comment it is encountering strong competition in the short-term lodging market, acknowledging the threat from Airbnb.\n\nAirbnb continues to be a threat in Marriott's and Hilton's shoes and for now, it isn't threatened by their short-term lodging offerings.

        "content": "Airbnb (ABNB) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of online accommodations platform Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) jumped 6.5% in the afternoon session on continued\u00a0optimism two days after the company reported solid fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' gross bookings and revenue expectations on better-than-expected 'Nights & Experiences Booked' (a key volume metric). Adjusted EBITDA also beat. Looking ahead, the company guided to adjusted EBITDA margins of \"at least 35%\" due to investments in \"incremental growth opportunities,\" below expectations of a margin slightly over 36%. Bulls would argue that with better-than-expected demand, the company should be investing to take share and build the brand. Bears may argue that lower margins are always a negative.\n\nSeparately, Airbnb's peer, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), also reported strong earnings results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations for revenue and EPS.\n\nThese results continued to highlight the solid demand for travel services. During Airbnb's Q4'2023 earnings call, management highlighted this, with the quarter recording the highest growth rate of the year for first-time bookers. As a result, Airbnb reiterated its focus on investing in under-penetrated international markets, with plans for expansion in Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. There is also the longer term bull case that the company is an AI beneficiary, with the technology helping the company improve customers' experiences in lodging discovery and search.\n\nIs now the time to buy Airbnb? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nAirbnb's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 12 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago, when the stock gained 5% on the news that the company revealed plans to increase fees charged to guests for cross-currency bookings. This means that whenever a guest pays for a booking using a different currency from the one set by the host, there would be an additional fee of as much as 2%. The company noted that the additional fee could result in a guest service fee of up to 16.5% of the booking subtotal.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore important than the details of the fees associated with cross-currency bookings is the bigger-picture international volume opportunity. This news is likely increasing bullishness among investors that Airbnb is focused on expanding into new markets to meet the growing demand for its offerings. Notably, during the Q3'2023 earnings call, management highlighted the improved momentum in the international market as cross-border nights booked grew 17% compared to the previous year. In a letter to shareholders, the company added, \"As international travel continues to recover, we're building greater momentum for Airbnb in under-penetrated markets. In Asia Pacific, our business has fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with gross nights growing 23% in Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2019. China outbound travel increased over 100% in Q3 2023 compared to a year ago. Smaller Asia Pacific markets such as Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Indonesia all experienced year-over-year growth above 30% for gross nights booked on an origin basis.\"\n\nAirbnb is up 17.3% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Airbnb's shares at the IPO in December 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,090.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "What Booking Holdings has that rivals want to emulate: Analyst",
        "content": "Recent earnings from travel & hospitality companies point to a slowdown in consumer demand. As consumers become more cautious with spending, some on Wall Street are wondering where to best position their portfolio to capitalize on these trends.\n\nRonald Josey, Citi Research Internet Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss travel stocks and where investors should keep an eye out for opportunities.\n\nJosey mentions Booking Holdings (BKNG) as one of this top picks, citing: \"It is a matter of scale. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. The more hotels you have, in what is an increasingly supply-driven market, the more you can generate greater demand. Booking having as many hotels as they do in Europe, increasingly in North America, also also in Asia-Pac, and, we think they're among the best positioned to benefit from this continued trend of travel... The thing that Booking has not just the scale in hotels to your question, it's also the know how and marketing efficiency on how to really go after those consumers that are willing and able to and want to spend on travel, and that's a super power that I think Booking has that everybody wants to emulate.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, a slew of travel earnings this week from Airbnb, Expedia, and Marriott all pointing to a slowdown or moderation in consumer demand, but our next guest says there's still opportunity for investors in the sector. For where to play in the travel space, let's bring in Ron Josey, City Research Internet Analyst.\n\nGreat to have you on today. Give me your sort of snapshot based on what we've heard from the companies before. Tough to make the comparison to the revenge travel that we saw last year but maybe not as bad as some people expected.\n\nRONALD JOSEY: Yeah. No, Akiko, I think you're right. It's a challenging time now, because we're coming off of 4Q where from what we heard, October was a challenge given the conflict in the Middle East, but then you heard Airbnb talk about accelerating growth in November and December.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou heard Expedia say that, you know, Vrbo continues to be somewhat challenged as they migrate to the new platform yet by and large, it seems as if consumer travel trends remain healthy. Unemployment is better or is where it is, and, you know, the big question we get constantly is we heard about the summer travel in '22, would that repeat in '23?\n\nThe answer was yes. The question is, does that repeat in '24? And frankly, I don't see any signs that would suggest otherwise and so it seems to me that the market is healthy. We do have some challenging comps overall. Everyone has already taken the trip, but when you have unemployment where it is and when you have, sort of, consumer confidence as high as it is, I actually think travel will be just fine this year.\n\nAnd 4Q was a little messy because of the October-- the conflict in the Middle East and 1Q gets a little bit messy, because Easter is early on in the year, but by and large, it seems like travel trends are holding up relatively well.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, so let's talk about some strategy here. I mean, Booking Holdings, your top pick, still waiting for those results to come through. But is it about scale when you think about where to put your money in what is expected to be continued momentum in the travel space?\n\nBooking is one of those that's got sort of a presence across the stack.\n\nRONALD JOSEY: Yeah, I know. I mean, within the online travel sub vertical, if you will, Booking is our top pick followed by Airbnb. Bigger picture, we love meta. We love Amazon. We love Uber as well, so we can talk about those. But no, it is a matter of scale. There's no if, ands, or buts about it.\n\nAnd the more hotels you have in what is increasingly a supply driven market, the more you can generate greater demand. And so Booking, you know, having as many hotels as they do in Europe, increasingly in North America and also in Asia Pac, we just think they are amongst the best positioned to benefit from this continued trend of travel.\n\nAnd again, might be a little messy here with where Easter lies in 1Q and given the issues in 4Q, but I think come summertime, I still think Booking is amongst the best position. And the thing that Booking has not just the scale and hotels, to your question, it's also the know how and marketing efficiency on how to really go after those consumers that are willing and able to and want to spend on travel.\n\nAnd that's a superpower that I think Booking has that everybody wants to emulate and what's different with Airbnb is, you know, they talk about 90% of traffic comes direct to their site, and so they don't need to advertise as much for performance, i.e. Getting that last booker, rather they're building up their brand, and they do a very good job of that.\n\nAnd the last thing I would just say on Airbnb is one of the key takeaways that we heard about from Airbnb this last quarter was they added or they now have 7.7 million listings on their site growing 18%. As that supply grows and you see travel becoming more intraregion, if you will, I think that's a positive for Airbnb as we go through this.",

        "title": "Want $1 Million in Retirement? Invest $250,000 in These 3 Stocks and Wait a Decade.",
        "content": "Many an investor has set a retirement goal of $1 million, and that's not necessarily impossible to reach -- or even surpass -- if you're consistently building your portfolio through the years.\n\nWhether you have a lot of capital to put to work, which could shorten the period in which it takes you to reach that $1 million goal, or you have a more modest amount of capital, which means you'll want to start investing earlier, consistently adding cash to high-quality businesses poised for long-term growth can help you achieve the returns you desire.\n\nWere you fortunate enough to have $250,000 to invest long term -- after paying off high-interest debts and establishing an emergency fund -- here are three fantastic stocks that could help you turn that amount into $1 million over the next decade and beyond.\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) is trading up by roughly 124% over the last five years. The biotech giant continues to build on an incredible wave of growth brought about by its highly successful cystic fibrosis drug franchise. The company brought in profits of $3.6 billion on revenue of $9.8 billion in the full year 2023.\n\nHowever, the company may be looking at just the beginning of its growth potential. It's developing multiple promising candidates across a variety of disease areas, many of which address rare conditions for which there are minimal effective treatment options.\n\nManagement plans to launch five new products by 2028. It's already in the early stages of accomplishing two of those five product launches with the recent approval of Casgevy, its CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy that is designed to be a one-time functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.\n\nVertex is taking on 60% of the costs associated with Casgevy while its development partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, will cover 40% of this cost. On the flip side, Vertex will share in 60% of the profits from Casgevy, with the cost of a single treatment expected to run at $2.2 million each.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement expects that its next two product launches are likely to be its new triple-combination cystic fibrosis therapy, and a drug that could potentially disrupt the standard of care for various pain ailments including acute and neuropathic pain across surgical as well as non-surgical settings.\n\nThis latter candidate, called VX-548, is not an opioid, so it wouldn't have the addictive qualities of many current pain treatment options that aren't over-the-counter drugs. Vertex estimates that the currently addressable market for VX-548 numbers around 90 million patients.\n\nThe future looks bright for this healthcare stock as it continues to derive growth from its existing portfolio of drugs and looks to future potential blockbusters that may be just on the horizon.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) is trading up over 50% from a year ago as the growth stock has regained favor with some investors after a volatile period. While many streaming stocks have dealt with growth decelerations following the pandemic peak when many consumers had little to do but view content for hours on head, Netflix is regaining its footing in a major way.\n\nBear in mind, Netflix is still the leading streaming provider in the U.S. with a robust market share of around 44%. There are certainly plenty of competitors, but with the global streaming market set to hit a valuation of $109 billion this year, there's room for multiple players.\n\nThe company generated net cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion in the final three months of 2023 alone. Full-year 2023 revenue came in at $34 billion, with net income totaling $5.4 billion, representing respective increases of 7% and 20% from 2022.\n\nNetflix ended the year with about 260 million paid streaming memberships globally. That was a 13% increase from a year ago, and an even more notable 56% increase from four years ago, right before the pandemic began. The company is having tremendous success in growing its subscriber base, partly due to a series of initiatives in the last 12 to 18 months.\n\nStarting last spring, it initiated a full-throttle crackdown on password sharing. This was a few months after launching its ad-supported tier, a more cost-effective option that runs at just $6.99 a month and allows access on two devices along with a wide range of content viewing options. Subscribers seem more than willing to pay for that viewing option and sit through some ads in the process for a monthly fee that runs about the same price as a couple of cups of coffee.\n\nIn fact, ad-supported-tier subscribers jumped 70% in the final quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter. Incidentally, that ad-supported tier alone now boasts 23 million active monthly users at last count, compared to the 15 million reported just in November.\n\nThere's so much room left for this company to run. Its continued profitability and the expansion of its subscriber base -- along with a broad addressable market that management estimates is around $600 billion -- can drive its share price steadily upward.\n\n3. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) entered the public markets in December 2020, a volatile stretch during the height of the pandemic. However, its shares have had quite a run recently as a resurgence in travel, coupled with the platform's resilience, have rekindled investor interest in the stock. The shares are trading up by around 30% over the trailing 12 months alone.\n\nThe company's effectiveness in facilitating both sides of a travel accommodation arrangement has led to considerable growth. Plus, the potential ahead is enormous. Management estimates Airbnb's total addressable market at $3.4 trillion. Of that total, short-term stays comprise $1.8 trillion, long-term stays $210 billion, and experiences $1.4 trillion. Experiences include activities like tours and classes that guests can book in their chosen stay location.\n\nPeople use Airbnb for all sorts of reasons, from vacations to business trips to long-term living arrangements, and this diversity is helping to drive the business forward even in a difficult macro environment. In fact, the cohort of guests living on Airbnb continues to account for a substantial portion of overall bookings.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, long-term stays of 28 days or longer comprised 18% of gross nights booked, while approximately 25% of long-term stays were for reservations of three months or more. Nights reserved for more than three months on Airbnb rose 20% in the third quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis.\n\nIn total, nights and experiences booked on Airbnb jumped 14% in the quarter compared to the prior-year period, while revenue rose 18% year over year to $3.4 billion. Profits for the quarter totaled $4.4 billion, a 267% increase from one year ago. Over the trailing 12 months, the travel stock has raked in free cash flow to the tune of $4.2 billion.\n\nWith a vast and still untapped addressable market, and a platform that management is constantly refining to meet the needs of hosts and guests, this business is well-positioned to launch itself to future growth over the next five to 10 years and beyond.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Are Absolutely Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "Many stocks received considerable ire from investors the last few years following pandemic highs, and in some cases, that volatility has been justified. However, it's also important to look beyond share price movements and evaluate the underlying businesses as a whole to determine whether a long-term investment thesis holds true.\n\nPlenty of growth stocks are demonstrating strength from robust businesses that can drive durable returns for investors over the long run. Here are two such names to consider as you add to your basket of stocks this month.\n\n1. Airbnb\n\nShares of Airbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB) have had a solid run up of more than 25% over the last year as a series of strong financial reports, bolstered by the ongoing travel resurgence, propelled the business forward. In fact, cross-border nights booked on Airbnb jumped 17% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the prior-year period.\n\nThe quarter marked a significant increase in bookings in cities, with the cohort of guests booking high-density urban nights on Airbnb soaring 15% from one year ago. Active listings were also up 19% year over year, with the company adding about 1 million new active listings to its platform in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nShort-term stays like business or leisure travel aren't the only trends driving this business forward. The growth of flexible and remote work sent an entirely new type of traveler to Airbnb's platform over the last few years, and the numbers bear that out.\n\nLong-term stays, which are bookings of 28 days or more, comprise about one-fifth of all nights booked on Airbnb. Approximately 25% of long-term stays were booked for trips of three months or more in the third quarter of 2023. On the whole, in the third quarter of 2023, travelers booked 20% more trips lasting over three months on Airbnb than they did in the same period the prior year.\n\nAirbnb continues to rake in cash and profits at an astonishing pace, and it's doing so with a business that remains largely asset-light because it doesn't own or operate stays on its platform. This looks like a business to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if the economy takes a dip in the coming months, consumers will still spend money on travel over the long run. That's a durable trend Airbnb can benefit from, even as it continues to derive growth from a wide variety of sources of travel spending.\n\n2. Duolingo\n\nDuolingo(NASDAQ: DUOL) is one of the most-used language learning apps on the market. This is no small feat, considering that language learning represents a global market opportunity that some estimates show could hit a valuation of about $337 billion by 2032.\n\nDuolingo makes money in two primary ways: a free tier option that generates revenue from advertising, and paid subscriptions. In the third quarter of 2023, Duolingo reported that its business had 24.2 million daily active users. That figure was a 63% jump from a year ago.\n\nIts monthly active user count was 83.1 million globally, up 47% from a year ago. However, paid subscriber penetration of that monthly active user base was just 8% at most recent count.\n\nIn short, even as the company has a growing base of language learners and faces a broad, expanding addressable market, its cohort of paid subscribers is just a fraction of its overall user count. This gives Duolingo tremendous room to grow not only from new language learners but also existing users that are already on the platform in the years ahead.\n\nOn that note, paid subscribers are growing at a substantial rate. Duolingo's paid subscriber base of 5.8 million users at the end of the third quarter of 2023 was a 60% increase from the end of the third quarter of 2022.\n\nDuolingo is growing revenue at a solid rate, and is profitable. Its top line for the third quarter of 2023 totaled $138 million, a 43% hike from one year ago. The company also pulled in net income of $2.8 million for the three-month period, compared to a net loss of $18 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors seem to be interested in the stock, having given shares a run-up of about 100% in the trailing 12 months alone. Given the prospects and growth of this business, it might be a good time to snag a slice of the action.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Top three short-term rental markets expected in 2024: Report",
        "content": "The short-term rental market has come into focus following Airbnb's (ABNB) latest earnings results highlighting growth opportunities beyond homeowners just listing properties. According to data from AirDNA, the top markets for short-term rentals in 2024 are: Columbus, Georgia; Ellsworth, Maine; and Logan, Ohio.\n\nYahoo Finance Housing Reporter Dani Romero breaks down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: While Airbnb's recent earnings reports indicates a moderation in demand, the opportunity to jump into the short-term rental market hasn't necessarily run its course.\n\nTo take a look at the top best places to invest in short-term rentals, let's bring in our very own Dani Romero, who has a breakdown. Dani, we should point out Airbnb likes to say that it isn't always about users on their platform who are just trying to cash in on homes that they buy just to rent out, but there is still a lot of opportunity for additional income here.\n\nDANI ROMERO: Yeah. Most of these investors that are on the Airbnb platform are also investors that have multiple listings. They're looking for other forms of income, whether that's for their retirement.\n\nBut back to this study from AirDNA, this is the year of the short-term rentals. And what's really interesting from this AirDNA report is that it doesn't list the popular pandemic boomtowns like Austin, Texas, Boise, Idaho, or even Phoenix, Arizona, which is a really telling sign that there's opportunity elsewhere.\n\nWell, let's take a look at the top three areas. At number one, we have Columbus, Georgia. A town known for the longest whitewater course. AirDNA estimates a robust demand. The average daily rate is $178. And investors could gain about $29,000 in revenue.\n\nNow, the city does require permits for short-term rentals and certificate of occupancy. Second on the list is Ellsworth, Maine. The biggest advantage here is how close it is to Acadia National Park.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's a park that has scenic hikes and views-- views, excuse me. AirDNA estimates the average daily rate for this area to be $335. And investors could gain $41,000 in revenue.\n\nLastly is Logan, Ohio. And the case there is to be made is that visitors can come and visit the area for the rugged valleys that it offers AirDNA estimates that the average daily rate is $343. And investors could earn up to $57,000 in revenue.\n\nBut it's important to note that Logan has strict zoning regulations and requires registration and licensing fees. Bottom line, as an investor and a visitor, do your research before going out to that area. Akiko?\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: $57,000 in revenue. It's not bad. Not a bad return there. Dani Romero, thanks so much for breaking that down.",

The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 billion.\r\n\r\nThe year-over-year increase was driven by a continuous improvement in Nights and Experiences Booked.\r\n\r\nGrowing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum across high-density urban areas, remained a positive. Increasing guest demand, especially among first-time bookers, was a plus. Continuous recovery in cross-border travel aided the quarterly performance.\r\n\r\nThese factors aided growth in the company\u2019s Gross Booking Value (GBV) in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, a solid momentum in Airbnb app downloads contributed well.\n\nAirbnb, Inc.

        "title": "Here's Why Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Airbnb, Inc. Currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ABNB that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor ABNB, shares are up 0.71% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Content industry is up 1.7% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.7% compares favorably with the industry's 0.28% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Airbnb, Inc. Have risen 18.92%, and are up 24.78% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 12.75% and 21.39%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of ABNB's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, ABNB is averaging 5,039,470 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ABNB.\n\nOver the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ABNB's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.36 to $4.43 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ABNB is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Airbnb, Inc. On your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company also signaling a potential moderation in demand. Joining us now, we've got Jed Kelly, Oppenheimer managing director of equity research for the consumer market or consumer internet, here. Great to have you here with us right now. I want to get your read-in on this report and the tenor that you took away from the call last night.\n\nJED KELLY: Yeah, I mean, the report was mixed, obviously. The market doesn't like that we had another quarter of decelerating room nights and they're guiding for another-- they're guiding for one Q to decelerate, right? So, the issue you have is the stock still trades at a premium multiple, you know, low 20s EV/EBITDA, and you have room nights, you know, you have one Q room nights in the high single-- now in the high single digits.\n\nStory continues\n\nProbably around where the Street is shaking out is around 9% growth for the first quarter. Now room nights should reaccelerate slightly because the comps do ease. However, it's still not what you're looking for for people to get excited given where the stock is trading right now.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And we know that they did highlight things like their Q4 supply growth growing 18% year over year. How much of that can they really hang their hat on? I know they also talked about expanding internationally beyond their core market here.\n\nJED KELLY: Yeah, no, the supply growth is great. I mean, they're growing over 18%. I think a lot of fear was in '22, that everyone thought they were able to accelerate supply from the COVID uplift. So supply is great. But the question, I think, a lot of investors are having is typically demand and supply usually converge, and supply is a good read through for future demand, but it's not happening right now.\n\nSo it kind of makes you question, what's the incremental sell-through rate of the inventory? Are they adding more quality rooms, right? And I think some of the fear among investors is as they're getting into more urban areas, or travelers are returning to more urban areas, that inventory is not converting.\n\nAnd then to your other point on international expansion, they are expanding into more areas. However, that inventory doesn't look to be converting as well either. That could just be travelers in those areas still aren't comfortable on the Airbnb platform, and there needs to be some consumer education.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And so, in bookings with more urban area kind of listings and hosts, how does that trickle through to the average daily rate, which we've seen kind of stall out here?\n\nJED KELLY: Yeah, the mix shift to urban typically carries a lower ADR than your, you know, three-bedroom vacation home in the Outer Banks. So, the mix shift to more international markets and more urban generally would cause ADRs to go down. However, on a like-for-like basis, ADRs are still hanging in there. I mean, Airbnb is introducing more tools for hosts to drive value, increase conversion. However, ADRs are remaining pretty sticky right now.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Jed, I want to also put this in context of the one-time tax charge that was also included in these numbers. When you look at that in terms of the overall fundamentals then, when you're looking at the numbers then, how should we really gauge the health of this business?\n\nJED KELLY: Well, the business is very healthy. I mean, this was a one-time tax charge that they're going to have to pay, but when you look at their overall free cash flow, they're still going to generate well over $4 billion of free cash flow this year. I mean, from a free cash flow position, the business is really healthy.\n\nAnd actually, on valuation perspective or valuation basis, it trades at a favorable free cash flow yield, relative to EV/EBITDA because they have positive capital dynamics. So this was a one-time tax charge. Doesn't indicate the health of the business.\n\nThe business is healthy. I think the question for investors right now is we have decelerating room nights, but a premium valuation. So, you know, what's the right entry point to get in given some of the top-line KPIs?",

        "content": "Airbnb downgraded, Citi upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nPiper Sandler upgraded Citi (C) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $63, up from $56. The firm believes Citigroup's unique story remains intact. Morgan Stanley upgraded Cadence Design(CDNS) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $350, up from $260. Weak Q1 guidance is offset by strength signaled into the rest of FY24, says the firm, which expects momentum in chip design will continue into next year at least and expects investors to focus on momentum into 2024-2025. BofA upgraded SentinelOne (S) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $35, up from $26.50. Though competition remains intense, the firm cites the near-term path to profitability and free cash flow, reaccelerating net new annual recurring revenue growth and improving market conditions for its more positive view. HSBC upgraded HP Inc.(HPQ) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $33, up from $30. The firm says global PC shipments are recovering, while the PC refresh cycle, end of life of Windows 10, and adoption of artificial intelligence PCs offer tailwinds for HP. JPMorgan upgraded Bruker (BRKR) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $90, up from $60, after the company reported a \"sizeable\" Q4 beat and gave \"strong,\" better-than-expected 2024 guidance.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nDA Davidson downgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $145. While Airbnb's Q4 results were \"solid,\" with \"decent\" upside versus expectations on both the topline and adjusted EBITDA, management's outlook commentary for Q1 and calendar 2024 suggests that this year may reflect a more normalized room night growth environment, the firm tells investors. Loop Capital downgraded Ulta Beauty(ULTA) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged $530 price target. The rating change reflects the current valuation levels as opposed to a more bearish view of the company's fundamentals as the stock has gained 25% since June 2023 vs. the 14% rise in the S&P 500, the firm says. HSBC downgraded Twilio (TWLO) to Reduce from Hold with a price target of $61, down from $62. Twilio is trading at a large premium to similar \"low-growth\" companies in the sector on non-GAAP valuation metrics, the firm says. JPMorgan downgraded QuidelOrtho (QDEL) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $37, down from $66. The company reported a \"substantial\" Q4 margin and earnings miss, while initiating disappointing 2024 guidance that calls for adjusted earnings 46% below the Street at the midpoint, the firm tells investors in a research note. Craig-Hallum and William Blair also downgraded QuidelOrtho to Neutral-equivalent ratings. JPMorgan downgraded Ecolab (ECL) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $220, up from $200. The shares are 49% higher over the past year and the company's consolidated volume performance in 2023 was roughly flat and is likely to be roughly flat to higher in 2024, the firm notes.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBernstein initiated coverage of Wingstop (WING) with an Outperform rating and $340 price target. The firm believes Wingstop is a \"category of one\" concept in the fastest growing segment of the restaurant industry with a potential to be \"the next Domino's.\" Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Steven Madden(SHOO) with a Neutral rating and $45 price target. Steven Madden is a \"strong operator with a trusted management team,\" but the stock's valuation and potential cost headwinds warrant a Neutral view, the firm says. Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of TKO Group (TKO) with an Equal Weight rating and $95 price target. The firm sees limited upside to consensus estimates and views the stock's valuation as fair relative to TKO's growth and history. RBC Capital initiated coverage of SolarEdge (SEDG) with a Sector Perform rating and $85 price target. Though the firm believes that current valuation multiples have troughed and 2024-2025 expectations are largely derisked, it awaits proof points of a margin recovery. RBC Capital initiated coverage of First Solar(FSLR) with an Outperform rating and $195 price target. As the global leader in thin film CdTe technology and the largest supplier and domestic manufacturer of solar modules in the U.S., the company has a demonstrated history of being able to grow production, reduce costs, and improve performance, says the firm, which believes the strong visibility for earnings growth and free cash flow generation are \"underappreciated.\" RBC also started coverage of Enphase Energy (ENPH) with an Outperform rating and $140 price target.",

        "content": "Airbnb (ABNB) shares move lower in Wednesday's pre-market trading after indicating moderation in demand in its mixed fourth-quarter earnings results. Yahoo Finance Live discusses the lodging service's most important figures, including bookings and active listings for the quarter.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Airbnb shares slipping in pre-market trading after reporting mixed fourth quarter results, and suggesting there could be some moderation in the number of nights and experiences booked.\n\nLet's get to our top takeaways from the report here. As we're taking a look at shares pre-market, they are down by about 3.7%. I think, for me, one of the huge things that jumped out was, ultimately, on the side of the ADR, this average daily rate-- one of the things that Akiko, who is going to be covering this as well during the 11 AM hour, I believe-- one of the huge things that jumped out to both of us, as we were slacking yesterday was just about where this continues to moderate.\n\nAnd so if this stalls, is that more indication of us to the amount of supply that's entered into this market for Airbnb listings in more urban, more city centers that had actually brought down a lot of that average daily rate? Or does this mean that now you have more of the non-urban, or suburban, or even of countryside, and rent and stay here, and you get your golf cart or something like that type of places that bring up that average? And are we going to see more of those continue to list as well?\n\nSo that's one thing that it's really going to be interesting to track from this point forward. But that was one area that investors were keeping tabs on, and some of the slippage that we had seen late last year as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true because they did talk about that need of having the right product in the right place at the right time for big events and things like that. And, obviously, there was a lot of backlash, when people complained about the fees, especially, the cleaning fees. Talked about walking back a lot of that and seeing a lot more inventory coming to the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so with that in mind, the thing I'm focusing on is Q4 supply growth growing 18% year-over-year. We saw in the earnings call, they called that a real highlight adding nearly 1.2 million active listings over the last year.\n\nAnd it was that thing, again, about timing. They saw the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. And they also talked about the majority of these new listings being exclusive to Airbnb. And I know there's been a lot of pushback about people having perhaps second houses using them as Airbnbs, what that's doing for house prices, and really constraining the supply of, perhaps, first time home buyers.\n\nBut, at least, for now, Airbnb is seeming to have that network effect. And it's really feeding into itself.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Indeed. We're going to continue to track shares of ABNB, as we get closer to the start of today's trading activity.",

Futures edging higher. Rebounding slightly from Tuesday's sell off following a hotter than expected inflation report, which showed January prices rising more than forecast anticipated.\n\nThe Dow closing down more than 500 points. The index's worst day since March of 2023. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ each ending the session off more than 1%. The sticky inflation report indicating the Federal Reserve may start cutting interest rates later than expected this year, and further fueling that debate on when those cuts will come.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: We're also watching shares of Lyft this morning. A typo in the rideshare company's fourth quarter earnings release sending Lyft up more than 60% in extended trading. Initially, Lyft forecasted a 500-basis point expansion of its adjusted earnings margin for the full year. The company later clarifying the numbers should have read 50 basis points reversing the stock's course. Shares now up around 21%.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: And Airbnb shares, they are slipping in pre-market trading. The online rental marketplace reporting an adjusted loss per share of $0.55. That's narrower than Street expectations of $0.68 a share. The company also beat Street's revenue expectations, while suggesting there could be more moderation in demand going forward.\n\nOn Airbnb earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said, he remains optimistic about the company's growth and expansion into international markets.",

        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 13, 2024\n\nAirbnb, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.76, expectations were $0.67. Airbnb, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAngela Yang: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's fourth quarter of 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.\n\nThese factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that, I will pass the call to Brian.\n\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am excited to share our results with you. We wrapped 2023 with another strong quarter. We had 99 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q4, marking our highest fourth quarter ever. Revenue of $2.2 billion grew 70% year-over-year. Net loss was $249 million. But when excluding nonrecurring tax items, adjusted net income was $489 million, representing an adjusted net income margin of 22%. For the full year, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion, our highest ever. Because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased $2.25 billion of our shares during 2023. And I'm excited to announce that today, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur strong results in 2023 were driven by our focus on 3 strategic priorities, making hosting mainstream, perfecting our first service and expanding beyond the core. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We've been focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling in Airbnb. Our results show that our approach is working. In Q4, our host community grew to 5 million hosts around the globe. Active listings exceeded $7.7 million by the end of 2023, increasing 18% year-over-year. And we also saw sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions. All in all, in 2023, host earned more than $57 billion. This year, we are going to continue to raise awareness from hosting and improve the overall host experience. Second, we're perfecting our core service.\n\nOver the past 3 years, we've launched more than 430 new features and upgrades to our core service. We've made significant improvements to make Airbnb a more affordable and reliable option, and we are already seeing a positive impact. For example, post cancellations have decreased by 36% in Q4 of 2023, and this is compared to the same period a year ago. And now two thirds of our host offer a weekly or monthly discount. We will never stop perfecting our core service. In the year ahead, we'll remain focused on improving the quality and reliability of stays. Finally, we are expanding beyond the core. Airbnb is at an inflection point. We spent the last 3 years perfecting our core service, and we are now ready to embark on our next chapter. We're focused on unlocking more growth opportunities by investing in underpenetrated international markets, and we're seeing some great results. A vacation home luxury bedroom setup with stunning decor showing a desired getaway experience.\n\nFollowing the success that we've seen in recent quarters in Germany, Brazil and Korea, we're now rolling out our playbook in other countries, including Switzerland, Belgium and Netherlands. But this is only one piece of a much bigger strategy because we've always believed that Airbnb was destined to offer more than just a place to stay. And now is the time for us to expand beyond our core business and reinvent Airbnb. And there are a few reasons why. I mean, first, we want people to love our core service before offering them something new. And with hundreds of improvements we made over the past 3 years, the Airbnb service is now better than it's ever been. Second, we've been able to attract some of the best talent in the world, and we now have the capabilities to do so much more.\n\nAnd third, there is a new platform shift with AI, and it will allow us to do things we never could have imagined. While we've been using AI across our service for years, we believe we can become a leader in developing some of the most innovative and personalized AI interfaces in the world. In November, we accelerated our efforts with the acquisition of GamePlanner.AI, a stealth AI company led by the Co-Founder and original developer of Siri. With these critical pieces in place, we're now ready to expand beyond our core business. Now this will be a multiyear journey, and we will share more with you towards the end of this year. Now looking back on Q4, we also saw a number of very positive business highlights. First, we surpassed 5 million hosts in the platform and saw meaningful supply growth across all regions.\n\nWe added nearly 1.2 million listings in 2023, ending the year with over 7.7 million active listings. Q4 supply growth grew 18% year-over-year. Now this is a real highlight. And we saw the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. So obviously, there's a real strong network effect happening here. We also continue to see relatively similar supply growth among individual and professional hosts with the majority of these listings exclusive to Airbnb. Now second, we continue to see strong demand on Airbnb. Now this is especially true amongst first-time bookers, which is particularly encouraging. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 12% compared to a year ago and following some volatile in October, Nights Booked actually accelerated throughout the remainder of the quarter, and Q4 also marked the highest quarterly growth rate of the year for first-time bookers.\n\nAnd additionally, we also gained momentum in app downloads and app bookings. 55% of gross Nights Booked were on our app. This is up from 50% a year ago. And finally, we're driving affordability for guests. Throughout 2023, we introduced several features to make Airbnb every more affordable from new pricing tools for hosts to increased pricing transparency for guests. Since launching these features, we've seen 1.4 million hosts use similar listings, which lets host compare to price or listing to others in the area. Nearly 300,000 listings have removed or lowered their cleaning fee. And by year-end, nearly 40% of our active listings didn't charge a cleaning fee at all. So our work around affordability is paying off. In December, the average nightly price of a 1-bedroom listing on Airbnb was $114 [ph] a night.\n\nThis is down 2% from the same period last year, while hotel prices rose 7% to $149 over the same period. Now before I turn to Q&A, I want to share the latest on two executive updates we announced at the end of last year. To start, Dave Stephenson is now Airbnb's first Chief Business Officer. Over the past 5 years, Dave has done an incredible job as CFO, and our business is stronger than ever. One of the qualities that is so remarkable about Dave is that he's not just a world-class finance leader. He's also a world class operator. And whenever I need someone to quickly drive a complicated series of operations together to clear outcome that doesn't compromise our values, I turn to Dave. As we expand beyond our core, it will be paramount to have an executive dedicated to our long-term growth plans, and there is nobody better than Dave to do this.\n\nDave will continue to drive growth across existing and new businesses, and this includes driving international expansion, growing global host supply and leading all business and corporate development activities at Airbnb. Now as Dave takes on this position, I am thrilled that Ellie Mertz will be our CFO. You see Ellie has been my right hand for 11 years, and many of you already know here and are well aware of impressive track record at Airbnb. She led our IPO during one of the most pivotal moments in our company's history. And for the past several years, Ellie has overseen Strategic Finance and Analysis, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. And under her leadership, our company grew from adolescent to adulthood with revenue growing over 100x.\n\nI am thrilled that she's stepping into this role. Dave has already started as Chief Business Officer; and Ellie will officially transition to CFO on March 1. So next call, you will hear from Ellie. Before we go to questions, I'd just love to hand over to David to share a few thoughts. Dave?\n\nDavid Stephenson: Thanks, Brian. I'm really excited about my new role as Chief Business Officer. In this role, I'm focused on driving Airbnb's growth by concentrating in three specific areas. First, continuing to grow our high-quality supply of stays and experiences around the world; second, leading our global expansion efforts in underpenetrated countries; and third, developing and launching new businesses as we expand beyond the core. As Brian has said, this is a transformational year for Airbnb. I look forward to Ellie becoming our CFO next month. I couldn't think of a better person to lead us into the next phase of growth. And so with that, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nSee also Top 20 Most Respected Countries in Europe and 20 Cheapest Places to Retire with Good Healthcare.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

Thanks for joining. I am excited to share our results with you. \r\nWe wrapped 2023 with another strong quarter. We had 99 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q4, marking our highest fourth quarter ever. Revenue of $2.2 billion grew 70% year-over-year. Net loss was $249 million. But when excluding nonrecurring tax items, adjusted net income was $489 million, representing an adjusted net income margin of 22%. \r\nFor the full year, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion, our highest ever.

And I'm excited to announce that, today, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion of our Class A common stock. \r\nOur strong results in 2023 were driven by our focus on 3 strategic priorities: making hosting mainstream, perfecting our core service and expanding beyond the core.

I look forward to Ellie becoming our CFO next month. I couldn't think of a better person to lead us into the next phase of growth. And so with that, let's open up the call for Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nDave, congrats on the role, and Ellie, to you as well. Brian, I wanted to ask a little bit more on just expanding beyond the core. I think you said now is the time to do it and to stay tuned towards the end of the year. But then you also talked about being a leader in personalized AI. \r\nCan you just give us a little more insight on how you're thinking about AI, given the acquisition of GamePlanner? And then as we think about these newer underpenetrated markets, Switzerland, Belgium and Netherlands, talk to us about just lessons learned from, call it, Germany, Korea, Brazil that you can apply to these newer markets?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes, absolutely, Ron. Thanks for asking the question. So yes, let me start with AI. So I think, to talk about AI, it would be good to zoom out, just lay out the landscape. One way to think about AI is, let's use a real-world metaphor. I mentioned we're building a city. And in that city, we have infrastructure, like roads and bridges. And then on top of those roads and bridges, we have applications like cars. \r\nSo Airbnb is not an infrastructure company. Infrastructure would be a large language model or, obviously, GPUs. So we're not going to be investing in infrastructure. So we're not going to be building a large language model. We'll be relying on, obviously, OpenAI. Google makes -- or create a model, Meta creates models. So those are really infrastructure. They're really developing infrastructure. \r\nBut where we can excel is on the application layer. And I believe that we can build one of the leading and most innovative AI interfaces ever created. And maybe one way to make this real is if you were to open, say, ChatGPT or Google, though the models are very powerful, the interface is really not an AI interface. It's the same interface as the 2000s, in a sense, the 2010s. It's a typical classical web interface. So we feel like the models, in a sense, are probably underutilized. \r\nHere's another way of saying it. Take your phone and look at all the icons on your phone. Most of those apps have not fundamentally changed since the advent of Generative AI. So what I think AI represents is the ultimate platform shift. We had the internet. We had mobile. Airbnb really rose during the rise of mobile. \r\nAnd the thing about a platform shift, as you know, there is also a shift in power. There's a shift of behavior. And so I think this is a 0-0 ball game, where Airbnb, we have a platform that was built for 1 vertical short-term space. And I think with AI -- Generative AI and developing a leading AI interface to provide an experience that's so much more personalized than anything you've ever seen before. \r\nImagine an app that you feel like it knows you, it's like the ultimate Concierge, an interface that is adaptive and evolving and changing in real-time, unlike no interface you've ever seen before. That would allow us to go from a single vertical company to a cross-vertical company. Because one of the things that we've noticed is the largest tech companies aren't a single vertical. \r\nAnd we studied Amazon in the late '90s, early 2000s, when they went from books to everything, or Apple when they launched the App Store. And these really large technology companies are horizontal platforms. And I think with AI and the work we're doing around AI interfaces, I think that's what you should expect of us. \r\nWe're not going to talk specifically on this call about the specific products and services we're going to be offering, but you will see some very big announcements later this year. And as you know, we did an acquisition of GamePlanner AI. It was from the creator of Siri. And that was just accelerating the efforts we are already endeavoring on.\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nAnd then in terms -- I was going to answer the second question was...\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nSorry, I think...\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes, your underpenetrated markets. We've learned a few things. First, we just need to make sure that we have great supply, and great supply in specific nights. So even the subtleties of local holidays and ensuring that we're there, that we have it at all price points. \r\nDifferent countries have different expectations on what the supply growth looks like. And then just being, two, we have the right product, things like we've done include installment payments in Brazil and Latin America, [neighbor] log-in in Korea, just making sure that we're showing up locally in the ways that they're expecting. \r\nAnd then the third is just to make sure we have a full-funnel marketing approach. In some of these countries, we're now big enough where we can have a small team do very targeted social marketing, PR, communications, use influencers, search engine marketing, but to build that on top of brand marketing, to have that all work together in 1 full-funnel approach. Lower than -- approximately 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid because the majority of Airbnb stays are unique to us, and that continues to drive the flywheel. But having this full-funnel approach is very effective when we implement it on the ground in these countries.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\n\nI was curious how the building blocks or sort of the way you're thinking about the macro environment and the idiosyncratic growth the company is sort of looking at for Q1, driven by elements of both supply and demand. And what do you see as sort of the exit dynamics from 2023?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nAgain, what we saw exiting 2023 was interesting, right? When we were on this call a quarter ago, we have seen some softness in demand in October. And then what we -- and so we guided to that kind of expectation. And then what we saw is accelerating demand in November and December. And then as we come into -- from that strength, 17% kind of revenue growth and 12% nights growth in the fourth quarter, we're seeing really stable demand coming at the start of the year. \r\nYou have to actually rewind the tapes and remind yourself that we were just exiting kind of Omicron, and there's a lot of pent-up demand in January of last year, which makes for some harder comps in Q1. But against those harder comps, we're continuing to see strong demand for travel. I think that we continue to see a very robust demand for people staying on Airbnbs versus just necessarily kind of buying other things. So the experiences over things continues to be a big trend. \r\nAnd we're excited to see the growth that we're continuing to see in our established businesses in North America and Europe and even greater growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. So as we do things, as I said on the last question, about doubling down and making sure that we invest in these expansion countries where we're underpenetrated. I think that's going to continue to drive growth for us for the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson from KeyBanc.\n\nJustin Tyler Patterson\n\nAll right. There's been a lot of investor interest around the cross-currency fee. How should we think about that phasing in over the course of the year and the potential financial impact from that? And then further, could you talk about just why you viewed now is the right time to pull that lever? So we view this as a sign that you'll take pricing actions, where there's the value of the disconnect more regularly than in the past?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. Just to be clear, when we announced just recently, we updated our terms of service. And what it did is it gives us the ability to implement a cross-currency view. So we needed to update the terms of service just to allow us to do it. Now the fee only applies when the currency of the guest uses to pay differs from the currency that the hosts set for their listing. \r\nSo we don't anticipate this fee to affect the majority of our guests because the cross-currency transactions are only approximately 20% of our gross booking value. It's different than our cross-border, which is closer to 40%. And we anticipate the majority of the fee changes to be closer to 1%. So we're going to test and evaluate and just see what the results are, and that testing will begin in April. \r\nWhy now? There's just a point where we understand that the size and complexity of our business ensures that we should be making sure we're providing great value to our guests and our hosts. We did things, like last year, we had a change to our long-term stay fees for beyond 3 months. That was an opportunity where we saw that maybe the fees were too high relative to the benefit we're giving. \r\nI think there's just a fundamental principle where we want to make sure that we're giving more value to our guests and our hosts than we take in our take rate over time. And we're going to continue to be more nuanced in how we make those choices going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\n\nI have 2, 1 big picture and 1 sort of accounting. So big picture one, you guys have made a lot of interesting changes to the U.S. around flexible and new tools for hosts, et cetera. Brian, can you just sort of talk to us about areas of progress you've made on improving conversion or getting hosts to lower prices in the U.S.? And sort of what are the existing hurdles you have to overcome to kind of get power hosts and hosts to kind of lower prices more in the U.S.? And then the second one on Dave or Ellie. If -- there's a lot of moving pieces around this 1Q guide. If we're sort of thinking through gross bookings versus revenue, and we're getting to room night growth and sort of the mid- to high single digits. Is that right? Or are there sort of other moving pieces that we're missing around the room night growth calculation?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. Why don't I start, Brian. So you could think of probably like 3 really big buckets of work that are going to drive conversion of Airbnb. One is our work on affordability. The next is really product optimization. And the third is really quality and reliability. So let me talk about all 3, and I'll start with affordability. \r\nA couple of years ago, we noticed that there was quite a lot of, call it, a feedback we're getting from our guests that Airbnb was getting more expensive. And so last year, we really hunkered down and rolled out a suite of tools for guests and hosts to make their being more affordable, starting with total price display, where you now can turn on a toggle and see the total price upfront, including taxes and cleaning fees and service fees. Now this tool is really important because now we are pushing more demand to listings at better prices. We've also seen some really positive knock-on effects. \r\nFor example, [300,000] listings have now reduced or eliminated their cleaning fee, and 40% of listing globally don't even have a cleaning fee. The next thing we did is, we encouraged more hosts then to provide discounts for weekly or monthly stays. As you know, 19% of our nights are monthly stays and more than 40% are weekly. Well, now, 2 out of 3 hosts have a monthly or a weekly discount. So this has been a huge, huge improvement. \r\nAnd we also launched a product called Compare Listings. One of the things we noticed is that hosts are more likely to have a competitive price if they see what other similar listings are charging in their neighborhood, and then they can see whether they're getting booked or not. Well, since we rolled out that tool, 1.4 million hosts have turned the tool on, and this means they'll provide more competitive listing. The result of which, Brian, is that our prices year-over-year for 1 bedroom apartment globally are down 2%, where hotels are up 7%. That's a 9% swing. \r\nThe next is product optimization. Here's a simple way to think about it. We did $9.9 billion of revenue last year, so let's round that to $10 billion for really simple numbers. All we have to do is increase our Nights Booked by 100 basis points. and that's $100 million of revenue. And if we can increase $100 million of revenue to be $100 million of very like high-margin revenue because we're converting presumably traffic we really have on the website. \r\nAnd so there's a number of things we're doing on product composition to increase conversion rate. One of the big things, as you noticed, it's not inflexible. Here's a simple way to think about it. We are never close to sold out in Airbnb. If we can just point demand where we have supply by getting people to be more flexible of their dates or a little more flexible about their radius or the location, that would be massive. We also made some optimization to get more people to download our app. And now we are very typically a top 50 application in the United States, and now 55% of our bookings are now in a native application. So those are some of things that are on product optimization. \r\nThe last thing I'll talk about is reliability. We launched Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites, the reason we launched this is, for every person who stays in a hotel, 9 people stay on Airbnb. Sorry, for every person that stays in Airbnb, 9 people stay in a hotel. What if we could get just 1 of those people who stays in a hotel to stay in Airbnb? We would quite literally double the size of our business. \r\nSo when you ask people who book hotels why they don't book Airbnbs, there's 2 reasons. One, well, it's habitual, they've always booked hotels. And the other is they are comforted by the reliability, the consistency of the hotel experience. And we asked what if we had a product that was as consistent as a hotel from a quality standpoint, but had all the unique advantages of the Airbnb. It was more affordable, it was more unique with more character, and it's better equipped. \r\nAnd that's exactly Guest Favorites are. They are 2 million of the best listings on Airbnb based on rating review and reliability data on 500 million trips in Airbnb. Since we launched that product in November, we are seeing a shift in bookings towards Guest Favorites. That's, of course, good because, number one, they get fewer customer service contacts, the customer service costs go down. They have higher 5-star rating trips, so we have better repeat bookings. And we think this will attract people to Airbnb that never considered us before. \r\nSo those are just some of the things we're doing. The last thing I'll say before I hand it over to Dave, is that, that's just we did last year. We had 200 -- about 200 upgrades last year, 430 in the last 3 years, but we are just getting started, and we're going to have significantly larger upgrades this year. Dave?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. In terms of the Q1 guide on room nights growth, again, I think you have to remember that we have a hard comp versus Q1 of '23, where there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of the holidays. And we saw much stronger growth early in the year, especially in January. I think the other thing that's unusual about Q1 this year is Easter moved from Q2 to Q1. \r\nSo this actually helps our revenue by 100 to 200 basis points in Q1, but actually is a drag on nights because we actually get fewer Nights Booked in the period as people are actually doing their traveling on holidays. So it will shift some nights from Q1 to Q2. So revenue is a little bit helped Q2 to Q1, and bookings and Nights Booked are slightly hurt Q1 to Q2, and then don't forget the hard comps. So this is why we have the language of moderating from 12% growth in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\n\nEllie, can you just help us understand the commentary on EBITDA a little bit better for '24? Are the incremental investments that could drag on the margins, is that primarily about expanding beyond the core and tied to some of the new initiatives that Brian talked about that we'll learn about later this year? Or is that more around marketing or just something around kind of the existing business?\n\nElinor B. Mertz\n\nThanks, Doug. I was actually going to start next quarter, but thanks for pointing it to me. So what you saw in the guidance language that we provided is that we are basically giving ourselves a floor in terms of the full year EBITDA margin guidance. As we said, we will hold or provide a minimum of 35%, which is slightly down from what we delivered in 2023. The intent here is really to ensure that we have flexibility over the course of the year to continue to invest in a variety of growth opportunities as they appear. So what might those be? \r\nSo first, we have a pretty robust budget in terms of our international expansion, but there's certainly opportunities at the margin to continue to invest in newer markets. Second, there's always opportunities in terms of looking at our high ROI marketing channels and adding marginally at the top. Third, what we note, given the ambitions around our product development road map, is that obviously often constrained by our resources there. \r\nAnd so we may look to add incremental product resources to increase the throughput of our overall product team. And then finally, obviously, we haven't said much with regard to what the platform extensions will look like in the back of the year, but we also want to give ourselves flexibility there to ensure that we're able to share something broadly and meaningful by the end of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\n\nI just want to ask about room nights. We all know there's a tough comp in Q1, but -- and that was partially due to the reopening, but we're kind of over COVID now. And just kind of thinking about where you are in the room night cycle going forward? And what are the key drivers for nights? Is it growing supply and just getting that conversion level better? The big picture, just saying, it looks like a tough comp in Q1, but how do you think about the rest of the year and where nights can grow over the medium term?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. Again, we are starting to see overall kind of demand normalize. I think you also look at our nights growth and the nights on Airbnb and to continue to see that we take share of overall accommodations globally versus kind of traditional accommodations and are either equaling or exceeding versus our key competition. So I think if you just look at room nights growth, we continue to see strength relative to traditional hospitality and our competition. \r\nAnd you're exactly right. The key focus is on supply. There's been a lot of critique around whether or not we have sufficient supply growth. I hope that we continue to show that strength with the 7.7 million active listings. They're growing 18% year-over-year. We saw incredible strength throughout the year, 5 million hosts, the vast majority of this listing is being unique to Airbnb. And I think that, that uniqueness also gives us a lot of strength on, I'd say, conversion and a lot of the things that Brian talked about in terms of perfecting price, making it easier to shop and find the right home for each guest is incredibly important. So perfecting the core service is there. \r\nAnd then the last piece, which we've also talked about, is just finding the areas where we are underpenetrated relative to where the opportunity is. And I think that's the vast majority of countries around the world. And when we make sure to apply a product view, a marketing view and a supply view in a targeted way in each country, we're unlocking incremental growth. And that's what we've seen wide Brazil has nearly doubled since 2019. So yes, it's supply, it's product, it's full marketing, and it's doubling down in underpenetrated countries.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen.\n\nKevin Campbell Kopelman\n\nI had a follow-up on the margin question. Could you give any more color on your kind of initial thinking for the year on growing headcount, and also how you're thinking about the marketing plan to support the growth initiatives that you talked about?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. In terms of headcount, we grew headcount last year about 1%. We're planning to grow at maybe slightly more than that. It could be kind of mid-single digits -- low- to mid-single-digit percent. As kind of Ellie mentioned, I think we will see, depending on what our product development needs are, but it's not going to be above overall kind of revenue growth. \r\nAnd then in terms of marketing, largely, we're going to keep marketing costs as a percentage of revenue largely the same as what it was in 2023. In some ways, we probably could see additional leverage on marketing. But what we've seen is such great success with our brand marketing efforts in our core markets, we're actually expanding to 20 countries around the world. So that's already included in this. \r\nAnd then we'll see as there are other investments to support the newer business areas. But to the extent that there may be any incremental marketing, it's not going to be a materially larger percentage of revenue than it was last year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank.\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCan you maybe spend some time talking through sort of the competitive dynamics and your expectations for the competitive set in the U.S. in 2024, particularly as some of your larger competitors look to lean into share gains? Are any of these investments in that holding share or any of these type of investments sort of aimed at defending share against a more competitive environment?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. We're going to continue to do what we're doing well, which is have unique supply that is outgrowing any of our competitors. And I think that by having that, we were able to drive kind of incremental nights and take share from both traditional hospitality and our competitors. I know competitors are trying to come into North America and take -- try to take additional share, which is not what we're seeing. We're not seeing success there. \r\nWe're seeing that a lot of the competition is focused on professional host supply, which is undifferentiated and often cross-listed. And I think the differentiated supply that we were able to bring on has been a material kind of net benefit to us. So that's where the strength we're seeing.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAnd I'll just add that we have a lot of competition for people choosing places to stay. Our main competition are hotels, first of all, and we're so much smaller than hotels. For every 1 that stays at Airbnb, 9 people stay in a hotel. So I think the bigger opportunity is for us to take market share because, again, all you need is one of them to come to Airbnb, and we've now doubled the size of our business. I think we are only scratching the surface. We grew in every region. We maintained or grew share in every region. \r\nAs Dave said, we have -- we are the brand in this category, a noun and a verb used all over the world. We are the only ones with a custom-built platform. And we're going to continue to strengthen our advantages, including like gas favor, the only one to offer that. The only one that offer custom built tools on the host side. So the best game we can play is to continue to focus executing ruthlessly. And if we continue to do that, we're going to continue to take share.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer.\n\nJed Kelly\n\nGreat. Just a couple. Just one, can you talk about how we think of -- we should think about demand and supply starting to converge? I know you've had great supply growth, up 18%. Should we start to see room nights catch up to that demand? And then can you just give us an update on the health of the U.S. short-term rental market, how you're thinking about that going into this year after what was the softness in a lot of those core vacation, rental, destinations last year?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. So why don't I just start, Jed, talking about supply growth, and I'll let Dave answer the rest. I believe in the long run that supply growth is a long-term indication of growth in Airbnb, and it's been healthy since we started the company. But you'll know that, during the pandemic, one of the biggest questions I got asked when supply growth stopped is how we're going to restart supply growth. \r\nThe great thing about our supply growth is that most of it comes organic to us. In fact, 36% of our new hosts are prior debt. That's the highest that number it's ever been. And the reason people host is because their friends typically tell them about it. The last year -- actually, the year before, we actually began, and we really put the throttle on it last year, a new strategic priority to mainstream hosting. \r\nAnd we did a few things. We really focused on making hosting easy to get started and increasing awareness. Now one of the reasons that we're so excited about the growth being 18%, and we hope it grows even faster is, as you know, the more supply you have, the more pricing pressure you relieve on the inventory. So when you're supply constrained, what you typically see is prices go up. When prices go up, nights growth is typically diminished. \r\nSo we believe that, again, the total addressable market for Airbnb stays is every single person with very few exceptions who stay in a hotel. So we can get the right supply at the right price then we believe we can capture that demand and build the company significantly larger. \r\nAdditionally, by having a surplus of supply, we think that, that will allow us to have even tighter quality control. So to answer your question, we do think that the healthy supply growth of 18% could be a great leading indicator down the road of where demand could be, and we'd love our supply to grow even faster.\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. I think what's also interesting is you actually back up and look out over multiple years. You go back 4 years or so and you look at the total amount of supply growth versus the total amount of nights growth, it's actually fairly consistent. So there are times that supply leads demand and times that demand leads supply. But I think, as Brian mentioned, over time, those things equalize out and the greater supply definitely helps our overall performance. \r\nI'd say, in terms of U.S. very specifically, a couple of things. Just we're seeing overall very stable growth in the U.S. We're seeing strong inbound cross-border growth in nights. And I think, unlike others that we're seeing in the U.S., we've seen very healthy growth in the nonurban markets, right? \r\nUrban markets have been traditionally our areas of strength, modern, and grew substantially kind of during COVID and coming out of COVID. We've continued to hold really great share and growth in the nonurban areas, and now urban is coming back stronger, and that has been our traditional area of strength. \r\nMaybe a last area is our long-term stays. So 19% of our stays were of 28 days or longer in the last quarter. So it was even up a little bit from 18% prior to that. I think there's a lot of critique of, well, long-term stays, that's a post-COVID benefit that's going to go away. Well, it's still materially bigger than it was back in 2019 when it was closer to 13%, 14% of our nights growth. So we're seeing really great strength there. So that's what we're seeing in North America.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Shubsda from JMP Securities.\n\nNicholas Freeman Jones\n\nHi, this is Nick Jones on. You talked a lot about focus on international expansion and kind of underpenetrated in many of these markets. You're rolling this playbook out, I think, it was Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands. Is this kind of the cadence we should expect the playbook to kind of continue to expand into additional countries? Is it kind of 3 or 4 at a time? And I guess, how are you balancing rolling this playbook out to more countries with kind of these new initiatives that we're looking forward to hearing from later in 2024?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. I think that's what you'll continue to see is that we're being very judicious about putting a small team on the ground in each of these locales, making sure that we have the full-funnel marketing approach working well, establishing what product adjustments might be unique to a specific location that's helpful. And then we're going to -- we're working down our list. What's the largest opportunity, what do we have the capabilities for and how do we kind of do it. \r\nNone of these are perishable things. We're just kind of working our way down kind of a prioritized list of our capabilities. And then this sets us up well as we expand on the quarter to make sure that we have a strong, established base of business to get the build from.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAnd I'll just add that, I think that there's some massive opportunities in front of us, especially with Asia. We really did focus on Korea, but I think the point that should be made is if you look at our penetration and, say, U.S., Australia, Canada, France and, to maybe a lesser extent, United Kingdom, they're significantly higher than other parts of the world. \r\nIn fact, in the United States, it's more than an order of magnitude higher penetration than Asia. There is no reason why we cannot get to today's U.S. penetration in the equivalent penetration in most of the major tourism markets around the world. And we think we're only scratching the surface in our mature market -- more mature market. So again, we are going to continue to add these countries one by one. \r\nBut the other thing is we're just getting started in Korea. We're just getting started in Germany. We're just getting started in Brazil. Brazil is now double the size of West pre-pandemic, but it's going to double again. And so we're going to continue. We have multiple phases of this playbook. And the first phase is playing out in Korea, Japan and Brazil, but we're going to go on to the next phase as we continue to add more countries.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho.\n\nJames Lee\n\nMy question is about booking window. I think in 1Q last year, booking window was extended as consumers tried to lock in high prices for accommodation. And just curious what you were seeing this quarter so far. Are you seeing any differences booking by region also? That would be helpful.\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. booking window has been relatively stable. We've kind of come back to a little bit more normal booking windows over time. So there's actually not a lot to say on it. It's pretty consistent now globally as things are returning to a more normal state.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan from Needham & Company.\n\nBernard Jerome McTernan\n\nBrian, just on cross-vertical. When you're talking about the new product initiatives, were you meaning more like a full OTA and thinking about cross-vertical in travel? Or was this more thinking about like Amazon, AWS moving beyond retail to all industries? And then bringing in more first-time bookers to the platform, any specific drivers there? Is that just international or anything else we should be aware of?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. Bernie, I think that Airbnb can go far beyond travel in the coming years. But I think we're going to start with our core. So I think what we're going to do is start with travel. And then down the road, we can move beyond travel. So you should -- we should start by seeing us do the things that are the most logical extensions of what we already provide, and then we will move further and further out from our core as the things we launch are successful. And then what was the second part of the question?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nWell, it's about first-time bookers and what -- where we see the growth of first-time bookers. I'll start, Brian, and you can round it out if I miss anything. But a key part is the reliability, making sure that they feel like we have -- that the service is going to be reliable. So things like air cover has been an area that we've been promoting to get people comfortable on booking Airbnb, doing things like reducing cancellations has been great, the work that we've done to make sure that prices are moderating. \r\nAnd then just general awareness, making sure that they're aware of it, which is the full-funnel marketing approach we do along these international countries. We're seeing strong -- strength in mobile downloads, as we highlighted at the top of the call, and just overall strong organic trends across the business.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes. I mean, I'll just like highlight a few things in addition what Dave said. I mean, first of all, our traffic and our top-of-funnel results are really good. And one of the reasons why is, number one, we're having a really successful advertising campaign. As you know, we have a very different approach to marketing than our competitors. We're not really typically trying to buy customers through performance marketing. We generally, as Dave mentioned, have a full-funnel approach, and we think of advertising more as education than sales. \r\nAnd one of the things we noticed was that we wanted to educate people about how there are some trips that are really just always better in Airbnb. If you're staying with -- if you're traveling with your family, if you're traveling with your groups, being able to share a house and have your own bedroom and save money, rather than getting different hotel rooms or crammed in 1 hotel room, makes complete logical sense. As we have this campaign running, it's called, Get an Airbnb. It's the most successful digital advertising campaign we've ever done, and it's now running on television. \r\nWe also are tapping into the biggest moment to pop culture. Last year, for example, the Barbie Movie came out, and we partnered with Mattel to turn a mansion in Malibu into a Malibu Barbie DreamHouse. That became a phenomenon on social media, and it got more press, more articles than our IPO. In fact, 3x as many articles were written about the Barbie Malibu DreamHouse as Airbnb's IPO, just to give you a sense. \r\nSo we have a lot of traffic coming to Airbnb. We're going to continue to hopefully stay relevant within culture. And if we can then convert that traffic, as Dave said, through product optimization, reliability efforts, improved customer service, then I think there's a lot of opportunities. And again, we have an entire road map, where you can just imagine hundreds of basis points of conversion of a nice growth increase through some of these efforts. So we've got a pretty big arsenal of levers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies.\n\nJohn Robert Colantuoni\n\nGreat. Just looking across your regions, EMEA is where you've sort of seen the biggest moderation incremental Nights and Experiences this year. I know there's some big travel markets where you're still underpenetrated, like Germany and now Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. Maybe you could talk to why consumer adoption has lagged in some European markets versus others? And any key areas of investments you still need to make to help drive adoption rates higher in that market?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. We continue to see strength in our growth in our more established markets, North America and Europe. But we're actually seeing still stronger growth relatively in Latin America and Asia. And so any kind of moderation is still just coming off of high overall growth. \r\nI mean, I'd say, APAC, we're really encouraged to see China outbound gathering kind of additional momentum. And we expect, by the end of the year, China outbound travel should be above 2019 levels. So I'd say that we're continuously great strength. And this international expansion playbook that we have, I think it's going to continue to be a tailwind for growth, especially in Latin America and Asia for the rest of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\n\nI'm sure you'll tell us more later this year, but could you talk about how you think about either the build by our partner strategy with respect to expanding beyond the core?\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nYes, absolutely. So I think one of the great things about Airbnb is that most of our innovation and most of our business is developed organically, and that just becomes part of our DNA. Like everyone was started by -- through product, people and engineers, chief designers and engineer. And we created -- Joe, Nate and I created this company from nothing with really no capital whatsoever to speak of. So I think build and the organic growth is in our DNA, and it's always going to be our predisposition. \r\nThat being said, with the scale that we have, the scale we have, having nearly 2 billion guest arrivals and more than 70 billion GBV, that is a huge asset to be able to partner. And a number of brands have reached out to us telling us they want to partner Airbnb, not just because of the traffic we have, but also because of the strength of our brand. So we think that there's a myriad of opportunities of partnership. \r\nNow in Dubai, we're going to be -- we're going to have a very high bar for ROI for acquisitions. We've done a number of acquisitions in the past. Some have been very successful. And with our free cash flow, we have generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow, we absolutely have the cash and, obviously, the currency of our stock to make acquisitions. But we're going to be very, very thoughtful, and it's always going to be build then partner then buy, probably in that order of prioritization.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\n\nLet me try 2 questions. There's some discussion in your shareholder letter about take rates. Just -- takes rates have been relatively consistent in the last couple of years. Is there any reason to think that, that pattern won't change going forward or will change going forward? Is there a reason why take rates would actually go up? \r\nAnd then secondly, Brian, you talked about the ability to really expand in Asia. And I don't know -- and I understand the momentum that you've got in Korea. Asia seems like it's generally been a tough market for a lot of Internet companies that tried to expand there. And there's -- China seems to be relatively off limits. So just talk through a little bit more about why you see grounds for optimism in that region. And I know there's a lot more to Asia than just China, but I wanted to ask that question.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nMark, yes, why don't I go -- do probably Asia and then Dave will take, take rate. So I mean, no doubt that Internet companies have struggled in Asia. I think, in particular, they struggled in China. And we do not have an inbound business, a domestic business in China any longer. Although, obviously, there's a lot of stories of companies doing well in other countries in Asia. \r\nSo let me just talk about why I think Airbnb is unique. The reason why, as you know, is that we're a global travel network. And so 44% of our Nights Booked were cross-border. And if you're in Japan and you want to stay in Germany, and you don't want to stay in a hotel, then who are you going to go? You're going to want to go to a global platform, probably not a Japanese platform. \r\nAnd the reason if you're going to Germany from Japan, and you're not going to use a Japanese platform because the Japanese platform would have to get German homes on that platform, and that is probably not going to happen. And so we think this is a global market, it's a global network, not a regional network. And one of the things we've noticed is that Airbnb seems to work about as well in every single country that we've entered. \r\nNow there's a big question about Latin America, for example, we were massively underpenetrated. And there was a question, well, this is an emerging market, will Latin America work well? And then, of course, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru have grown very, very quickly. And we -- and also, I'd just say, the success of Korea has been phenomenal. And the other thing is that the population in Asia is generally younger than the population in Europe and North America. \r\nAnd the other thing we know is that young people tend to gravitate more to Airbnb than older cohorts. So I just think the amount of people that are mobile applications, that are young, where every -- they're not predisposed to book a hotel, the strength of network effects, the fact that there's going to be really strong cross-border travel and Airbnb is a cross-border network are all the reasons why I think Asia will be no different than any other region in Airbnb. It might just take a little bit more time. Dave?\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. And then, Mark, in terms of take rates, no, there -- it should be consistent. There's no real reason why they should be going up on kind of a time-adjusted basis. We have not materially changed our pricing as a percentage of GBV when you adjust for the timing. \r\nSo we are testing the cross-currency fees, as we mentioned earlier in the call, but you shouldn't count that as a major expansion of fees this year. In Q1, the implied take rate revenue over gross booking value is going to be higher, but that, again, that's largely due to timing, right, a little more revenue coming in Q1 largely due to the Easter timing. \r\nSo now longer term, I am excited about the opportunity for revenue driving with our experiences and services and that ability to drive incremental revenue and incremental margin. So over a longer period of time, I think our margin expansion will absolutely come from hosting guest services and experiences. But here in the short term, there's no real change on a time-adjusted basis toward these.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Alex Brignall from Redburn Atlantic.\n\nAlex Brignall\n\nFirst one would just be on the Q1 guide. Just trying to understand what you're implying on the take rate expansion because there's obviously one comment, which is Easter timing, which is 1% to 2% on revenue. But it seems like the commented notably higher take rates would be more than just 1% to 2% extra on the revenues. So if you can just tease that out and then, obviously, it feeds back into the room nights. \r\nAnd the second one, just in terms of a little bit more detail on the cross-currency. It sounds like what you're saying is that it now is another lever that you have, which is fantastic, but it's something that you're going to test with. Is there an amount of friction that you expect when you add it? Do people have the chance to not pay the fee, where will it be displayed to consumers? And your last comment, Dave, on the take rate not expanding, but presumably, that means that in terms of its contribution to take rates, it's going to be relatively immaterial.\n\nDavid E. Stephenson\n\nYes. So there are 2 areas. The reason why we say the take rate expansion in Q1 is because there's a double hit. You have the increased revenue in Q1 due to the timing, and you have decreased gross booking value that shifts from Q1 to Q2. So you both increased revenue and decreased gross booking values in the period by some amount, say, 100 to 200 basis points, and then you get that greater expansion of fees, revenue over gross booking values. So that's why we give the guidance that way. Yes, in terms of cross-country -- cross-currency, we're going to be tough. We'll be launching in April. We need to understand what the impact is to demand overall. \r\nI mean if you just step back to it, it's actually a unique capability that the vast majority of other platforms either don't have or they charge a substantial premium for. So we've been largely giving away this benefit for no incremental cost, and we were just monitoring and have the capability of adjusting that fee if we so choose, and we will. But we'll be mindful about it to make sure that we're thoughtful in terms of the impact on overall demand.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Chesky for some closing remarks.\n\nBrian Chesky\n\nAll right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Just to recap, revenue was another incredibly strong quarter. Revenue was $2.2 billion, 17% higher. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q4 records, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow is $3.8 billion. And this, of course, represents a free cash flow margin at 39%. \r\nI'm really proud of what we've been able to accomplish this past year, and there's more to come. You know 2024 marks the beginning of a new chapter for Airbnb, and I look forward to sharing more throughout the year. Thank you all very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 14, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NIKE, Inc. NKE, Airbnb, Inc. ABNB, CVS Health Corp. CVS, ONEOK, Inc. OKE and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nQ4 Earnings Scorecard and Fresh Analyst Reports\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q4 earnings season, in addition to fresh analyst reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Airbnb, Inc. and CVS Health Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all of this morning's results, we now have Q4 results from 351 S&P 500 members or 70.2% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +5.6% from the same period last year on +3.7% higher revenues, with 79.5% beating EPS estimates and 64.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAs we have noted all along in our earnings commentaries, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates represent an acceleration relative to what we have been seeing from this group of index members in other recent periods. The EPS beats percentages are roughly in-line with historical averages, though the revenue beats percentage is tracking towards the lower end of the range over the preceding 20-quarter period.\n\nLooking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual resutls for the 351 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are on track to be up +5.5% on +3.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe Tech and Energy sectors are driving the Q4 growth pace in opposite directions, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector giving it a boost. Excluding the Tech sector's contribution, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -1.7% instead of up +5.5% as a whole.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nNIKE shares have modestly done better than the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the last six months (-0.4% vs. -5.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that continued progress on consumer direct acceleration strategy, compelling product innovation and digital leadership have driven the company\u2019s business. Robust consumer trends, including momentum in the NIKE mobile app led by improved traffic and increased member buying frequency have aided the digital segment.\n\nHowever, inflationary pressure and elevated expenses have been major headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NIKE here >>>)\n\nAirbnb shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Content industry over the past year (+27.3% vs. +19.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that improvement in booked Nights and Experiences, increasing guest demand and continuous recovery from the pandemic years in cross-border travel are benefitting the company. Strength in active listings owing to supply growth across Asia Pacific and Latin America have also aided.\n\nYet, great volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties, rising competition and impacts of geopolitical conflicts remain major concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Airbnb here >>>)\n\nShares of\u00a0CVS Health have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry over the past six months (+4.0% vs. -3.1%). Per the Zacks analyst, strong sales momentum across all three operating segments have been helping the company\u2019s topline. New acquisitions and fresh launches like Cordavis are also likely to boost future growth.\n\nHowever, decline in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing sales and persistent pharmacy reimbursement headwinds continue to impact business performance.\n\n(You can read the full research report on CVS Health here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ONEOK, Inc. and Arch Capital Group Ltd.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 14, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Cadence Design Systems CDNS, Shopify SHOP and Airbnb ABNB.\n\nWhich A.I. Stock Just Took a Dive? And Why?\n\nU.S. markets fell in the early going on Tuesday, reversing some of the gains from last week following a historic milestone for the S&P 500. We remain in the thick of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 800 companies reporting results this week. Earnings continue to be the focus heading into Tuesday\u2019s session along with this morning\u2019s key inflation report.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) data for January showed that both headline and core inflation came in above forecasts. On a monthly basis, headline CPI rose 0.3%, above expectations of a 0.2% rise. Despite an easing to a 3.1% year-over-year increase (from the 3.4% figure in December), the annual inflation rate came in ahead of the 3% projection.\n\nExcluding food and energy components, core inflation ticked up 0.4% month-to-month and 3.9% on an annual basis. Both figures exceeded estimates as well.\n\nThe hot prints across the board sent treasury yields higher and stocks lower this morning. The S&P 500 was down nearly 1.5% in the early going, while the Nasdaq had shed nearly 2%. Small-caps were particularly hit hard as the rate-cut outlook continues to be pushed back; the Russell 2000 index lost nearly 4% of its value.\n\nCurrent odds show just an 8.5% chance of a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in March. We heard from multiple Fed officials in recent days. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said that while recent inflation data has been mostly positive, the Fed is \u201cnot all the way there yet\u201d when it comes to tackling inflation. Meanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester stated that the Fed can begin to move rates lower \u201cif the economy evolves as expected.\u201d\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Marches On\n\nWe\u2019ve now received results from more than 60% of S&P 500 index members, and some important trends have emerged. The earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, fourth-quarter earnings are up 5.5% vs. this time last year on 3.7% higher revenues. This will be the second consecutive quarter of growth, after Q3 of last year officially halted the earnings recession trend.\n\nThe tech sector has been the main driver; had it not been for blowout numbers out of this sector (+21.9% for those companies that have reported thus far), S&P 500 earnings would be on track for a -2.7% drop. For the Magnificent 7 companies, total Q4 earnings are on track to be up 48.7% from the same period last year on 14.5% higher revenues.\n\nIn total, we have more than 800 companies reporting quarterly results this week. Combined with important economic data, it could be a market-moving week.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nIt\u2019s been a mixed showing in terms of reactions to earnings announcements. AI stock Cadence Design Systems, a leader in the electronic system design space, saw its stock fall nearly 7% this morning despite beating on both the top and bottom lines. The company reported non-GAAP earnings yesterday evening of $1.38/share, which marked an increase of 43.8% versus the year-ago period. Revenues of $1.069 billion jumped 18.8%. CDNS stock has since recovered some of the intraday losses and is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nSimilarly, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Shopify also saw its shares decline despite beating estimates after the bell yesterday. The cloud-based commerce platform provider came out with quarterly earnings of $0.34/share, ahead of the $0.31/share Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.68%. Revenues of $2.14 billion also topped forecasts by 3.66%. SHOP stock shed about 10% this morning but remains up about 3% this year.\n\nAfter the bell today, San Francisco-based Airbnb is set to deliver its fourth-quarter results. A leading platform for unique stays and experiences, Airbnb expects revenues between $2.13-$2.17 billion, implying year-over-year growth in a range of 12-14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.16 billion, indicating growth of 13.7% from the same period in the prior year.\n\nOur Q4 earnings estimate for ABNB of $0.67/share suggests growth of 39.6% from the year-ago period. Airbnb has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average beat of nearly 50% during that timeframe. ABNB is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy); the stock hit a 52-week high yesterday ahead of the release.\n\nVolatility is rising as we head into the latter half of February, so it\u2019s a good time to take partial profits on winning positions. As the week rolls on, be sure to keep abreast of the evolving earnings picture.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 most unfriendly countries in Asia. You can skip our detailed overview of countries that have low travel and tourism competitiveness, including visa acceptance rates, and directly head over to the 5 Most Unfriendly Countries in Asia.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the sustainable development of the travel and tourism sectors contribute to the economic development and competitiveness of countries. WEF\u2019s 2019 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report declared Europe and Eurasia as the most competitive regions in the world, followed by Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.\n\nAsia is the fastest growing region in the world, with its GDP contribution likely to account for 50% of the world economy by 2040. The economic opportunities offered by the continent have led to a mass influx of investors and job seekers from across the world to move to Asia. Moreover, the region is known for its warm climates, unique cultures and landscapes that have enhanced the continent\u2019s reputation as a growing tourist destination.\n\n2023 was a stellar year for tourism in Turkiye, where the number of travelers soared by 10.3% compared to the previous year, to a total of nearly 50 million. Ankara, this year, has waived off the requirement for American, Canadian, and Mexican tourists to obtain an e-visa for travel lasting fewer than 90 days. This is likely to further boost tourism in Turkiye. Seeing the country\u2019s appeal as a major tourist destination, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) \u2013 two giants in the hospitality industry \u2013 have announced expansion in Turkiye.\n\nWith over 100 active hotels and 20 more under development, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) is the largest hotel chain operating in Turkiye. Ramada by Wyndham Karapinar and Days Hotel by Wyndham Istanbul Esenyurt are some of the recently inaugurated projects by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) in the country. In September last year, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) announced its expansion in Turkiye with the signing of 13 different agreements, which would add another 2,000 rooms in the company\u2019s portfolio in the country, and also include the much-anticipated Fairfield Inn by Marriott. Currently, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) runs over 48 properties in the country, spanning across 8,000 rooms and 21 different brands.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year was exceptional for tourism in the United Arab Emirates as well, with over 17 million tourists visiting the country. Dubai, in particular, has earned the status of being one of the leading tourist destinations in the world due to its ultramodern architecture, luxury shopping, vibrant nightlife, and a local culture that embraces diversity. As a result, property and hospitality businesses are booming in this emirate.\n\nA UK-based study recently declared Dubai to be the most profitable city in the world for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) landlords. The average cost of rent per night in Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) properties close to the Burj Khalifa is as high as $1,150. According to the study, landlords who place their properties on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) are able to breakeven and make their money back in about four months on average.\n\nTurkiye and the United Arab Emirates are examples of how countries that have developed tourism industries and facilitate inbound traveling through high visa acceptance rates benefit economically. That being said, the welcoming and hospitable nature of locals toward tourists, immigrants, and expatriates has a pivotal role to play as well in defining the friendliness of a country.\n\nThere are several countries across the world, and in Asia, where travel policies are not as tourist-friendly, and where the travel and tourism industry is not developed enough for foreigners to travel to with ease. With that being said, we now shift our focus on some of the most unfriendly countries in Asia.  15 Most Unfriendly Countries in Asia\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have consulted three sources to rank the most unfriendly countries in Asia. These are our recent article, 25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World, World Economic Forum (WEF)\u2019s The Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019, and Passport Index\u2019s 2024 Welcoming Countries Rankings.\n\nIt was analyzed where countries ranked on each of these three sources, after which they were assigned scores for each metric. Finally, scores for each metric were aggregated to get an overall score. The 15 most unfriendly countries in Asia are listed in descending order of their overall scores.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 15 Friendliest Countries in Asia.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the unfriendliest countries in Asia.\n\n15. Lebanon\n\nScore: 0.84\n\nWe begin our list with Lebanon, a country that is located in a troubled region, with conflict on its doorsteps. Domestically as well, Lebanon is divided by a political system that is marred with institutional sectarianism. It was recently listed on seventh spot by Yahoo Finance and Insider Monkey for countries that dislike American tourists. The Passport Index has ranked Lebanon 43rd in its list of the most welcoming countries in the world, with Beirut offering visa on arrival or Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) entry to travelers from 103 countries.\n\n14. Turkmenistan\n\nScore: 0.81\n\nTurkmenistan is one of the most closed societies in the world, with limited press freedoms and strict regulations. Restrictions on independent travel and difficulties in obtaining visas have earned it the reputation of being among the most unfriendly countries in Asia. According to the Passport Index, Turkmenistan is among the least welcoming countries in the world, as it does not offer visa on arrival or eTA entry to travelers from any country.\n\n13. Brunei\n\nScore: 0.72\n\nBrunei is home to several beautiful landmarks, beaches, and rainforest. Despite that, it is among the least visited countries in the world. The World Economic Forum has ranked Brunei 72nd in the world for tourism and travel. The Passport Index has also listed the Asian country at 72nd spot in its ranking of the world\u2019s most welcoming nations. Passengers carrying passports of only 63 countries are eligible to receive visa on arrival or eTA entry in Brunei.\n\n12. Uzbekistan\n\nScore: 0.70\n\nDespite being home to numerous historical sites of Central Asia, Uzbekistan does not get many foreign tourists due to its underdeveloped tourism and travel infrastructure. Just over 3 million foreigners traveled to Uzbekistan for tourism purposes in 2023. It is one of the unfriendliest countries in Asia.\n\n11. Tajikistan\n\nScore: 0.66\n\nTajikistan is another Central Asian country on our list of the most unfriendly countries in Asia. It is among the least visited countries in the world, and most people would struggle to point Tajikistan on the map, as it often gets overshadowed by its larger neighbors like China, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan. The country offers visa on arrival service to passengers traveling from 87 countries \u2013 which has earned it 57th rank (out of 92) in Passport Index\u2019s list of the world\u2019s most welcoming countries. The WEF has ranked Tajikistan at 104 out of 140 countries for travel and tourism competitiveness.\n\n10. Myanmar\n\nScore: 0.65\n\nMyanmar is one of the most unfriendly countries in Asia. The country has earned an unfriendly reputation due to its long history (still ongoing) of political unrest, human rights abuses, and military coups. The country received only one million foreign arrivals in 2023 due to its strict travel restrictions. According to the Passport Index, Myanmar ranks 88th on the list of the world\u2019s most welcoming countries \u2013 with visa free entry (visa on arrival or eTA) offered to passengers carrying passports of only 11 countries.\n\n9. Mongolia\n\nScore: 0.59\n\nMongolia is one of the least welcoming countries in the world, offering visa on arrival or eTA services to passport holders of only 67 countries. It is listed at 93rd spot out of 140 countries on the WEF\u2019s ranking of countries' tourism and travel competitiveness. Most of the inhabitants in the country still practice a nomadic lifestyle, and the country\u2019s tourism industry is underdeveloped, and fairly new. Hardly 600,000 international travelers visited Mongolia in 2023.\n\n8. Kyrgyzstan\n\nScore: 0.58\n\nKyrgyzstan is one of the most unfriendly countries in Asia. It is listed 110th by the WEF for its tourism-friendliness. It ranks 60th on Passport Index\u2019s ranking of welcoming countries. That being said, the country\u2019s lakes and mountains are a tourist attraction, and the tourism industry is gradually beginning to show signs of growth. Nearly seven million people traveled from foreign countries to Kyrgyzstan in 2023.\n\n7. Kuwait\n\nScore: 0.52\n\nNext up among Asia\u2019s unfriendliest countries is Kuwait, which in 2022 was declared as the worst destination in the world for expatriates by Expat Insider. The country ranked last among all 52 countries surveyed, with expats responding that they were fed up with their quality of life in Kuwait and termed the locals as \u2018unfriendly\u2019. The Passport Index has also ranked Kuwait as one of the least welcoming countries in the world, with only passport holders from 58 countries being offered visa on arrival or eTA entry services in the country.\n\n6. Iraq\n\nScore: 0.46\n\nIraq claims sixth spot in our list of the most unfriendly countries in Asia. It was recently ranked as the eighth least friendly in the world by Yahoo Finance and Insider Monkey. The country has been a high-risk region for quite some time due to the long-going civil unrest and terrorist activities. It is ranked 80th (out of 92) on Passport Index\u2019s list of the most welcoming countries.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Unfriendly Countries in Asia.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Most Unfriendly Countries in Europe 20 Most Dangerous Countries in Asia 25 Countries That Dislike American Tourists\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Most Unfriendly Countries in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Airbnb Sees Demand Moderating as Chesky Readies for Pivot",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Airbnb Inc. ended 2023 stronger than analysts\u2019 had expected but suggested that demand in the current quarter wouldn\u2019t be as robust as the last. The shares fell in late trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Caught Off Guard by \u2018Sticky\u2019 CPI Signs: Markets Wrap Musk Says Putin Can\u2019t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate Bill Putin Seeks Revenge on a World Order He Once Wanted to Join US Inflation Tops Forecasts in Blow to Fed Rate-Cut Hopes Retail Traders Are Losing Billions in India\u2019s Booming Options Market\n\nRevenue for the three months ending in March will be $2.03 billion to $2.07 billion, surpassing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.02 billion. The number of nights and experiences booked is expected to moderate compared with the fourth quarter, however, due to a particularly strong growth rate a year ago, the home-sharing company said Tuesday in a letter to shareholders.\n\nTravel was especially strong last year after the Omicron wave of Covid-19 but the company is starting to see overall demand normalizing coming out of the pandemic, Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson told analysts on a call.\n\nThe shares tumbled 5% in extended trading, after initially rising as much as 11% on the results. The stock has gained 30% in the past 12 months and hit its highest price in almost two years on Monday. The home-sharing platform also reported a surprise net loss in the quarter, due to a one-time tax charge related to a long-running dispute with the Italian authorities.\n\nStill, Airbnb\u2019s quarterly results beat analysts\u2019 estimates on many metrics and Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky was optimistic about where the company is headed, especially in international markets.\n\n\u201cThere are massive opportunities in front of us,\u201d Chesky said on the call. After spending the past few years adjusting to shifts in travel trends from the pandemic, the CEO said he\u2019s ready now to \u201cexpand beyond our core business and reinvent Airbnb.\u201d It will be a \u201cgradual, multi-year journey,\u201d and he pledged to share more towards the end of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nChesky has hinted that the new ventures would include further integrations of artificial intelligence and third-party services into its products, which would allow more personalized travel recommendations for guests and better user experience for hosts.\n\nThe company had warned in November that it was seeing \u201cgreater volatility\u201d globally early in the last quarter, due to economic and geopolitical issues. But then, bookings accelerated throughout the rest of the year. \u201cGuest demand remains strong \u2014 especially among first-time bookers,\u201d Airbnb said in the letter.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s results suggest there is still pent-up travel demand, especially in regions that were slower to return to normal life after Covid-era lockdowns. Airlines, hotels and and other travel companies, including Airbnb, saw record demand over the summer, a phenomenon dubbed \u201crevenge travel,\u201d as people proved willing to swallow high fares for flights and lodging to fulfill their lost pandemic itineraries.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter jumped 17% to $2.22 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $2.16 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nights and experiences booked increased 12% to 98.8 million, also ahead of expectations for about 11% growth. Airbnb said the results were boosted by a \u201cmodest increase\u201d in the average daily rate and a favorable foreign exchange rate.\n\nChesky sees markets outside the US one of Airbnb\u2019s biggest growth opportunities and the San Francisco-based company is planning to boost its presence in about a dozen countries such as Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands in the coming years. Airbnb has been working to adapt its app to the local market and raise awareness to drive traffic and is starting to see the effort pay off.\n\nGross nights booked in Brazil nearly doubled compared with the same pre-pandemic period in 2019, the company said. The Asia Pacific region was one of the last globally to emerge from Covid lockdowns and cross-border travel is continuing to recover there. Nights and experiences booked increased 22% in the area from a year earlier and Latin America saw similar growth.\n\nAirbnb said it\u2019s \u201cparticularly excited for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\u201d It\u2019s already seen an increase in supply and demand and the current backlog of nights in Paris during the summer is more than double a year ago. The company has said it expects to host half a million people in the City of Lights.\n\nThe company posted a net loss of $349 million in the fourth quarter, due to non-recurring tax withholding expenses and lodging tax reserves of about $1 billion as a result of a 2017 Italian tax law that it fought and later settled last December. Excluding that, adjusted net income was $489 million.\n\nAirbnb, which went public in 2020, also announced a new share repurchase program to buy back as much as $6 billion of the company\u2019s stock.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s results contrast with Expedia Group Inc., which owns the Vrbo vacation-rental site. Last week Expedia gave an outlook for gross bookings in the current quarter that disappointed investors, sending its shares tumbling the most in almost four years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdobe\u2019s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into Everything Can I Hire My Crush?

I think the question remains around what drives that kind of pricing tailwind we saw during the pandemic, and the tougher comps will really put question marks around their ability to sustain high teens to over 20% growth which they have done since the pandemic.

It made a GAAP loss of $0.55 per share, down from its profit of $0.47 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Airbnb? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.22 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.16 billion (2.5% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $738 million vs analyst estimates of $646 million (14.2% beat) EPS: -$0.55 vs analyst estimates of $0.55 (-$1.10 miss due to a one-time \"lodging tax reserves and reserves for host withholding taxes\" charge) Free Cash Flow of $46 million, down 96.5% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 82.7%, up from 81.9% in the same quarter last year Nights and Experiences Booked: 98.8 million, up 10.6 million year on year\u00a0(0.7% beat vs. expectations of 98.1 million) Market Capitalization: $98.57 billion\n\nFounded by Joe Gebbia and Brian Chesky by renting out a blowup bed on the floor of their San Francisco apartment, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is the world\u2019s largest online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays.\n\nOnline Marketplace\n\nMarketplaces have existed for centuries. Where once it was a main street in a small town or a mall in the suburbs, sellers benefitted from proximity to one another because they could draw customers by offering convenience and selection. Today, a myriad of online marketplaces fulfill that same role, aggregating large customer bases, which attracts commission-paying sellers, generating flywheel scale effects that feed back into further customer acquisition.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAirbnb's revenue growth over the last three years has been exceptional, averaging 58.6% annually. This quarter, Airbnb beat analysts' estimates and reported 16.6% year-on-year revenue growth. Airbnb Total Revenue\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsage Growth\n\nAs an online marketplace, Airbnb generates revenue growth by increasing both the number of bookings on its platform and the average order size in dollars.\n\nOver the last two years, Airbnb's nights booked, a key performance metric for the company, grew 23% annually to 98.8 million. This is strong growth for a consumer internet company. Airbnb Nights and Experiences Booked\n\nIn Q4, Airbnb added 10.6 million nights booked, translating into 12% year-on-year growth.\n\nRevenue Per Booking\n\nAverage revenue per booking (ARPB) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Airbnb because it measures how much the company earns in transaction fees from each booking. Furthermore, ARPB gives us unique insights as it's a function of a user's average order size and Airbnb's take rate, or \"cut\", on each order. Airbnb ARPB\n\nAirbnb's ARPB growth has been decent over the last two years, averaging 7%. The company's ability to increase prices while constantly growing its nights booked demonstrates the value of its platform. This quarter, ARPB grew 4.1% year on year to $22.45 per booking.\n\nKey Takeaways from Airbnb's Q4 Results\n\nIt was great to see Airbnb beat analysts' revenue expectations this quarter on better-than-expected 'Nights & Experiences Booked' (a key volume metric). On the other hand, its revenue growth slowed. Additionally, the company guided to adjusted EBITDA margins of \"at least 35%\" due to investments in \"incremental growth opportunities\", below expectations of a margin slightly over 36%. Zooming out, we think this was a decent, albeit mixed, quarter. The guidance may be weighing on shares. Investors were likely expecting more, and the stock is down 4.1% after reporting, trading at $144.68 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Airbnb right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

        "content": "Airbnb said Tuesday that it lost $349 million in the fourth quarter due to an income tax settlement with Italy, but bookings and revenue rose, and the short-term rental giant said demand remains strong.\n\nThe company forecast first-quarter revenue that would meet or beat Wall Street expectations.\n\nHowever, the pace of bookings growth is likely to \u201cmoderate\u201d from the fourth quarter into the first, and the early timing of Easter could hurt growth in the second quarter, Airbnb said.\n\nCEO Brian Chesky said on a call with analysts that Airbnb is \u201cperfecting\u201d its business \u2014 making pricing more transparent, reining in exorbitant cleaning fees, and reducing cancellations by hosts. Now it plans to go beyond its core.\n\nChesky said the company will build out its rental platform in countries where it isn\u2019t as strong as the United States. He said that is already underway in Germany, Brazil and South Korea, and will soon be tried in Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cBut this is only one piece of a much bigger strategy because we have always believed that Airbnb was destined to offer more than just a place to stay,\u201d he said.\n\nChesky, however, gave no details about the \u201cmultiyear journey,\u201d only promising news late this year. Rivals such as Vrbo parent Booking Holdings and Expedia Group also make money from things like flight and rental-car listings.\n\nThe fourth-quarter loss compared with a profit of $319 million a year earlier. The recent results were dragged down by $1 billion in one-time tax withholding expenses and lodging tax reserves.\n\nThe vacation-rental platform disclosed in December that it would pay Italy's tax agency 576 million euros ($621 million at the time) to a case involving withholding from property hosts in that country. Airbnb not admit wrongdoing, and company officials say they don't fact any similar liability in other countries.\n\nExcluding the special expenses, Airbnb said it would have earned $489 million.\n\nRevenue rose 17% to $2.22 billion, beating the $2.17 billion forecast of analysts in a FactSet survey. Bookings rose 12%, and the average daily rate gained 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirbnb forecast first-quarter revenue of between $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion. Analysts were looking for $2.03 billion.\n\nThe company said demand remains strong, especially among new users of the site. Bookings grew 12% from a year earlier, and picked up after \u201cvolatility\u201d in October, when economic uncertainty and the start of war in Israeli-occupied Gaza raised doubts about travel demand.\n\nAirbnb said its growth is picking up in less mature or \u201cunder-penetrated markets\" including Brazil, where bookings made inside the country have nearly doubled since late 2019.\n\nThe value of gross bookings, at $15.5 billion, was slightly higher than the $15.2 billion forecast among analysts.\n\nThe San Francisco company added nearly 1.2 million listings last year, pushing its total to more than 7.7 million, with the fastest growth rates in Asia Pacific and Latin America.\n\nThe company said its board approved a share-repurchase program of up to $6 billion.\n\nShares of Airbnb Inc. initially jumped in after-hours trading Tuesday, but then drifted lower, falling 5% two hours after the end of regular trading.",

        "title": "UPDATE 1-The new normal: travel companies temper expectations for 2024",
        "content": "(Adds consumer spending details in paragraph 11, details from Airbnb earnings in paragraph 12)\n\nBy Doyinsola Oladipo\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The buzzword from travel companies for 2024 is \"normal.\"\n\nAfter the pandemic slammed the brakes on the tourism industry, and the subsequent years were the era of \"revenge travel,\" hotel operators Hilton Worldwide and Marriott International and online travel agency Expedia expect demand to grow more slowly this year.\n\nThey, along with other travel companies, are forecasting full-year 2024 profits short of the consensus from Wall Street analysts. That has been a disappointment to investors, as people had been making more room in their spending budgets for vacations and hotel stays.\n\n\"We expect travel demand to remain relatively healthy, but we expect growth rates across the world to decelerate,\" Expedia Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern told investors on a call.\n\nMarriott told investors that it expects 2024 revenue per available room, a closely watched industry metric for hotels' top-line performance, to increase between 3% and 5% this year, after nearly 15% growth in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, Hilton expects full-year room revenue to rise between 2% and 4% in 2024, down from a 12.6% increase in 2023.\n\n\"The rebound impact from the pandemic has waned,\" Marriott's CEO Anthony Capuano told investors on a call.\n\nSo far this year, Marriott and Hilton shares have risen 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively, after gains of 51.46% and 44.10% in 2023.\n\nThe U.S. hotel industry notched new records for the average daily room rate and revenue per available room, according to commercial real estate analytics firm CoStar, but that may not be repeated this year. Average U.S. revenue per available room in 2023 was $97.97, up 4.9% from 2022. Average daily rates rose 4.3% to $155.62, according to CoStar.\n\nDespite expectations for travel costs to rise 3.5% year-over-year in 2024, travelers have an average of about 4.9 trips planned per person, a 2% rise above 2019 levels, according to a survey of over 500 U.S. travelers by Jefferies.\n\nStory continues\n\nShort-term rental company Airbnb forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as it expects a boost from strong cross-border travel.\n\nHowever, the company expects the growth rate of nights booked in the quarter to moderate compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Average daily rates for the quarter are expected to be flat or slightly up year-over-year, the company said.\n\nOne laggard for hospitality companies has been China, but the hotel giants were more optimistic about that country's growth for the coming year as well as rebounding group and business travel.\n\n\"For the hotel industry, 2024 will be the first normal year we've seen since 2019,\" said Patrick Scholes, Truist equity analyst. \"The last market still needing to catch up is China.\"\n\nHilton forecast 2024 adjusted profit between $6.80 and $6.94 per share, below the analyst consensus for $7.07, while Marriott's range was $9.18 to $9.52 per share, versus expectations for $9.69 per share, LSEG data showed.\n\nAirfares are also expected to soften, analysts said, as excess domestic capacity has weakened the pricing power of air carriers.\n\nIn January, domestic airfare averaged $273 per round-trip ticket, up 1.8% from 2023 but down 2.2% from 2019, according to data from travel booking app Hopper. Expedia said it expects revenue growth in 2024 to be in the mid-single digits after a 10% increase in revenue in 2023, and it said pricing should be soft across several categories in 2024. The company's gross air bookings were partially affected by lower average ticket prices and continued pressure on car rental rates.\n\nInvestors will get another look at how the accommodations sector performed in the fourth quarter when vacation rental company Airbnb reports earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n\n(Reporting by Doyinsola Oladipo in New York; additional reporting by Aishwarya Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "content": "Revenue: Q4 revenue increased by 17% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. Net Income (Loss): Q4 net loss of $349 million, including non-recurring tax expenses. Adjusted EBITDA: Q4 Adjusted EBITDA rose to $738 million, up 46% from Q4 2022. Free Cash Flow: Q4 Free Cash Flow was $46 million, impacted by non-recurring tax items. Gross Booking Value (GBV): GBV increased by 15% year-over-year to $15.5 billion in Q4. Nights and Experiences Booked: Reached 98.8 million in Q4, a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with ABNB. Airbnb Inc (ABNB) Posts Mixed Q4 Results Amidst Strong Travel Demand\n\nOn February 13, 2024, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) released its 8-K filing, revealing a mixed performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company, known for its global online marketplace for lodging and experiences, reported a 17% increase in Q4 revenue to $2.2 billion, driven by robust travel demand and favorable foreign exchange rates. However, the quarter also saw a net loss of $349 million, largely due to approximately $1 billion in non-recurring tax withholding expenses and lodging tax reserves. Excluding these items, the adjusted net income was a profitable $489 million.\n\nFinancial Highlights and Strategic Developments\n\nAirbnb's Q4 performance reflects the ongoing recovery and strength in the travel sector. The company's Gross Booking Value (GBV) grew by 15% year-over-year to $15.5 billion, with Nights and Experiences Booked increasing by 12% to 98.8 million. This growth was consistent across all regions, with the Asia Pacific and Latin America showing the strongest performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $738 million, representing a significant increase from the previous year and indicating disciplined cost management. Free Cash Flow (FCF) stood at $46 million, affected by the aforementioned tax items, yet the full-year FCF reached $3.8 billion, demonstrating a healthy 39% FCF Margin.\n\nAirbnb's strategic initiatives in 2023 included efforts to make hosting mainstream, perfecting the core service, and expanding beyond the core. The company's host community surpassed 5 million hosts globally, with active listings exceeding 7.7 million by the end of 2023, an 18% increase from the previous year. Hosts earned over $57 billion in 2023, and Airbnb plans to continue enhancing the host experience and raising awareness about hosting in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also focused on improving its core service by launching over 430 new features and upgrades, which led to a 36% decrease in host cancellations in Q4 compared to the same period in 2022. Additionally, Airbnb is investing in under-penetrated international markets, seeing positive results in countries like Germany, Brazil, and Korea, and plans to expand its playbook to other countries.\n\nFinancial Tables and Analysis\n\nThe financial tables included in the earnings report highlight key data such as revenue, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and share repurchases. Airbnb repurchased $750 million of its Class A common stock in Q4, with full-year 2023 repurchases totaling $2.25 billion. The company also announced a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $6 billion of its Class A common stock.\n\nDespite the net loss for the quarter, Airbnb's strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management, and robust free cash flow generation underscore the company's solid financial position. The company's strategic investments in its platform and international expansion are poised to drive future growth, although challenges such as regulatory hurdles and market volatility remain.\n\nFor more detailed insights and financial analysis, investors are encouraged to review the full 8-K filing and consider the company's performance in the context of the broader travel and leisure industry.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Airbnb Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Airbnb Reports Surge in Hosts and Listings: Does This End the Supply Debate?",
        "content": "Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky at Skift Global Forum in September 2022. Source: Skift Skift\n\nOne potential issue with Airbnb\u2019s growth plans has been whether it could boost its ranks of hosts and listings enough to meet the demand from guests around the world.\n\nAfter several years of advertisements and programs to bring on new hosts, Airbnb did much to answer that question Tuesday.\n\nAirbnb said it added more than 1 million active listings in 2023: The total is now around 7.7 million, up from 6.6 million at the end of 2022.\n\nAnd it has a roster of more than 5 million hosts, a jump of about 1 million. For the fourth quarter, Airbnb said its supply increased 18% year-over-year, with all regions growing by double-digit percentages.\n\nThere are still challenges, of course. Adding more than 1 million hosts and another 1 million listings doesn\u2019t mean there will be enough to go around for this summer\u2019s Paris Olympics, or for Myrtle Beach on July 4th weekend. And a chunk of those listings are duplicates, inflating that 7.7 million number.\n\nStill, the growth is impressive.\n\nItaly Tax Dispute Led to Fourth-Quarter Loss\n\nItaly\u2019s tax on short-term rentals was the major contributor to Airbnb\u2019s fourth quarter turning red.\n\nWithout admitting wrongdoing, Airbnb in December settled a tax probe in Italy for $620 million covering 2017-2021. The dispute grew out of a 2017 law that required Airbnb to withhold 21% of hosts\u2019 rental income and to remit it to Italian authorities, who claimed Airbnb was evading taxes.\n\nAirbnb said one-time expenses for tax withholding and reserves for taxes amounted to $1 billion. That led to a net loss of $349 million in the quarter. That compared with $319 million in GAAP net income a year earlier.\n\nFor full-year 2023, however, Airbnb\u2019s net income grew 152% to $4.8 billion.\n\nAirbnb Says It\u2019s Keeping Rates Low for Guests\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter climbed 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by 12% growth in nights and experiences booked and what the company described as a \u201cmodest\u201d boost in average daily rates.\n\nThat modest boost was less than 1% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period. Airbnb claimed hotel average daily rates rose about 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Small Percentage of Hosts Removed or Lowered Cleaning Fees\n\nAirbnb said 300,000 listings \u2013 about 3.8% of the total \u2014 removed or lowered cleaning fees since the company began displaying the total price before taxes in the U.S. and elsewhere (the EU has had the feature for several years) early in 2023. The company said 40% of active listings don\u2019t charge a cleaning fee.\n\nUrban Stays Are Still Well Below Pandemic Levels\n\nAirbnb stays in urban areas accounted for 51% of gross nights booked in the fourth quarter, well below the 59% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Still, stays in high-density locales jumped 11% in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat Happened to Airbnb \u2018Expanding Beyond the Core\u2019\n\nAirbnb said it is expanding in Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands, following growth in Germany, Brazil and South Korea in previous quarters.\n\nInterestingly, Expedia Group explicitly tells financial analysts that it wants to be opaque about which new markets it is pursuing for competitive reasons. But Airbnb doesn\u2019t have much hesitation in identifying them.\n\nIn the past couple of years, Airbnb has talked about \u201cexpanding beyond the core,\u201d including broadening its geographic footprint, but also selling various new services to hosts.\n\nThe latter initiative \u2014 becoming a platform to sell various add-on services to hosts \u2014 hasn\u2019t happened yet but is likely in the works.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s Outlook\n\nAirbnb projected revenue of $2.03 billion to $2.07 billion for the first quarter of 2024, a year-over-year jump of 12-14%.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.",

        "content": "Tuesday, February 13, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the ongoing Q4 earnings season, in addition to fresh analyst reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Inc. (NKE), Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nQ4 Earnings Seaosn Scorecard\n\nIncluding all of this morning's results, we now have Q4 results from 351 S&P 500 members or 70.2% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +5.6% from the same period last year on +3.7% higher revenues, with 79.5% beating EPS estimates and 64.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAs we have noted all along in our earnings commentaries, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates represent an acceleration relative to what we have been seeing from this group of index members in other recent periods. The EPS beats percentages are roughly in-line with historical averages, though the revenue beats percentage is tracking towards the lower end of the range over the preceding 20-quarter period.\n\nLooking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual resutls for the 351 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are on track to be up +5.5% on +3.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe Tech and Energy sectors are driving the Q4 growth pace in opposite directions, with the Energy sector dragging it down and the Tech sector giving it a boost. Excluding the Tech sector's contribution, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -1.7% instead of up +5.5% as a whole.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nNIKE shares have modestly done better than the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the last six months (-0.4% vs. -5.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that continued progress on consumer direct acceleration strategy, compelling product innovation and digital leadership have driven the company\u2019s business. Robust consumer trends, including momentum in the NIKE mobile app led by improved traffic and increased member buying frequency have aided the digital segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, inflationary pressure and elevated expenses have been major headwinds.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on NIKE here >>>)\n\nAirbnb shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Content industry over the past year (+27.3% vs. +19.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that improvement in booked Nights and Experiences, increasing guest demand and continuous recovery from the pandemic years in cross-border travel are benefitting the company. Strength in active listings owing to supply growth across Asia Pacific and Latin America have also aided.\n\nYet, great volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties, rising competition and impacts of geopolitical conflicts remain major concerns.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Airbnb here >>>)\n\nShares of CVS Health have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry over the past six months (+4.0% vs. -3.1%). Per the Zacks analyst, strong sales momentum across all three operating segments have been helping the company\u2019s topline. New acquisitions and fresh launches like Cordavis are also likely to boost future growth.\n\nHowever, decline in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing sales and persistent pharmacy reimbursement headwinds continue to impact business performance.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on CVS Health here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ONEOK, Inc. (OKE), Imperial Oil Limited (IMO) and Arch Capital Group Ltd. (ACGL).\n\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Investors might want to bet on Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Airbnb, Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Airbnb, Inc. imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Airbnb, Inc.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this company is expected to earn $8.40 per share, which is a change of 201.1% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Airbnb, Inc. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.2%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Airbnb, Inc. to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This week\u2019s earnings lineup will be highlighted by several growth stocks with none standing out more than Airbnb ABNB and DaVita DVA.\n\nBoth are solid growth options among the technology sector and medical sector respectively with now appearing to be a good time to buy as their Q4 results approach on Tuesday, February 13.\n\nAirbnb Q4 Preview\n\nAirbnb\u2019s expansion has started to justify its hype as a leading platform to book unique or more intimate stays outside of common hotel offerings. Adding nearly 1 million global listings over the last year Airbnb\u2019s strong momentum is expected to continue following a record travel season for the company during the third quarter.\n\nFourth quarter sales are projected to rise 14% to $2.16 billion and EPS projections of $0.67 a share would represent 39% growth. Airbnb is now expected to round out fiscal 2023 with total sales climbing 17% to $9.86 billion and annual earnings skyrocketing 201% to $8.40 per share. Furthermore, Airbnb has surpassed earnings expectations for 10 consecutive quarters posting a very impressive average earnings surprise of 49.99% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDaVita Q4 Preview\n\nDaVita has remained one of the most intriguing healthcare companies due to its expansion as a dialysis services provider throughout the United States. With its growth prospects seemingly essential to society DaVita\u2019s stock also stands out in terms of value.\n\nTo that point, DaVita\u2019s stock trades at a very reasonable 12.9X forward earnings multiple with Q4 EPS anticipated at $1.53 a share and up 38% from $1.11 per share a year ago. Plus, Q4 sales are expected to rise 3% to $3 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDaVita is now projected to end FY23 with total sales up 3% to $12 billion and annual EPS expanding 22% to $8.07 per share. Notably, DaVita has beaten earnings expectations in each of its last four quarterly reports posting an average earnings surprise of 36.55%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nAt the moment Airbnb and DaVita\u2019s stock currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) attributed to their intriguing growth narratives and annual earnings estimate revisions remaining higher for both companies over the last 90 days. It would be no surprise if Airbnb and DaVita\u2019s stock drift higher in the coming weeks if they can reach or exceed their lofty growth projections for Q4; especially if this is accompanied by positive or better-than-expected guidance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Earnings season isn\u2019t over yet. There are hundreds of companies expected to report this week including big technology companies, popular growth stocks and a lot of consumer-focused companies that soared during the pandemic but which are now trying to adapt to the post-pandemic world.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to beat every quarter, or nearly every quarter for years. Few companies have done so.\n\nBut all 5 of these featured companies have solid earnings surprise track records with one being an earnings all-star. It hasn\u2019t missed in the last five years, which is impressive as that includes the quarters when Covid hit and upended the global economy.\n\nWill these companies beat again?\n\nAnd will it be a catalyst for the shares to rally?\n\nThis Week\u2019s 5 Must-See Earnings Charts\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB)\n\nAirbnb has an excellent earnings surprise track record. It has only missed one time since its 2020 IPO and it was the very first quarter as a public company. Otherwise, Airbnb has beat 11 quarters in a row.\n\nShares of Airbnb are trading near 1-year highs, up 36%. But they still aren\u2019t back to all-time highs hit in 2021. Airbnb has a forward P/E of 33.4.\n\nWill Airbnb break out to new multi-year highs on this report?\n\n2. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD)\n\nRobinhood has a solid earnings surprise track record. It has only missed 3 times since its 2021 IPO and has put together 3 beats in a row.\n\nShares of Robinhood are down 5.6% year-to-date but have rallied 20.5% over the last year to near 52-week highs. Robinhood isn\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis, however. It trades with a forward P/E of 77.\n\nWill Robinhood get its mojo back as the stock market keeps hitting new highs?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sony Corp. (SONY)\n\nSony has an incredible earnings surprise track record with just 2 misses in the last 5 years. It has put together 6 beats in a row.\n\nHowever, even with such a consistent record, this Japanese tech and entertainment giant is up just 6.5% over the last year, which is underperforming the S&P 500 which is up 23%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSony trades with a forward P/E of 19.5, cheaper than its US peers but not cheap compared to value stocks, which normally trade under 15x.\n\nShould investors have Sony on their short list?\n\n4. Albemarle Corp. (ALB)\n\nAlbemarle has an outstanding earnings surprise track record as it\u2019s only missed two times in the last 5 years. However, one of those misses was last quarter.\n\nShares of Albemarle have been hammered over the last year as the price of lithium has fallen. Albemarle is down 55% during that time. Earnings are now expected to decline 69.5% in 2024.\n\nAre the lithium mining stocks like Albemarle oversold?\n\n5. Twilio Inc. (TWLO)\n\nTwilio is an earnings all-star. It has not missed in 5 years. That\u2019s impressive.\n\nHowever, shares of Twilio have underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year, gaining 20.5% versus 23% for the S&P. Twilio is down 2.5% year-to-date.\n\nIs Twilio cheap? It trades with a forward P/E of 30 but 2024 earnings are expected to rise 10.1%.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity in Twilio?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Midway through the current earnings reporting period, companies have been delivering results exceeding market expectations. As we forge ahead, now is the right time to discuss which stocks to watch this week.\r\n\r\nA trend observed during this earnings season is the increase in stock buybacks, a strategy executives employ to goose stock prices. So far in 2024, the daily average value for announced buybacks has reached $6.9 billion, surpassing the prior 4-year average of $6.5 billion for the same period. Firms expected to announce buybacks will likely draw additional interest, making good candidate stocks to watch this week.\n\nWith American consumers showing a proclivity towards budget brands as inflation continues to bite, budget alternative stocks could outperform. The travel sector is one of the outliers within the cash-conscious environment, with travel and tourism names exceeding forecasts. This points to some promising stocks to watch this week.\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) is poised to report its Q4 earnings on February 15, making it one of the stocks to watch this week. Those seeking clues about the food production industry are eagerly anticipating the company\u2019s results. Additionally, the purchasing patterns for lawn care equipment could mirror the spending capacity of American consumers. For example, those with surplus cash may opt to buy new lawnmowers. However, tight household budgets could postpone upgrading of equipment for a later period. High interest rates have already impacted the company, leading farmers to delay the purchase of new equipment in hopes of more favorable loan options arising. As such, DE will be one of the interesting stocks to watch this week.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts forecasts indicate a 20% drop in EPS from the year before to $5.16 billion, with lower sales of $10.3 billion. Aside from expectations, crop prices have seen a downturn lately, and Deere\u2019s results are often seen as an indicator of the agricultural sector\u2019s health, which feeds into food price inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will likely focus on the company\u2019s outlook and prospects of policy easing for gauging the potential growth across industrial agriculture sales.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock investors must watch this week is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), the staple soft drink manufacturer. The reason is similar to that of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) attracting attention. As one of the most frequently purchased products globally, KO\u2019s sales fluctuations can provide key insights into evolving consumer sentiment and the general perception of the economy. That makes KO another one of the stocks to watch this week.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s multinational presence, investors analyze how KO performs in regional divisions to discern varying economic conditions between the U.S. and other major markets. The upcoming quarterly results will be scrutinized for any evolution in demand patterns.\n\nAnalysts forecast a 6.7% surge in Coca-Cola\u2019s profits, reaching $0.48 EPS, with a 5.1% revenue increase to $10.6 billion. However, a rise in sales or prices could drive a market reaction. If Coca-Cola appears to encounter challenges in passing on higher costs to consumers, it would suggest a drop in U.S. consumer sentiment. Overall, several reasons exist to consider adding KO to the list of stocks to watch this week.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), among tech companies releasing earnings this week, could draw extra scrutiny. As a hotel alternative, ABNB frequently indicates travel demand, disposable income and how the housing market does. Given the numerous factors, it\u2019s safe to say that Airbnb is one of the stocks to watch this week.\n\nForecasts suggest the company will report a significant rise in EPS of 43.8% to $0.69. A revenue increase of 13.7% to $2.16 billion is also expected. Investors might look to determine whether the growth stems from market expansion or rising rental prices. Yet, the company\u2019s outlook is where attention will likely be more intense to gauge the company\u2019s ability to maintain demand throughout the year. Social chatter has been lively around increasing fees from hosts, with many curious to see what steps Airbnb might take to regain a positive brand image.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Price and EPS Surprise Airbnb, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAirbnb, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Airbnb, Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nAirbnb\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 results are expected to have benefited from the solid momentum in Nights and Experiences booked across all geographies, owing to growing demand among first-time bookers.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Nights and Experiences Booked is pegged at 97.85 million, indicating growth of 10.9% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nFurther, the growing Average Daily Rate, driven by a mix shift across EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, is expected to have impacted the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum across international expansion markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, is likely to have aided cross-border travel growth during the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nAll these factors are expected to have driven growth in gross booking value (GBV) in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GBV is pegged at $15.12 billion, indicating growth of 12% from the reported figure in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s growing awareness around hosting and new features introduced for hosts are likely to have acted as tailwinds for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum in active listings, owing to supply growth across all regions, is expected to have bolstered the company\u2019s top-line performance during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nHowever, intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have remained an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, growing macroeconomic challenges and the impacts of geopolitical conflicts may have been major concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Airbnb this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nAirbnb has an Earnings ESP of -0.82% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies worth considering from the same space, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their soon-to-be-reported quarterly results.\r\n\r\nShopify SHOP has an Earnings ESP of +1.02% and a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nShopify is set to announce fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 13.

        "title": "3 Revolutionary Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation",
        "content": "Regardless of the ups and downs of the stock market, companies with innovative businesses driving change in their respective industries present compelling opportunities for investors. If you're on the hunt for these types of businesses to buy as 2024 kicks off, you don't have to look far to find intriguing investment opportunities that can make wise additions to your portfolio for the long term.\n\nHere are three such stocks to consider hitting the buy button on before 2024 gets any further.\n\n1. Intuitive Surgical\n\nIntuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG) is trading up by roughly 60% from its position one year ago. About a third of that share price gain has been realized since the start of 2024. The company dominates the surgical robotics space globally, and has done so since its first da Vinci surgical system was approved more than two decades ago.\n\nIntuitive Surgical sells several models of its flagship da Vinci surgical system, which is approved for use in a wide range of minimally invasive surgeries. It also has the Ion system in its portfolio, which has non-surgical use cases as it is approved specifically for minimally invasive lung biopsies.\n\nBroadly speaking, Intuitive's business focuses on five surgical areas: urologic surgeries, cardiothoracic surgeries, head and neck surgeries, general surgeries, and gynecologic surgeries. Based on currently approved uses for its systems, management has noted that there are more than 70 clinical uses for its various da Vinci surgical system models.\n\nEven as hospital systems and other medical providers are spending more cautiously in the current macroeconomic environment, Intuitive Surgical's installed base of systems has been growing at a steady clip, driving revenue and profits skyward.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Intuitive Surgical reported that it had 8,606 da Vinci surgical systems installed globally. The lion's share of those systems -- 5,111 to be exact -- are installed in the U.S., while 1,617 are in Europe, 1,484 are in Asia, and 394 are distributed across other client markets. That overall installed base figure of 8,606 systems was up 14% from one year ago, and a whopping 54% from four years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntuitive brought in revenue of $7.1 billion in 2023 and earnings of $1.8 billion -- increases of 14% and 35%, respectively. A rock-solid healthcare business with a robust runway for growth still ahead, and solid footing in a wide addressable market isn't always easy to find. In Intuitive Surgical's case, this company is waving multiple green flags that may entice investors to scoop up some shares.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb(NASDAQ: ABNB) is trading up by a double-digit percentage year to date, and has risen by close to 30% over the trailing 12 months. The travel platform continues to rake in revenue, profits, and cash flow at an enviable clip, and at a far higher rate than many other growth-oriented businesses. There are likely multiple reasons behind this overall resilience.\n\nAirbnb serves both sides of the travel accommodation dynamic. On the one side, it provides a platform for hosts around the world to list their homes and properties, while on the other side, guests with just about any type of travel requirement can find accommodation to suit their needs. In the third quarter, active listings jumped 19% year over year, while guests booked 113 million nights and experiences, a 14% increase. Meanwhile, Airbnb hosts earned more than $19 billion.\n\nAirbnb started releasing biannual platform upgrades two years ago, and has launched hundreds of additional features since that time. Recent upgrades include better pricing tools for hosts, reduced prices on long-term stays, new categories of cost-effective stays, and improvements to search tools. Airbnb is benefiting from a strong recovery in cross-border travel, but it's also witnessing steady gains in markets that were previously underpenetrated by its platform. For example, gross nights booked in Korea in the third quarter were 54% higher than in the same quarter of 2019, before the pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the flexibility of Airbnb's platform as well as the benefits it offers to both hosts looking to make an income and guests searching for any variety of stays, the company facilitates these bookings at very little overhead cost. Airbnb doesn't own the properties listed on its platform. This asset-light model is continuing to drive meaningful growth on the top and bottom lines.\n\nRevenue rose 107% from four years ago to $3.4 billion in Q3, while net income for the three-month period totaled $4.4 billion, compared to a profit of $266 million four years ago and a profit of $1.2 billion one year ago. There's a lot of growth opportunity left for this business within the broader travel space, and its differentiated platform is driving incredible profitability. Investors may want to take advantage of this buying opportunity before the stock shoots higher.\n\n3. Upstart\n\nUpstart Holdings(NASDAQ: UPST) is down so far in 2024 although the fintech stock is up by an eye-popping figure of more than 100% over the past year. The company has reported significant declines in revenue as well as a lack of profitability in recent quarters due to a steep downward trajectory in loan volume.\u00a0 Elevated default rates, higher interest rates, and the overall heightened lending risks are making lenders more hesitant to fund loans than they were in the past, and consumers are more hesitant to apply for loans as well.\n\nThis has created a perfect storm for many companies with broad exposure to the lending space. Upstart is no exception. The company primarily makes money from fees attached to servicing loans, so of course when loan volume and funding are down, this is going to have a deleterious impact on its balance sheet. It's also important to note that the decrease in loan volume on Upstart's platform isn't just a function of the macro environment as a whole, although default trends are undeniably a key factor here.\n\nUpstart isn't your average lending platform. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to evaluate would-be borrowers based on over 1,500 variables that its model uses to determine their creditworthiness. Because this model considers many factors beyond those that go into the traditional FICO score, Upstart has been able to approve more loans than the average bank at lower annual percentage rates, but without hurting its lenders' risk profiles. In turn, lenders have gained access to previously untapped pools of potential creditworthy borrowers.\n\nGiven the ongoing risk baked into the macro environment, Upstart's model is approving far fewer borrowers now. These elements will take time to adjust, but given how Upstart's model calibrates to the environment at hand, more favorable lending tailwinds should gradually right the ship. Loan volume was up 5% sequentially in the most recent quarter. Model accuracy is also key to Upstart's growth. Its personal lending platform recently experienced the most significant upgrade in five years, improving model accuracy by around 15%.\n\nIn the meantime, more lenders are joining Upstart's platform, and it is growing an active presence in various lucrative areas of the multi-trillion dollar addressable lending market, including auto loans, personal loans, and mortgages. The next several quarters could still be pretty ugly. However, the potential of this business, which has few direct rivals that compete at its scale, could make it worth scooping up even a modest position as part of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intuitive Surgical wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Upwork UPWK is set to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 14.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Upwork anticipates revenues between $175 million and $180 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $178.43 million, suggesting 10.52% growth from the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings are expected in the range of 16-18 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged at 17 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating growth of 325% from the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nMarkedly, Upwork\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 326.89%.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.\n\nUpwork Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Upwork Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nUpwork Inc. price-eps-surprise | Upwork Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nUpwork\u2019s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from take rate expansion due to strength in the company\u2019s ads products, its shift to a simplified, flat-fee pricing structure for freelancers and other monetization strategies implemented in 2023 to drive enhanced value and efficiency in the Marketplace business.\r\n\r\nThe total take rate in the third quarter was 17.1%, up from 16.3% in the previous quarter and 15.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nUpwork is a standout in the world of freelance work, connecting businesses of all shapes and sizes with people around the globe.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s top line is expected to have been aided by strong active client growth, driven by improved client retention and client acquisition in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the third quarter, active clients increased 2% year over year and quarter over quarter to approximately 836,000.\r\n\r\nManaged Services is expected to have been positively impacted by clients moving from an Enterprise plan to a Managed Services plan.\r\n\r\nThis online talent marketplace provider has been striving hard to attract large business organizations to hire freelance talent through its Work Together Talent Grants program. A surge in hiring of freelance talent as businesses resort to stringent cost-saving practices is expected to have resulted in healthy adoption of UPWK\u2019s services in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nUpwork signed 23 new Enterprise clients in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 21% sequential increase over new Enterprise client additions in the second quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nHowever, management remains cautious about some of the existing clients as they might curb spending on talent acquisition. Moreover, increased spending on product innovation is likely to have been a drag on profitability in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that\u2019s not the case here.\r\n\r\nDatadog has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter Airbnb reported revenues of $3.40 billion, up 17.8% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company. Nights and Experiences Booked (key measure of volumes) grew but missed expectations slightly. However, revenue beat by a bit. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter underwhelmed.\u00a0The company reported 113.2 million nights booked, up 13.5% year on year.\n\nIs Airbnb buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Airbnb's revenue to grow 13.8% year on year to $2.16 billion, slowing down from the 24.1% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year.

        "title": "Inflation, retail sales, and corporate earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed above 5,000 for the first time ever on Friday as the three major averages logged a positive week for the 13th time in the last 14 weeks.\n\nWith few economic catalysts in the past week, investors have been digesting a slew of corporate results that have come in better than expected. Meanwhile, commentary from Federal Reserve officials largely reiterated the central bank's stance that more confidence in inflation's path downward is needed.\n\nThe week ahead will bring new challenges to the market rally, though, with a fresh reading on inflation and consumer spending highlighting the economic calendar. On the corporate side, about 15% of the S&P 500 is set to report earnings headlined by John Deere (DE), Coinbase (COIN), Airbnb (ABNB), and Shopify (SHOP).\n\nPrice check\n\nTuesday morning will bring investors the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January. Wall Street expects an annual gain of 2.9% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, a noted decrease from the 3.4% headline number in December. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, in line with December's rise.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the food and energy prices, inflation is expected have risen 3.7% year-over-year, a slowdown from the 3.9% increase seen in December. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, unchanged from the month prior.\n\n\"We expect more core goods deflation this month, mainly driven by weak used car prices,\" Morgan Stanley economist Diego Anzoategui wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \"Gradual deceleration is confirmed, but services inflation remains sticky with some deceleration in rents inflation but a slight rebound in insurance prices and hotels.\"\n\nState of the consumer\n\nPart of the soft-landing thesis that's taken over markets in the past few months has been consistent stronger-than-expected data on consumer spending. A fresh reading on that trend is set to greet investors on Thursday with the January retail sales report. Economists expect retail sales declined 0.2% in January from the prior month.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen is anticipating a \"soft\" print due to seasonal factors and widespread winter storms that likely disrupted retail spending in January. But Gapen doesn't believe this changes the overall narrative for the consumer.\n\n\"Sifting out the noise, however, the consumer looks healthy, with upside risks to spending from accelerating real wages,\" Gapen wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe real wages metric Gapen references, which is the wage Americans see after subtracting headline inflation from their wage growth, was recently listed in the Yahoo Finance Chartbook as a reason the US economy has skirted recession amid higher interest rates.\n\nA final look at traditional autos\n\nAfter Tesla's (TSLA) earnings report disappointed investors, traditional automakers Ford (F) and GM (GM) surprised to the upside. Stellantis (STLA), the parent company of Chrysler and Fiat, is on deck to report Thursday, making it the last Big Three automaker to report earnings this cycle.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: While the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that lingered into October will likely hit operating margins, Stellantis is expected to see revenue jump over 5% to 189.3 million euros, and adjusted net income to climb 9.7% year over year to 18.4 billion euros, per Bloomberg estimates.\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares was criticized in the past for not moving faster with the company\u2019s EV transition; now he is looking prescient as demand for EVs has seemingly waned in recent months. Shares of fellow Big Three automakers Ford and GM have surged following strong earnings reports, as the two Michigan-based automakers\u2019 traditional gas-powered businesses are projecting robust profits for 2024.\n\nInvestors will be looking for Stellantis to offer more of the same with an outlook that sees profit growth and limits EV capital expenditure outlays.\n\nEarnings breadth expands\n\nBroadly earnings have been coming in increasingly positive. With 75% of S&P 500 companies havingreported earnings, the benchmark index is on pace to report its second straight quarter of earnings growth. And, notably, analysts see earnings growth continuing throughout the next two years.\n\nIn a note to clients on Friday, Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha highlighted that 83% of US companies are beating earnings estimates. Per Chadha's research, this is the highest mark in two years and \"well above the upper end of its pre-pandemic range.\" It's also significantly higher than the beat rates in other countries, which could be an indicator of why US stocks are outperforming other markets.\n\n\"Such elevated beats have historically been seen only in the early stages of recovery from major cyclical downturns,\" Chadha wrote.\n\nSeveral strategists recently noted a similar trend to Yahoo Finance when explaining how the S&P 500 could rise to new highs later this year without outsized contributions from a few large tech stocks that have been driving the market action as of late.\n\n\"As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we'll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, January (3.01% previously)\n\nEarnings:Avis Budget Group (CAR), Monday.com (MNDY), Waste Management (WM), Zoominfo Technologies (ZI)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, January (91.9 previously) Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, January (+0.2% expected, +0.3% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, January (+2.9% expected, +3.4% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, January (+3.7% expected, +3.9% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, January (+0.8% previously)\n\nEarnings: Airbnb (ABNB), AutoNation (AN), Biogen (BIIB), Coca-Cola (KO), Datadog (DDOG), Hasbro (HAS), Instacart (CART), Marriott International (MAR), Lyft (LYFT), MGM Resorts (MGM), Moody's (MCO), Robinhood (HOOD), Shopify (SHOP), Upstart (UPST), Zillow Group (ZG)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Feb. 9 (+3.7%)\n\nEarnings: Albermarle (ALB), Cisco (CSCO), CME Group (CME), Generac (GNRC), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental (OXY), Sony (SONY), Sunoco (SUN), Twilio (TWLO)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 10 (218,000 previously); Retail sales, month-over-month, January (-0.2% expected, +0.6% previously); Retail sales ex auto and gas, January (+0.2% expected, +0.6% previously); Import prices, month-over-month, January (-0.1% expected, +0.0% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, January (-3.2% previously); Industrial production, month-over-month, January (+0.4% expected, +0.1% previously); NAHB housing market index, February (44 prior)\n\nEarnings:Applied Materials (AMAT), Coinbase (COIN), Crocs (CROX), DoorDash (DASH), DraftKings (DKNG), John Deere (DE), Penn National (PENN), Oatly (OTLY), Roku (ROKU), Stellantis (STLA), The Trade Desk (TTD), Toast (TOST), Wendy's (WEN), Yeti (YETI)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Producer Price Index, month-over-month, January (+0.1% expected, -0.1% previously); PPI, year-over-year, January (+1% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, February preliminary (79.0 expected, 79.0 previously); Building permits month-over-month, January (1.5% expected, 1.8% previously)\n\nEarnings: Air Canda (ACDVF), Cinemark (CNK)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 friendliest countries in Asia. You can skip our detailed analysis on countries that welcome tourists, expatriates and immigrants with open arms, and head over directly to the 5 Friendliest Countries in Asia.\n\nTraveling abroad, whether for tourism or starting a new life, is a unique experience. While tourists have several expectations associated with visiting a country, such as architecture, landscape, culture, cuisine, shopping and more, it is often their experience with locals that has a long-lasting impact on the perception they develop of that place.\n\nAsia is the fastest growing region in the world, with its GDP projected to account for over 50% of the world\u2019s GDP by 2040. The continent offers immense economic potential, which has seen a large influx of investors and job seekers move to Asia with an eye on the lucrative opportunities available in these large, densely populated markets. Moreover, Asia is also famous for its unique landscape, cultures, and warm climates, which have enhanced the region\u2019s reputation as a growing tourist destination.\n\n2023 was an exceptional year for tourism in Asia, especially UAE, which received over 17 million tourists. The UAE is the second most welcoming country in the world for immigrants as well, with a migrant stock in the population of 88.1%. Tens of thousands of people flock to the country every year for job hunt in search for better wages and living standards than in their home country.\n\nSeveral large corporations operate in the country and contribute to its economic success. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expecting its cloud portfolio to create 100,000 new jobs and add $39 billion to the Emirati economy between 2022 and 2026. The US technology company is in talks with UAE officials on the potential use of its cloud based services in highly regulated sectors of the government. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans on spending $3.4 billion to support local businesses and data centers in the UAE.\n\nStory continues\n\nProperty business is thriving as well in the UAE. According to a UK-based study, Dubai is the most profitable city in the world for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) landlords, with homeowners charging as much as $1,150 a night on average in properties near the Burj Khalifa. The study mentioned that it would take landlords an average of 121 nights to rent out their property on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) to breakeven and make their money back. Vietnam\u2019s capital Hanoi was listed as the third most profitable city for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) landlords.\n\nAnother top destination for travelers is Turkiye, where the number of tourists soared by 10.4% in 2023, to touch nearly 50 million visitors. Last month, Ankara eliminated the requirement for US, Canadian, and Mexican tourists to obtain e-visa for travel lasting fewer than 90 days. The move is likely to further boost tourism in the country. Turkiye\u2019s appeal as a major tourist destination has meant a booming hotel industry, with large chains like Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) having announced expansions in the country.\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) is the largest international hotel company operating in Turkiye, with more than 100 active hotels, and about 20 more under development in the country. Recent additions by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE:WH) in Turkiye include the Days Hotel by Wyndham Istanbul Esenyurt and Ramada by Wyndham Karapinar, among others.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in September 2023 announced the signing of 13 deals, signaling its expansion in Turkiye. The company currently has a portfolio of 8,000 rooms across 21 brands and 48 properties in the country. According to Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), the new projects \u2013 which would include the much anticipated Fairfield Inn by Marriott \u2013 will add another 2,000 rooms.  15 Friendliest Countries in Asia\n\nPatryk Kosmider/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe friendliest countries in Asia were ranked after considering four sources \u2013 Yahoo Finance and Insider Monkey\u2019s articles on 30 Friendliest Countries in the World and 20 Most Immigrant Friendly Countries In The World, HSBC\u2019s Expat Explorer rankings that list the top 46 destinations for expat living, and Passport Index\u2019s Welcoming Countries Rank 2024, which ranks countries on how many passports they accept visa-free, with visa on arrival or Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).\n\nWe observed where every Asian country ranked on each of these lists, and assigned them scores by dividing their rank on each list with the total number of countries ranked on those lists.

        "title": "3 Disruptive Stocks That Could Redefine Their Industries by 2025",
        "content": "In the stock market, fortunes and theories are made and shattered, a few companies stand to redefine the core of their industries. For instance, when hospitality transcends traditional boundaries, healthcare becomes seamlessly accessible, and telecommunications takes on new disruption connectivity. Within this space, three companies emerge as galaxies in the sky among the stars.\n\nImagine the first one: a platform for lodging on a global scale, shaping the very essence of travel and accommodation. Consider the second one: a healthcare provider disrupting digital wellness and revolutionizing how the world accesses and experiences healthcare. And then there\u2019s the third: a telecommunications company, a pioneer of connectivity, forging enhanced communication and collaboration.\n\nThe article delves into the strategies of these transformative entities, dissecting their performance and trajectories. Read more to learn the potential they hold for investors and industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb\u2019s (NASDAQ:ABNB) strong performance is a fundamental edge supporting its rapid value growth potential. The company constantly grows revenue, attains considerable net income, and generates substantial free cash flow. For instance, in Q3 2023, the 18%\u00a0year-over-year revenue growth indicates Airbnb\u2019s adaptability.\n\nEven after adjusting for one-time tax benefits, the massive net income reflects Airbnb\u2019s edgy cost management strategies. Specifically, attaining an adjusted net income margin of\u00a047% reflects the company\u2019s capability to transmit a large fraction of revenue into profit. Furthermore, Airbnb\u2019s solid free cash flow for Q3 and on a trailing 12-month basis highlights its capability to breed liquidity beyond its operational requirements. The decision to repurchase over $500 million of its stock points to management\u2019s view on Airbnb\u2019s valuation prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Airbnb\u2019s growth in both supply and demand metrics suggests its ability to scale its platform and attract users globally. The expansion of active listings by nearly 1 million reflects the company\u2019s lead in onboarding new hosts and diversifying its accommodation offerings. With a 19% increase in supply year-over-year, Airbnb builds its capacity to meet growing demand.\n\nFurthermore, the record travel season experienced by Airbnb in Q3 suggests the resilience of its business model. It also reflects the enduring appeal of its platform to travelers. The\u00a014%\u00a0growth in nights and experiences booked signifies strong demand across geographies.\n\nFinally, the significant increase in mobile bookings, with 53% of gross nights booked through the Airbnb app, signifies the effectiveness of Airbnb\u2019s mobile strategy in driving user adoption and engagement. Overall, these developments may continue to boost Airbnb\u2019s valuation.\n\nTeladoc Health (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeladoc Health\u2019s (NYSE:TDOC) top-to-bottom line performance is a value plinth. The company\u2019s capability to deliver topline growth reflects the solid demand for digital health solutions. For instance, in Q3 2023, Teladoc Health delivered a revenue growth of 8%\u00a0year-over-year (hitting $660 million). This growth suggests the company\u2019s capability to capture a larger market share (digital health).\n\nIn detail, Teladoc Health\u2019s Integrated Care segment\u2019s revenue grew by 9%\u00a0year-over-year. This segment holds a range of healthcare services, including chronic care, primary care, and specialty care. The prolonged growth in integrated care revenue suggests the elevated adoption of Teladoc Health\u2019s edgy healthcare solutions (by both healthcare providers and direct consumers).\n\nOn the other hand, the BetterHelp segment focuses on virtual mental health services. This segment delivered revenue with an 8% year-over-year increase. This growth suggests the expanding recognition of the importance of mental health. It also reflects the effectiveness of teletherapy in providing accessible and convenient mental health support. As awareness of mental health issues increases, Teladoc Health may continue to capitalize on this trend.\n\nFinally, Teladoc Health has experienced considerable enrollment growth in its chronic care programs, with enrollments exceeding\u00a01.1\u00a0million active users. These programs concentrate on managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and weight issues. Teladoc Health has simplified contracting by stacking multiple chronic care programs into a single offering. Therefore, these developments may continue to enhance engagement and outcomes.\n\nCrexendo (CXDO) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrexendo\u2019s (NASDAQ:CXDO) solid topline growth reflects the company\u2019s strategic positioning in the competitive market (telecommunications). For instance, in Q3 2023, there was a 52%\u00a0year-over-year revenue increase, which leveled at $13.8 million. This growth demonstrates Crexendo\u2019s capability to capture market share and capitalize on emerging demand.\n\nAdditionally, the boost in service revenue by\u00a068% (to $7.5 million) suggests the demand for Crexendo\u2019s service line. The company\u2019s lead in this segment suggests its efficiency in delivering solutions in line with the market\u2019s needs.\n\nMoreover, the diversification of revenue streams is a vital strength for Crexendo. The company\u2019s software solutions revenue lifted by 21% year-over-year, with product revenue delivering a solid 119% year-over-year increase. This diversified approach neutralizes the risks of relying on a single revenue stream, supporting Crexendo in generating sustained growth.\n\nAt the bottom line, Crexendo\u2019s progressive expansion serves as a driver of value growth. The overall gross margin improvement from\u00a058% in Q2 to 61% in Q3 2023 reflects the company\u2019s adeptness in managing costs and optimizing its strategic pricing.\n\nSimilarly, segment-wise margin enhancements, especially the expansion of Software Solutions margins from 67% to 72%, suggest Crexendo\u2019s edgy costing strategies. Furthermore, the improvement in product margins from 38% to 45% reflects the lead of initiatives to push product profitability up.\n\nAs a result, Crexendo\u2019s capability to turn around net income from a loss of $696K in Q3 2022 to a positive $1.7 million in Q3 2023 is a vital shift. From a valuation perspective, this shift towards positive net income suggests a translation of revenue growth into improved profitability. Hence, the turnaround in net income is a vital indicator of Crexendo\u2019s value expansion.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in TDOC.

        "content": "The 2023 Q4 earnings season continues to chug along, with this week\u2019s reporting docket notably busy. The period has primarily been positive so far, supported by the technology sector\u2019s strong performance and growth.\n\nAnd next week, the party continues, with another fresh slate of companies scheduled to unveil quarterly results. Concerning a few notable names, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Crocs CROX, and Airbnb ABNB are all on the docket. Crocs reports on 2/15, and Coca-Cola and Airbnb report on 2/13.\n\nBoth ABNB and CROX shares have outperformed relative to the S&P 500 in 2024, whereas KO shares have seen slight positivity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBut how do expectations stack up heading into the releases? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nA peer of KO, PepsiCo PEP, recently unveiled its quarterly results, with shares facing selling pressure following the release. Concerning headline numbers for PEP, the company posted a 3.5% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and fell short of revenue expectations.\n\nThe unfavorable reaction PEP shares saw post-earnings is likely a reflection of slowing growth as consumer spending behavior shifts back to pre-pandemic norms. Still, PEP expects its categories to perform well throughout 2024, with the company also announcing a 7% boost to its quarterly payout.\n\nAnalysts have been silent about headline expectations for Coca-Cola, with the $0.48 per share consensus estimate unchanged since last November and reflecting 7% growth. Revenue expectations have also primarily remained stagnant, expected to climb 5% from the year-ago period.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s earnings consistency shouldn\u2019t be overlooked, exceeding both consensus EPS and revenue expectations regularly. Shares got a solid boost post-earnings following its latest release, snapping a streak of back-to-back adverse reaction prior.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConsumer spending habits will be highly watched within KO\u2019s report, with margins also remaining critical.\n\nAirbnb\n\nAirbnb\u2019s leading platform provides a marketplace for connecting hosts and guests online or through mobile devices to book spaces and experiences. Analysts have taken their expectations lower for the quarter to be reported, with the $0.67 per share consensus estimate down 4% since last November.\n\nEarnings growth looks to remain robust, as the value suggests a 40% climb year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning Airbnb, Gross Booking Value (GBV) and Nights and Experiences Booked are two key metrics investors focus on. Regarding GBV, the Zacks Consensus Estimate presently stands at $15.1 billion, suggesting growth of 12% year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, ABNB has consistently posted favorable GBV results as of late, beating consensus expectations in three consecutive releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, we expect Nights and Experiences Booked to reach 98 million, an 11% improvement year-over-year. ABNB has fallen short of expectations on this metric as of late. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile the expected growth is strong, it represents a deceleration from previous quarters.\n\nCrocs\n\nCrocs is one of the leading footwear brands, focusing on comfort and style. Analysts have been notably bullish for the upcoming print, taking the $2.37 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate 8% higher since last November. The value suggests a 10% pullback from the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestors will be interested to see how the company\u2019s brands have been performing, including HEYDUDE footwear. The Crocs brand has shown considerable growth, with sales climbing nearly 12% Y/Y throughout its latest period.\n\nFor the upcoming release, we expect the company to post $723 million in revenue from its Crocs brand, reflecting growth of 9%. CROX has exceeded this metric consistently as of late. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning the HEYDUDE brand, the Zacks Consensus estimate of $226 million suggests a decline of nearly 19% from the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season continues at a rapid pace, with a wide variety of companies delivering results daily.\n\nAnd concerning next week\u2019s docket, three reports to watch out for will come from The Coca-Cola Co.

        "title": "What to Watch: Airbnb Earnings",
        "content": "Airbnb (ABNB): A company that\u2019s become so synonymous with travel and leisure. \u2018Airbnbing\u2019 is now a verb in its own right. The last time the booking platform reported a solid performance, it was overshadowed by a less than rosy outlook for the fourth quarter. So what should you look out for this quarter? Here are the three things you need to watch.\n\n#1 Booking Growth:\n\nLooking out for two key metrics: first \u2014 gross booking value. That\u2019s the total amount of payments processed on the platform: everything from host payments to cleaning fees, but it does not include cancellations. Last quarter gross booking value \u2013 landed over 18 billion dollars, 17% gain from the prior-year. Then \u2013 there\u2019s nights and experiences booked: the platform reported over 100 million bookings for the quarter \u2013 which topped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Now \u2013 as we turn to the fourth quarter \u2014 the revenue figure will be closely watched, as the company guided a little below expectations.\n\n#2 International Expansion:\n\nIn the last quarter \u2013 Airbnb said their expansion plans into international markets is \u2018gaining momentum\u2019. Keep an eye on what it is called \u2018under-penetrated markets\u2019 \u2014 that means a market with little competition for the same service. Asia Pacific is one, but also take into account markets like Germany, Brazil and Korea. Beyond that, its an important to have a pulse on *anything* the company has to say about AI, and how it could be a game changer for international growth in the coming months.\n\n#3 Regulation:\n\nAnother key area to watch. In the third quarter, Airbnb slightly saw higher prices for short-term rentals - but this area could be hurt by changes in the regulatory landscape. For example \u2013 New York City\u2019s new law \u2014 requires all short-term rental hosts to register with the city, they must show when their guests are staying - and only two guests can stay at a time. This applies to all other platforms like VRBO and Booking.com. The big question here, will other cities follow suit and what could it mean in the long- term? There\u2019s a lot to digest as we look at Airbnb's fourth quarter earnings, and Yahoo Finance will be tackling the latest developments.",

        "title": "Airbnb investor rips South Lake Tahoe short-term rental ban, saying it just lets \u2018wealthy people get good deals on second homes that mostly sit around vacant\u2019",
        "content": "A self-described \u201cvacation rental investor\u201d and \u201cproprietor of fine Airbnbs\u201d blasted South Lake Tahoe\u2019s short-term rental ban yesterday in a post on X with over a million views.\n\nRohin Dhar, who claims to have Airbnbs in Sonoma, Kauai, Taos, Mount Hood, Yosemite, and Asheville, wrote that the resort city\u2019s near total ban implemented more than five years ago created a \u201cshort-term rental Armageddon.\u201d However, instead of easing the housing affordability crisis within the city, he claims, \u201chome prices cratered, and people scooped them up as second homes,\u201d and he claims that some of them are sitting empty.\n\n\u201cThere is still a housing affordability crisis \u2026 When a resort area bans Airbnb, the only thing that happens is wealthy people get good deals on second homes that mostly sit around vacant,\u201d Dhar wrote on the social media platform, mocking the so-called Measure T.\n\nMeasure T was a citizen-initiated ballot measure intended to regulate vacation or short-term home rentals in South Lake Tahoe, as the city\u2019s website states. It went into effect at the end of 2018 and required the phasing-out of all vacation home rental permits in residential areas and across all multifamily properties over a three-year period. Of course, it also prohibited new vacation home rental permits in residential areas. But Measure T doesn\u2019t apply to existing or future short-term rentals in nonresidential areas\u2014and some people can still rent their homes, if they\u2019re a permanent resident and are renting their entire home for up to 30 days a year.\n\nIn the summer of last year, an appeals court upheld Measure T\u2019s ban on short-term rentals after the South Lake Tahoe Property Owners Group filed a lawsuit\u2014although one issue, regarding permanent residents\u2019 ability to rent their homes, was sent back to trial court, according to the Tahoe Daily Tribune, a local paper.\n\nFrom the end of 2018 to the end of last year, home prices in South Lake Tahoe rose roughly 42% to an average home value of $649,322, per Zillow (although they are down over the past year). The median rent for all bedrooms and all property types in the city is $2,975, which is close to 50% higher than the national median.\n\nStory continues\n\nA recently published opinion piece in the Tahoe Daily Tribune written by Amelia Richmond, president of Locals for Affordable Housing, pushed for a vacancy tax, claiming, \u201cAs home prices have doubled in the last decade, a staggering 44% of all housing in South Lake Tahoe\u2014over 7,000 homes\u2014now sit empty most of the year. Since 2000, the increase in vacancies has outpaced new housing construction, resulting in more vacant houses and fewer homes for residents.\u201d The housing crisis, she wrote, was pushing locals out of town.\n\nClearly there\u2019s still an issue of affordability, one that must have been worsened by the pandemic-fueled housing boom, which sent home prices up substantially nationwide, followed by a surge in mortgage rates. But it\u2019s important to note that some research has shown that Airbnbs can impact long-term rentals. One paper, for instance, found that a short-term rental ordinance in a city in southern California led to a 2.7% decline in contracted long-term rental prices on average\u2014meaning, that when you take Airbnbs away, generally rents go down.\n\n\u201cYou have oversupplied the market, so people stopped renting their property short-term, [and] they started renting it long-term,\u201d one researcher said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s an increase in supply, and therefore that should put downward pressure on prices, and it did.\u201d\n\nStill, it may not be a universal phenomenon, when it comes to rental properties or even location. But more often than not Airbnbs will be blamed for contributing to unaffordable housing costs, and property owners and Airbnb investors will argue the opposite. Airbnb even hired its first senior housing economist, with a goal to address \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d about the housing market and Airbnb, according to Skift.\n\nDhar did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "20 Best Ways to Generate Passive Income for Beginners",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 best ways to generate passive income for beginners. We have also discussed the growing popularity of passive income for the new generation. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5Best Ways to Generate Passive Income For Beginners.\n\nHow Popular is Passive Income?\n\nPassive income, once a domain of the wealthy, has gained popularity among millennials and Gen Zers, driven by a challenging job market and social media influence. Approximately 36% of millennials are estimated to earn some form of passive income, with 20% of American households engaging in it. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have also been contributing to the rising interest, creating a feedback loop as influencers share success stories, inspiring others to follow suit.\n\nWith precarious job contracts in today\u2019s day and age, it has fueled the desire for additional income streams. As Covid-induced lockdowns also prompted a quest for greater flexibility, it aligned with Gen Z's preference for alternative working models. However, the allure of easy, low-effort income portrayed online may be misleading. Establishing a passive income stream often involves more work than anticipated, challenging the notion of purely passive earnings.\n\nIn 2023, 73% of Americans engaged in a side hustle are actively contemplating leaving their traditional jobs, highlighting a paradigm shift in work preferences. The allure of side hustles has intensified due to factors such as low minimum wages and the increasing cost of living. According to a study by NicheSites, states like Utah, despite a minimum wage of $7.25, top the charts in searches related to passive income and side hustles. This suggests that the pursuit of supplementary income is more influenced by the high cost of living than by minimum wage disparities.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic looms large and has therefore, prompted 45% of Americans to embrace side hustles as a financial safety net. With 60% expressing a preference for leaving their jobs rather than returning to a conventional five-day office week, the data highlights a strong desire for improved work-life balance and autonomy. As businesses struggle with a workforce increasingly drawn to diverse income streams, proactive employers must recognize these trends and implement measures to enhance employee satisfaction and adapt to evolving work preferences.

One popular method is utilizing the Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon), where 64% of sellers spend less than part-time hours once their business is established.

Starting her Facebook page, Everywhere with Erika, in June 2020, she shared her \"Airbnb pick of the day\" and joined Airbnb Associates\u2019s affiliate program.

In six months, she earned nearly $60,000 from Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) affiliate income, with $28,000 in September alone. Despite having a full-time consulting job and being a parent, Martin spends 2-4 hours a week on her side hustle, showing 25 Airbnbs a week.\n\nOn the other hand, Ivan Ellis Nanney, a 34-year-old Idaho native, turned a $34,000 investment into a lucrative passive income stream with Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB). After buying a $17,000 plot of land in 2015, he spent the next three-and-a-half years deconstructing an abandoned building and building a tiny home using second-hand materials. Listing it on Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) in June 2019, the property gained popularity quickly, generating $49,600 in revenue in 2022 alone. Nanney spent a couple of days annually on property maintenance, working two hours a week to organize stays, and hiring a cleaner for $150 per week.\n\nWith that said, let's move to the list of the Best Ways to Generate Passive Income for Beginners. 20 Best Ways to Generate Passive Income For Beginners\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best ways to generate passive income for beginners, we essentially tried to target methods which a) were simple b) involved minimal to no initial investment and c) were accessible to a large number of people.

Peer-to-Peer Lending\n\nPeer-to-peer lending is a lucrative passive income option for beginners due to its relatively low barrier to entry and potential for high returns. It allows individuals to lend money directly to borrowers, earning interest on their investments. This model often provides better returns than traditional savings accounts or CDs. Two popular platforms for P2P lending are Prosper and LendingClub. Prosper allows investors to diversify their portfolios by selecting loans based on risk and return profiles. LendingClub, one of the largest P2P lending platforms, offers automated investing options, simplifying the process for beginners to start earning passive income through loan investments.\n\n17.

Once developed and marketed, apps can generate income while requiring minimal ongoing effort from the creator. It is also one of the easiest forms of passive income.\n\n12. Start a Dropshipping Store\n\nUnder dropshipping, when a customer places an order, the seller purchases the product from a third-party supplier (usually a wholesaler or manufacturer) and has it shipped directly to the customer. The seller never physically handles the product. Thus, one can start an online store without holding inventory. With platforms like Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), dropshippers can earn between $1000 and $5000 per month on average with minimum hours.\n\nIt is one of the best ways to generate passive income for beginners online.\n\n11.

Staking provides a steady income stream without active trading.\n\n10. Sell Handmade Crafts on Ebay\n\nCrafters can create unique products, list them on eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and let the platform handle sales and transactions. The potential income varies based on product demand, quality, and marketing efforts. Beginners may earn anywhere from $100 to $500 per month, with the opportunity to scale as they refine their craft and establish a customer base.\n\n9. Create a Job Board\n\nA job board presents a rewarding opportunity for online entrepreneurs to generate passive income. These platforms serve as a bridge between employers looking to advertise job vacancies and individuals seeking employment opportunities. Entrepreneurs can monetize their job boards by charging employers for posting job listings and offering premium features such as sponsored jobs or unlimited access to the candidate database.\n\nWhile building the website is a relatively straightforward task, the primary challenge lies in creating awareness for the job board. Once the momentum is established, and the job board gains repeat customers, a major portion of the income becomes passive.\n\n8. Record Audiobooks\n\nRecording audiobooks is a fantastic avenue for earning passive income due to the enduring demand for audio content. Once produced, audiobooks can generate ongoing royalties with minimal ongoing effort. Platforms like Audible ACX, Findaway Voices, and Voices.com offer opportunities for narrators to showcase their talent and connect with authors or publishers seeking audiobook production services.\n\n7.

Real estate appreciates over time, offering potential for increased profits. Platforms like Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Vrbo enable property owners to effortlessly rent out their spaces to travelers, while property management services such as Buildium and Cozy streamline rental operations.\n\n6. Create Content\n\nGenerating content is a compelling means of earning passive income as it can continually attract an audience and monetize over time. Blogs on platforms like WordPress or Medium, YouTube channels, and podcast hosting services such as Anchor provide avenues for content creators to reach a global audience. Notable examples of successful content creators include Casey Neistat, a renowned vlogger, and Neil Patel, a prolific blogger and digital marketing expert.

        "title": "Semiconductor giant Arm leapfrogged Starbucks, Airbnb, and BP in the space of a day as \u2018all things AI\u2019 drives bumper sales forecast",
        "content": "In a year that will be remembered for AI, semiconductor designer Arm Holdings announced itself on the world stage with the biggest initial public offering of 2023. Its latest milestone moment means it can now be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Starbucks and Airbnb.\n\nThe U.K.-based chipmaker, which is owned by SoftBank Group, reported blockbuster earnings Thursday that helped its share price soar on the back of rising corporate demand for automated capabilities.\n\nShares in Arm rose a staggering 47.9% Thursday after the group released third-quarter results for its 2024 financial year, as the group exceeded revenue expectations and gave a big upgrade to its full-year guidance.\n\nArm is looking to its royalty business for growth, where the rising adoption of its Armv9 technology helps the company make revenues when customers sell chips that use the technology for things like computers and automobiles.\n\nThe group has been able to receive double the royalties from this technology compared with its older Armv8 offering. Sales from royalties jumped 11% in all to $425 million.\n\nArm also makes licensing revenue from the sale of its Arm CPUs, where demand is driven by \u201call things AI,\u201d according to its letter to shareholders.\n\nOverall sales rose 14% to $824 million while gross profits were up 13% to $788 million.\n\n\"Arm delivered another quarter of record revenues driven by continued adoption of the world\u2019s most pervasive compute platform,\" said Arm CEO Rene Haas.\n\n\u201cThe AI wave drove licensing growth as these new devices require Arm\u2019s performant and power-efficient compute platform.\u201d\n\nThe surprise results have set the group on a path to more record results, with Arm upgrading its guidance for the year. It expects to make up to $900 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of its financial year.\n\nArm leapfrogs tech and retail darlings\n\nInvestor's approval of the results helped Arm\u2019s market value jump to $116.8 billion by the time the NASDAQ closed Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe $37.6 billion the group added to its value in the space of a day is almost equivalent to the whole market value of credit giant Experian. The increase alone would put Arm among the world\u2019s 500 most valuable companies.\n\nIt also makes Arm more valuable than household names across the retail, tech, and energy sectors like Starbucks, Airbnb, and BP.\n\nArm is now approaching the top 10 for semiconductor stocks in terms of valuation, and will undoubtedly be looking toward European rival ASML for its next scalp.\n\nThe share price gain from ARM \"certainly helps to make the U.S. equities space interesting,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at stockbroker AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s among the beneficiaries of the race to deploy AI by countless industries. The share price movement means investors have got a new name on their radar to play the space rather than simply jumping on the Nvidia bandwagon.\u201d\n\nArm\u2019s $55 billion IPO was the biggest of 2023, as the group raised $4.87 billion from investors hungry to jump in on an AI boom that did wonders for the valuations of companies like Nvidia and Microsoft last year.\n\nThe company snubbed its home country of the U.K. to list in the U.S. in search for higher liquidity. And it got what it asked for.\n\nShares soared on the company\u2019s first day of trading thanks to massive oversubscription, a 25% increase helping it close $10 billion higher than its IPO price that opened the day.\n\nIts success has also helped lift Softbank, which owns about 90% of Arm, to a resurgence in value.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned +5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb, Inc. belongs, has gained 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +43.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.40 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +201.1%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.40 indicates a change of -47.6% from what Airbnb, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Airbnb, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Airbnb, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $2.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $9.86 billion and $11.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.4% and +12.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAirbnb, Inc. reported revenues of $3.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $2.39 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.98%. The EPS surprise was +14.9%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +43.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.16 billion, up 13.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.74% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Airbnb, Inc.\n\nFor Airbnb, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.73%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Airbnb, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Airbnb, Inc. Would post earnings of $2.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.39, delivering a surprise of +14.90%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAirbnb, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
